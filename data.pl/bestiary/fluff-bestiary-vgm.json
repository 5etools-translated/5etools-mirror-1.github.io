Jednak czarodziejstwo pozostaje rzadką pokusą.",
												"Na kartach księgi zaklęć illithid widzi system zdobywania władzy. Dzięki pismom czarodzieja, który ją napisał, illithid dostrzega działanie wysoce inteligentnego umysłu. Większość płatnerzy umysłów, którzy znajdą księgę zaklęć, reaguje na nią z odrazą lub obojętnością, ale dla niektórych księga zaklęć jest bramą do nowego sposobu myślenia.",
												"Przez pewien czas studiowanie takich zakazanych tekstów może być ukryte przed innymi illithidami, a nawet przed starszym mózgiem. Zrozumienie magii wymyka się umysłowi jak żywej istocie. W końcu jednak przychodzi zrozumienie i arkanista będący płatkarzem umysłów musi zaakceptować siebie jako dewianta i opuścić kolonię, jeśli chce przeżyć.",

												"Na początku alhoon może być trudny do odróżnienia od zwykłego płatka umysłu. Najbardziej oczywistą różnicą jest brak wszechobecnej powłoki śluzowej płatków umysłu. Bez tej ochrony skóra alhoona staje się sucha i popękana. Jego oczy mogą wydawać się wyschnięte i zapadnięte. Obie te wskazówki łatwo przeoczyć komuś, kto nie widział płatków umysłu.

Alhoon może przedłużyć swoją egzystencję, powtarzając rytuał z nowymi ofiarami, co pozwala mu na zresetowanie zegara.",
												"Zniszczenie periaptu pułapki umysłu skazuje uwięzionych w nim ludzi na zapomnienie, dlatego alhoonowie często współpracują ze sobą, aby stworzyć misterne zabezpieczenia periaptu i preferowanego miejsca rytuału. Czasami periapt pułapki umysłu powierzany jest jednemu alhoonowi, ale jest to niebezpieczna propozycja. Każdy, kto posiada periapt pułapki umysłu, zyskuje przewagę w atakach, rzutach i kontrolach przeciwko alhoonom związanym z jego stworzeniem, a te z kolei tracą przewagę w atakach, rzutach i kontrolach przeciwko posiadaczowi.",

Zamiarem mrocznych elfów było stworzenie niewolników oddanych przede wszystkim drowom, a przez połączenie z nimi - Lolth. Jak drowi udało się odkryć, dla bogini było to nie do przyjęcia.",

Drowi czarodzieje i czarnoksiężnicy używali magii magicznej i demonicznych mocy, a drowskie kapłanki przywoływały pomoc Lolth, by uzyskać boską iskrę potrzebną do zapewnienia przetrwania przedmiotu. Lolth przyglądała się temu, oczekując, że w pewnym momencie procesu te nowe obrzydlistwa zostaną jej poświęcone, ale taki rytuał nie został przeprowadzony. W odwecie za ten brak szacunku, Pajęcza Królowa zmieniła rytuały tworzenia drowów, by służyły jej własnym celom.",

Ale mroczne elfy zrozumiały swój błąd - choldrithy należały do Lolth, ciałem i duszą.

												" After devouring the troll sent by Vaprak, bones and all, a frost giant becomes an everlasting one, gaining tremendous strength, an ill temper, and a troll's regenerative ability. With these gifts, the frost giant can swiftly claim the title of jarl and easily fend off rivals for decades. However, if the frost giant doesn't give enough honor to Vaprak or fails to heed Vaprak's visions, injuries the frost giant sustains heal wrong, often resulting in discolored skin, warty scars, and vestigial body parts, such as extra digits, limbs, and even extra heads. The touch of Vaprak can no longer be hidden then, and the everlasting one is either killed or exiled by its clan. Sometimes small communities of everlasting ones gather and even reproduce, passing the \"blessing\" and worship of Vaprak from one generation to the next."

A vegepygmy can hiss and make other noises by forcing air through its mouth, but it can't speak in a conventional sense. Among themselves, vegepygmies communicate by hissing, gestures, and rhythmic tapping on the body. Vegepygmies build and craft little; any gear they have is acquired from other creatures or built by copying simple construction they have witnessed.",

Spore-bearing vegepygmies are deferred to by other vegepygmies, so outsiders refer to such vegepygmies as chiefs. A chief can expel its spores in a burst, infecting nearby creatures. If a creature dies while infected, its corpse produces vegepygmies the same way russet mold does.",
												"No one knows for sure where russet mold came from. One historical account tells of adventurers in a forbidding mountain range discovering russet mold and vegepygmies in a peculiar metal dungeon full of strange life. Another story says that explorers found russet mold in a crater left by a falling star, with vegepygmies infesting the dense jungle nearby."

If a beast such as a dog or a bear dies from russet mold, the result is a bestial moldie called a thorny result instead of a humanoid-shaped vegepygmy.

Russet mold that spreads out across a metal object can be mistaken for natural rust, and a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) or Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check is required to identify it accurately by sight in such a case.",
										"Any creature that comes within 5 feet of russet mold must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw as the mold emits a puff of spores. On a failed save, the creature becomes {@condition poisoned}. While {@condition poisoned} in this way, the creature takes 7 ({@damage 2d6}) poison damage at the start of each of its turns, sprouting mold as it takes damage. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Any magic that neutralizes poison or cures disease kills the infestation. A creature reduced to 0 hit points by the mold's poison damage dies. If the dead creature is a beast, a giant, or a humanoid, one or more newborn vegepygmies emerge from its body 24 hours later: one newborn from a Small corpse, two from a Medium corpse, four from a Large corpse, eight from a Huge corpse, or sixteen from a Gargantuan corpse.",
										"Russet mold can be hard to kill, since weapons and most types of damage do it no harm. Effects that deal acid, necrotic, or radiant damage kill 1 square foot of russet mold per 1 damage dealt. A pound of salt, a gallon of alcohol, or a magical effect that cures disease kills russet mold in a square area that is 10 feet on a side. Sunlight kills any russet mold in the light's area."
