						"Theros posiada wyjątkową właściwość metafizyczną: rzeczy, w które się tu wierzy i o których się śni, w końcu stają się rzeczywistością. Zbiorowa nieświadomość śmiertelników ma dosłowną moc tworzenia, choć proces ten trwa niezliczone wieki. Tak więc bogowie Therosu i ich słudzy byli przedmiotem wierzeń, snów i opowieści, materializując się i stając się w pełni realnymi w wyniku wiary śmiertelników w ich moc. W miarę opowiadania historii, składania ofiar i oddania przez wieki, bogowie formowali się i zyskiwali życie tak samo realne, jak śmiertelnicy, którzy ich wyśnili.",
						"Czy to oznacza, że bogowie Theros są mniej potężni lub mniej boscy niż bogowie innych światów? Wcale nie. Kiedy sen lub wiara w Theros staje się rzeczywistością, jest tak samo realna jak każda inna rzecz, a bogowie są realni od bardzo dawna. Mieszkańcy Theros wierzą, że są boscy, nieśmiertelni i wszechmocni, i tak właśnie jest.",
						"Pojedyncza osoba nie może uczynić niczego, co uczyniłoby bogów mniej realnymi lub zmieniło ich naturę. Na przykład, grożąc gniewem Helioda, śmiertelnik nie może po prostu \"nie uwierzyć\" w istnienie boga ani zmienić jego gniewu w dobroć. To zbiorowa nieświadomość każdej istoty rozumnej na Theros kształtuje rzeczywistość, a zmiany w niej zachodzą w skali wieków, a nie chwil.",
						"W praktyce więc bogowie Theros są nie mniej prawdziwi, potężni i ważni dla Theros niż bogowie innych światów dla tych światów. Co ciekawe, bogowie ci mają wpływ tylko na Theros i dwie połączone z nim płaszczyzny: Nyx, gwiezdne królestwo bogów, oraz Podziemie, ostateczny dom wszystkich zmarłych.",

								"Główny konflikt w Therosie rozgrywa się między bogami, którzy walczą ze sobą o oddanie śmiertelników. Pobożność śmiertelników jest równoznaczna z boską mocą: gdy ludzie żarliwie modlą się do boga, gdy pobożnie przestrzegają jego obrzędów i ofiar, i gdy pobożnie ufają w jego boską moc, bóg staje się potężniejszy.",
								"Rywalizacja o oddanie śmiertelników niekoniecznie jest grą o sumie zerowej. Mieszkańcy Theros nie wierzą w jednego konkretnego boga, wykluczając innych, a najbardziej pobożni ludzie modlą się do wszystkich bogów z równym zapałem. Celem bóstwa jest jednak zwiększenie liczby ludzi, którzy w obliczu niebezpieczeństwa będą wzywać go na pomoc. To właśnie zaufanie, poleganie, wiara dają bogom moc, a nie tylko idee i koncepcje.",
								"Śmiertelne istoty - zarówno bohaterowie, jak i potwory - często stają się mimowolnymi pionkami w rozgrywkach bogów. Posiadanie potężnego bohatera świadczy o potędze boga i może potencjalnie zwiększyć jego własną moc. Bohater, który działa jako przedstawiciel boga wśród innych ludzi, pomaga zwiększyć oddanie tych ludzi dla boga. A jeśli bohaterowi zdarzy się po drodze pokonać agentów konkurencyjnego boga, to tym lepiej.",

								"W sposobie myślenia śmiertelników o ich miejscu w świecie dużą rolę odgrywają dwa ściśle ze sobą powiązane pojęcia: los i przeznaczenie.",
								"Los polega na tym, że bieg życia każdego śmiertelnika jest z góry określony, utkany w gobelinie przez trzy półboskie kobiety, Losy. Bogowie nie są związani nićmi losu, ich życie i legendy ciągle się zmieniają i są nieskończenie niepewne. W przypadku większości śmiertelników uważa się, że podążają oni od początku do końca wyznaczoną ścieżką, wykonując wyznaczone im zadania, aż do zakończenia podróży do świata podziemnego.",
								"Ta dość ponura wizja egzystencji jest podważana przez ideał bohatera, który znajduje swoje odzwierciedlenie w mitach, legendach i doświadczeniach mieszkańców Theros. Bohaterowie, z definicji, to ludzie, którzy przeciwstawiają się z góry ustalonemu biegowi losu. Biorą swój los we własne ręce i wyznaczają własne ścieżki, śmiało podążając w nieznane, pokonując rzekomo niezwyciężonych wrogów i opierając się woli bogów. Ich dumne przeciwstawianie się losowi zostaje nagrodzone, gdy wreszcie kończą swoją śmiertelną podróż; godni bohaterowie spędzają swoje życie pozagrobowe w Iliji, najwspanialszym królestwie podziemnego świata, gdzie wreszcie odpoczywają od zmagań swojego życia. W wielu przypadkach ich dzieła również żyją dalej, zarówno w opowieściach przyszłych pokoleń, jak i powtarzając się na nocnym niebie wśród gwiazd Nyx.",
								"Przeznaczenie jest inne. Kosmyki przeznaczenia są przędzone z włosów starożytnego boga Klothysa, ale nie wyznaczają one z góry określonej przyszłości. Przeznaczenie ustanawia porządek rzeczy, hierarchię bytów, relacje między bogami i śmiertelnikami, instynkty i impulsy, które rządzą zachowaniem śmiertelników, oraz inne aspekty tego, jak rzeczy się mają. Zarówno bogowie, jak i śmiertelnicy są ograniczeni przez nici przeznaczenia. Śmiertelnicy niewiele mogą zrobić, by je zmienić, ale niejednokrotnie arogancja i zarozumiałość bogów sprawiły, że nici przeznaczenia zaplątały się. Bóg Klothys egzekwuje granice przeznaczenia. Jest nie tylko przędzalnią splotów przeznaczenia, ale także mścicielką, karzącą głupich bogów, którzy je splątali."

								"Czempioni bogów są jednymi z najbardziej wpływowych i inspirujących postaci w Theros. Ci śmiertelnicy mają osobiste relacje z bogami, potencjalnie służą jako boscy agenci w świecie lub są zmuszani do działania przez nieśmiertelne plany. Jeszcze inni urodzili się z boskim spojrzeniem, czy to z powodu swoich niezwykłych zdolności, czy też okoliczności narodzin. W ciągu swojego życia bohaterowie doświadczają błogosławieństw i przekleństw wynikających z boskich relacji. Niektórzy mogą posługiwać się niesamowitymi mocami, które otrzymali od bogów. Inni natomiast odkrywają, jak zmienni i mściwi potrafią być bogowie. To, jak bohater radzi sobie z kaprysami boskiego patrona, decyduje o tym, kim jest - czy szuka niesamowitych sposobów, by zaskarbić sobie nieśmiertelną przychylność, czy też podąża ścieżką, która zrzuca więzy przeznaczenia. Niezależnie od obranej drogi, czyny bohaterów wpływają na wiarę w bogów, ale co więcej, napełniają serca mieszkańców Theros nadzieją i zdumieniem.",
								"Bohaterowie odgrywają ważną rolę wśród mieszkańców Theros, nie tylko ze względu na swoje czyny. Legendarni bohaterowie tworzą rozległą kolekcję dobrze znanych archetypów, których czyny tworzą kamienie milowe kultury i kształtują współczesne filozofie. Uosabiają oni również potencjał śmiertelników, którzy mogą być czymś więcej niż tylko kroplami w szalejącej rzece losu. Opowieści o bohaterach uczą, że wielkość jest osiągalna i że świat jest czymś więcej niż to, co wie pojedyncza jednostka. Mieszkańcy Theros widzą prawdę o tym w mocach bogów i nieśmiertelnych konstelacjach, które wypełniają nocne niebo. Nawet jeśli imiona poszczególnych bohaterów mogą w końcu zaniknąć, ich czyny żyją jako archetypy bohaterów - tak jak w przypadku bezimiennego bohatera w słynnym eposie {@i The Theriad}. Te archetypy uczą i inspirują, niezależnie od tego, czy są przedstawiane w opowieściach o podróżach lub tworzeniu, w rzeźbach wznoszących się ponad dachami miast, czy w świątyniach bogów. W całym Theros ci, którzy dążą do wielkości, zazwyczaj zaczynają od decyzji, z którym archetypem bohatera są najbardziej związani i pozwalają, by ten ideał wpłynął na ich los.",
								"Bohaterowie przedstawieni w tym wprowadzeniu są przykładami archetypów heroicznych. Generał, obrońca, pogromca, łowca, zaopatrzeniowiec, wojownik, pogromca, filozof i inni podobni są wyidealizowanymi postaciami, które pojawiają się w narracji i dramacie teatralnym - czasami z imieniem, ale często bez niego. Opowieści opisują, jak Pogromca niszczy hydrę... i potężnego cyklopa, i smoka, i Nyxborna, i olbrzyma, i Lamię, i wiele innych stworzeń. Czy jeden Pogromca dokonał tego wszystkiego? Nie, archetyp ten stał się źródłem legend o wielu różnych bohaterach, z których każdy zasłużył się przede wszystkim tym, że coś zabił.",
								"Bohaterowie kampanii Therosa mogą dążyć do naśladowania jednego z wielkich heroicznych archetypów, lub też mogą starać się wykuć zupełnie nową mityczną tożsamość, aby być zapamiętanymi z imienia w opowieściach o chwale na zawsze.",

						"Kiedy gawędziarze opowiadają o historii Theros, zawsze używają najbardziej ogólnych terminów.

W Theros historia przekształca się w mit szybciej niż w innych światach, stając się uogólniona, niejasna i moralizatorska.

Wiele ludów pamięta ten okres jako czas uciążliwej niewoli, kiedy to zmuszano ich do służby w armiach tyrana Agnomakhosa. Archonci wątpliwie sugerowali, że ich rządy chronią słabsze gatunki - centaury, ludzi, leoniny, minotaury i satyry - przed niebezpieczeństwami ze strony znacznie potężniejszych istot. Mówi się, że olbrzymy, demony i meduzy rządziły w tamtych czasach własnymi królestwami, a opowieści mówią o Agnomakhosie, który poprowadził swoich leońskich żołnierzy, by odparli najazd armii olbrzymów.

W końcu lata wojny przerodziły się w niełatwy pokój, a bariera oddzielająca poleis od siebie stanowiły pustkowia Phoberos.",

A kiedy pojawia się sfinks wyrocznia Medomai i przepowiada upadek Olantinu, poeta opowiada o wcześniejszej przepowiedni Medomai o zniszczeniu Alefne - tragedii, której można było zapobiec, gdyby ktoś uwierzył w straszne ostrzeżenie sfinksa.",

Jako pierwsza śmiertelniczka rozszyfrowała tajemne wzory wiatrów (czym wywołała gniew Thassy) i przepłynęła poza granice świata do Nyx, by zająć swoje miejsce wśród gwiazd. Opowieści o jej przygodach to mityczna podróż po wyspach Dakry i wybrzeżach Theros, opisująca cały wachlarz stworzeń, narodów i cudownych zjawisk - niektóre z nich nadal istnieją, tak jak zostały opisane w wersach, inne zaś zaginęły w historii lub mitach.",

Bliższa lektura ujawnia jednak, że opowieści rozgrywają się na przestrzeni wieków, a tożsamość mistrza zmienia się z opowieści na opowieść. W rzeczywistości {@i The Theriad} jest kompilacją opowieści opisujących wyczyny wielu różnych czempionów boga słońca.

Mają oni również szeroki wpływ na aspekty świata związane z ich dziedzinami, wykraczający poza to, co można określić efektami zaklęć. Na przykład Purphoros może sprawić, że wulkan wybuchnie, a Thassa wywołać falę pływową.

Jakakolwiek bezpośrednia konfrontacja śmiertelników z bogiem wymagałaby pomocy przynajmniej jednego boga, a najlepiej więcej niż jednego, aby miała jakiekolwiek szanse powodzenia. Grupa poszukiwaczy przygód może próbować przekonać grupę bogów do udzielenia pomocy w walce z bogiem, który stał się zagrożeniem dla świata śmiertelników, mając nadzieję, że bogowie połączą siły, by powstrzymać lub ukarać przestępcę. Kruphix lub Klothys mogą być w stanie zmusić boga do przyjęcia fizycznej formy, która nie wypełnia nieba (być może coś podobnego do {@creature empyrean} lub {@creature tarrasque}), co umożliwi poszukiwaczom przygód walkę z bogiem, zwłaszcza jeśli mają dostęp do boskiej broni, takiej jak artefakty opisane w {@book chapter 5|MOT|5}.

								"Panteon Theros rozwijał się przez cztery pokolenia boskiej ewolucji. Niektóre opowieści opisują je jako rzeczywiste pokolenia, sugerując (na przykład), że bóg burzy, Keranos, jest dosłownym synem Thassy, boga morza, i Purphorosa, boga kuźni. Inni opisują pokolenia w kategoriach metaforycznych, sugerując, że Keranos reprezentuje połączenie twórczej energii Purphorosa i głębokiej wiedzy Thassy, co skutkuje błyskawicami natchnienia (a także furią fizycznej burzy). We wszystkich swoich różnorodnych formach mity są jednak zgodne co do podstawowej struktury rozwoju panteonu.",
								"Czas pierwszego pokolenia poprzedza pojawienie się tego, co powszechnie uważa się za \"bogów\". Zanim śmiertelnicy wymarzyli sobie bogów, zanim byli w stanie wyobrazić sobie istoty tak szlachetne jak bogowie, plastyczna substancja snu - Nyx - nadała kształt ich lękom w postaci tytanów.",
								"Tytani byli istotami całkowitego chaosu, reprezentującymi wszystko, co sprzeciwia się porządkowi w świecie śmiertelników. Mity opowiadają, jak bogowie walczyli i uwięzili tytanów, zamykając ich w więzieniu pod światem podziemnym. Obecnie tytani są niemal zapomniani w wyobraźni śmiertelników. W najstarszych opowieściach pojawiają się skąpe wzmianki o ich imionach i epitetach, wskazujące na koszmary, które je zrodziły. Kroxa, Tytan Głodu Śmierci, uosabiał grozę śmierci i jej nienasycony apetyt na nowe istoty do skonsumowania. Uro, Tytan Gniewu Natury, może być postrzegany jako bezpośredni poprzednik Keranosa i Thassy, lecz był on wcieleniem klęski żywiołowej, nie posiadającym nic z kreatywności i przemyślności tych bogów. Phlage, Tytan Płonącego Wiatru, był pochłaniającym wszystko wirem ognia, a Skotha, Tytan Wiecznego Mroku, był całkowitą ciemnością bezgwiezdnej nocy.",
								"Najstarszymi z bogów, których często wyobraża się sobie jako rodzeństwo lub jako odrosty tytanów, są Kruphix i Klothys. Pochodzenie tego drugiego boskiego pokolenia jest tajemnicze. Być może Klothys powstał z poczucia nieuchronności, z przekonania, że świat rozwija się tak, jak musi, a zatem działania śmiertelników nie mają większego znaczenia. Kruphix mógł zrodzić się z poczucia tajemnicy, wspierając ideę, że działanie wszechświata jest po prostu niezrozumiałe dla umysłów śmiertelników. Możliwe też, że Kruphix i Klothys to inny rodzaj istot niż tytani czy inni bogowie, a Klothys przynajmniej istnieje od niewiadomych czasów, mimo że wśród śmiertelników jest prawie zapomniany.",
								"Kiedy śmiertelnicy mogli już wyobrazić sobie świat poza horyzontem i drogę przeznaczenia, która pozostawia za sobą próby życia, mogli sformułować pojęcia zasad, porządku i prawa naturalnego. Z tych idei narodziła się trzecia generacja bóstw: Heliod o słonecznej koronie, Thassa o głębokim wnętrzu, Erebos o ponurym sercu, Purforos o brązowej krwi i Nylea o przenikliwym spojrzeniu. Wiadomo, że bogowie ci zwracają się do siebie per \"bracie\" i \"siostro\", choć nigdy nie mówią o rodzicach i prawie na pewno nie wyobrażają sobie Krufiksa i Klothysa w tej roli.",
								"Pozostałe osiem bóstw, należące do czwartej generacji, reprezentuje zastosowanie abstrakcyjnych zasad w rzeczywistości życia śmiertelników. Na przykład, podczas gdy Heliod reprezentuje uniwersalne nakazy moralne, Efara jest bogiem prawa, zasad i struktur, które rządzą śmiertelnymi społeczeństwami. Nylea jest bogiem dzikiej przyrody, drapieżnych zwierząt i zmian pór roku, a jednocześnie Karametra jest bogiem przyrody oswojonej dla potrzeb człowieka - rolnictwa i udomowienia - oraz naturalnych cykli związanych z życiem człowieka, zwłaszcza porodu.",
								"Bogowie ci uznają poprzednie pokolenie za starsze, ale tylko sporadycznie za rodziców. Iroas i Mogis są powszechnie uważani za braci, ale niewiele mitów opisuje ich pochodzenie, a te, które opisują, są wzajemnie sprzeczne - zgodnie z naturą tych wiecznie walczących bogów."

								"Niezliczone baśnie opowiadają o historii, czynach i naturze bogów. Czasami opowieści te rozgrywają się wśród gwiazdozbiorów na nocnym niebie. Są one śpiewane w hymnach podczas świąt bogów, wypisywane na ścianach świątyń, opowiadane przy ogniskach i paleniskach, a także zapisywane na zwojach. Niektóre z nich to proste bajki, które mają ilustrować jeden aspekt charakteru boga lub moralnego zachowania. Inne to monumentalne eposy, z których najbardziej znany jest {@i The Cosmogony}, poemat autorstwa bezimiennego mędrca z Meletii, zawierający kilka (czasem sprzecznych) opowieści o stworzeniu świata i nie tylko.",
								"Mieszkańcy Theros nie wzdragają się przed sprzecznymi mitami. Czy Keranos jest dosłownym dzieckiem Thassy i Purphorosa? Czy wyrósł on z serca Thassy, gdy jej gniew stał się zbyt wielki, by mogła nad nim zapanować? A może powstał, gdy Purphoros próbował wykraść tajemnice Kruphix? Dla mieszkańców Theros nie ma znaczenia, czy te opowieści opisują fakty historyczne, a każda z nich jest na swój sposób prawdziwa. Każda opowieść o Keranosie wyraża jakąś prawdę o bogu, o natchnieniu, burzach i tajemnicach. Studiowanie każdej z nich może doprowadzić czcicieli Keranosa do głębszego zrozumienia swojego boga i nawiązania z nim bliższej relacji.",
								"Różne pisma, zwykle zorganizowane wokół głównego tematu, zbierają mity o bogach. {@i The Origin of Monsters} jest jednym z takich zbiorów, wyróżniającym się próbą znalezienia wspólnego mianownika w wielu różnych opowieściach o narodzinach smoków. Opisuje również, jak Pharika ukryła tajemnice we krwi bazyliszków, jak duchy wielkich wojowników reinkarnują się w postaci mantykory i dziesiątki innych opowieści.",
								"Innym takim zbiorem jest poemat epicki {@i The Theriad}. Opisuje on wyczyny różnych czempionów Helioda, z których wszyscy są nazywani po prostu \"czempionami\", tak jakby byli jedną osobą. Ponieważ tożsamość bohaterów nie jest wymieniana, opowieści te mówią więcej o charakterze Helioda niż o śmiertelnych czynach któregokolwiek z mistrzów.",
								"{@i The Callapheia} opowiada z kolei o wyczynach jednego śmiertelnego bohatera, Kallapa Marynarza, który zakradł się na górę Velus i ukradł łzy Purphorosa, ukrył się za Phenaxem i spisał jego tajemnice, ścigał Thassę na krańcu świata, a następnie popłynął do Nyx. Opowieści tego typu podkreślają małostkowość i próżność bogów oraz propagują nieco bluźniercze przekonanie, że zwykły śmiertelnik może przechytrzyć bóstwo. {@i The Callapheia} służy również jako swego rodzaju informator o Theros, opisujący różne krainy i ich mieszkańców, przynajmniej w takim kształcie, w jakim istniały one kilka wieków temu.",
								"Wreszcie, czyny bogów są wyśpiewywane w peanach podczas ich świąt. Oczywiście hymny te przedstawiają bogów w jak najkorzystniejszym świetle, jako dobrotliwych (lub przynajmniej obojętnych) i wszechmocnych."

						"Idea istnienia bogów, która zyskiwała coraz większą popularność wśród śmiertelników Therosu, sama z siebie nie doprowadziła do powstania bogów. Śmiertelna cześć i uwielbienie przekształciły uniwersalne idee w bóstwa. Dopiero gdy śmiertelnicy zaufali bogom, że będą działać w ich imieniu, w odpowiedzi na ofiary i modlitwy, bogowie uformowali się z substancji snu Nyx. Kult pozostaje kluczowy dla mocy bogów, choć śmiertelnicy zazwyczaj nie są świadomi jego wpływu. Jeśli bóg przestałby być czczony, jego potęga zmalałaby.",
						"Najbardziej rozpowszechnioną formą wyrażania czci jest libacja, czyli wylewanie kropli wina lub wody na cześć bogów. Pobożni ludzie codziennie rano i wieczorem odprawiają prosty rytuał modlitwy i libacji przy domowym ołtarzu lub palenisku, natomiast mniej oddani mogą jeszcze wylać kropelkę wina przed wypiciem reszty.",
						"Charakterystyczną cechą świątyni Theran jest posąg boga - posąg, który bóg może w każdej chwili zająć i ożywić. Czciciele klękają przed nim, dotykają go i całują, przyozdabiają girlandami i delikatnymi tkaninami oraz składają przed nim ofiary. Te akty to czasem spontaniczne wylanie miłości lub wdzięczności, a czasem prośby, w których błaga się boga o wyleczenie z choroby, zesłanie deszczu na plony, zagwarantowanie bezpiecznej podróży lub o inną przysługę związaną ze sferą wpływów boga.",

						"Kiedy wybierasz boga, którego chcesz czcić jako postać początkująca, Twój wynik pobożności związany z tym bogiem wynosi 1. Twój wynik pobożności wzrasta o 1, kiedy robisz coś, co sprzyja interesom boga lub zachowujesz się zgodnie z jego ideałami. Bogowie oczekują wielkich czynów od swoich bohaterów, więc twój wynik pobożności zazwyczaj wzrasta tylko wtedy, gdy osiągniesz znaczący cel (taki jak ukończenie przygody), poświęcisz się dla własnych interesów lub w inny sposób, gdy DM uzna to za stosowne. Opis każdego boga w tym rozdziale zawiera omówienie jego celów i ideałów, które DM wykorzystuje do oceny, czy zasługujesz na zwiększenie liczby punktów pobożności. Ogólnie rzecz biorąc, możesz oczekiwać, że podczas większości sesji gry zwiększysz swoją pobożność o 1, zakładając, że postępujesz zgodnie z zasadami swojego boga. DM decyduje o wielkości tego wzrostu lub spadku, ale pojedynczy czyn zazwyczaj zmienia twój wynik pobożności tylko o 1 punkt w obie strony, chyba że twoje działanie jest bardzo znaczące.",

A god can't speak a deliberate lie in response to either spell, but they can be evasive while remaining within the boundaries of the truth.

This might happen because another god, alerted to the connection between the caster and their god by the first casting of the spell, intercepts the second one and chooses to mislead the character.

Whenever Nylea drew close, the great cat vanished into the forest's shadows. Seasons passed as the god loosed arrow after arrow at the lynx, but her efforts remained fruitless. Nylea eventually abandoned the hunt, only to find the feline waiting for her at the edge of a stream the next evening. The hunt resumed, but with the same outcome. It continued like that for some time, until Nylea began to grow fond of the beast. Soon, the pair started hunting together, and the lynx, which she called Halma, became one of Nylea's confidants."

								"Sometimes the answer to a riddle is lost beyond the inky waters of the Tartyx River. When spells and sages fail to recover some crucial bit of information, how far might heroes go to recover it? One answer is to dare an expedition into the Underworld to find what was lost. Entering the Underworld is arguably one of the easiest feats imaginable—everyone ends up there when they die. Entering while still alive, and in such a way as to be able to walk out again, is another matter entirely.",
								"Legends tell of places where the boundary between the mortal world and the Underworld is weak. These paths lie beyond lands controlled by the poleis and other civilized beings. Dark caves with tunnels leading down into darkness and rivers quietly lapping at fog-shrouded gravel shores give way to the Underworld's borders. Though Athreos ferries the dead across the Tartyx, he's not above accepting a one-way fare from those who still breathe. Even the other fearsome Underworld guardians that keep watch over the dead often allow the living to enter. Leaving the Underworld isn't so simple, and once beyond the Tartyx River the living find themselves in the same predicament as the dead. Within the Underworld, characters who entered bodily are still fully alive. They age, suffer damage, heal naturally, and require air, food, drink, and sleep as normal. The Underworld isn't conducive to mortal life, though, and between deadly creatures and dangerous otherworldly environments, the living might soon find themselves numbering among the dead.",
								"Characters can pursue all manner of goals to the Underworld. Many center on finding something that was lost with no other means available to recover it. Perhaps this means rescuing a dead soul when resurrection magic isn't an option or retrieving a vital piece of information from someone who wasn't supposed to die. This might even mean pursuing the soul of a player character, particularly if they're somehow barred from being returned to life through usual magical means. In such a case, consider allowing the player to run a temporary character who assists the party in the rescue or to play their own character as a soul and let them rejoin the party to help effect their own escape.",
								"Regardless of why living characters might enter the Underworld, those who attempt the undertaking might seek to learn more about the realm of the dead, its various wards (see {@book chapter 3|MOT|3|The Underworld}), and where the object of their quest ended up. Oracles of any of the gods might aid in divining these details, but those likely to be the most precise—followers of Erebos—are also the least likely to be interested in aiding an Underworld escape. How characters turn such an oracle to their side and determine the accuracy of the information they receive are all part of such a momentous quest.",
