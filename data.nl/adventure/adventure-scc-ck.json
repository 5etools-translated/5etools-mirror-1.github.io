Als dit water eenmaal een alchemistisch proces heeft ondergaan in de laboratoria van de faculteit van Witherbloom, wordt de resulterende eldritch balsem gebruikt om voorwerpen op magische wijze te behandelen en te versterken, van voorraadkisten tot kookvaten tot decorstukken en meer.

														"If you're running all four adventures in this book as a campaign, a character spots a small, oilskin-wrapped journal sitting atop a small stump. Water damage has rendered much of the journal unreadable, but what remains reveals sinister thoughts. It's clear that some nefarious personality has been experimenting with life-draining magic in the marsh and has been doing so for some time.",
														"The journal belonged to the evil {@creature Murgaxor|SCC}; it slipped out of his pocket while he practiced the corrupting magic that caused this academic year's mishaps. The journal notes that {@creature Murgaxor|SCC}'s last step in this scheme involved the Rose Stage Festival, so it's clear he has no more immediate plans to threaten campus. However, this isn't the end of his villainy—the true extent becomes clear in later adventures.",
