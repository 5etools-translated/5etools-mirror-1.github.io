Net als die spellen, wordt D&D gedreven door verbeelding. Het gaat erom het torenhoge kasteel onder de stormachtige nachthemel voor te stellen en je voor te stellen hoe een fantasie-avonturier zou reageren op de uitdagingen die dat tafereel biedt.",

Afbrokkelende torens van steen houden een stille wacht over de nadering. Ze zien eruit als verlaten wachthuizen. Achter deze torens gaapt een brede kloof, die verdwijnt in de diepe mist eronder. Een neergelaten ophaalbrug overspant de kloof en leidt naar een boogvormige toegang tot de binnenplaats van het kasteel. De kettingen van de ophaalbrug kraken in de wind, het roestige ijzer spant onder het gewicht. Bovenop de hoge sterke muren staren stenen waterspuwers je aan vanuit holle kassen en grijnzen afschuwelijk. Een rottend houten valhek, groen van de groei, hangt in de toegangstunnel. Daarachter staan de hoofddeuren van Castle Ravenloft open, een rijk, warm licht valt binnen op de binnenplaats.",

Zichzelf vastbinden met touw om de kans te verkleinen dat iemand valt als de ophaalbrug het begeeft? Of spreken ze een spreuk uit om hen over de kloof te dragen? Dan bepaalt de DM de resultaten van de acties van de avonturiers en vertelt wat ze meemaken.

Veel mensen die het spel spelen houden hun campagnes maanden of jaren vol, waarbij ze elke week of zo met hun vrienden samenkomen om het verhaal op te pakken waar ze gebleven waren. De avonturiers groeien in kracht naarmate de campagne vordert. Elk monster dat wordt verslagen, elk avontuur dat wordt voltooid en elke schat die wordt teruggevonden, draagt niet alleen bij tot het verdere verhaal, maar geeft de avonturiers ook nieuwe mogelijkheden. Deze toename in kracht wordt weerspiegeld in het niveau van de avonturier.",

Soms komt een avonturier op een griezelige manier aan zijn einde, verscheurd door woeste monsters of in de val gelokt door een snode schurk. Desondanks kunnen de andere avonturiers op zoek gaan naar krachtige magie om hun gevallen kameraad weer tot leven te wekken, of de speler kan ervoor kiezen een nieuw personage te creëren om verder te gaan. De groep kan er niet in slagen een avontuur tot een goed einde te brengen, maar als iedereen een leuke tijd heeft gehad en een gedenkwaardig verhaal heeft gemaakt, winnen ze allemaal.",

Sommige rassen hebben ongewone eigenschappen in verschillende werelden. De halflingen in de Dark Sun-setting zijn bijvoorbeeld kannibalen die in de jungle leven, en de elfen zijn woestijnnomaden. Sommige werelden hebben rassen die in andere settings onbekend zijn, zoals de war-forged van Eberron, soldaten die zijn gemaakt en doordrenkt met leven om te vechten in de Laatste Oorlog. Sommige werelden worden gedomineerd door één groot verhaal, zoals de Oorlog van de Lance die een centrale rol speelt in de Dragonlance setting. Maar het zijn allemaal D&D werelden, en je kunt de regels in dit boek gebruiken om een karakter te creëren en in een van deze werelden te spelen.",
						"Uw DM kan de campagne op een van deze werelden zetten of op een wereld die hij of zij zelf gecreëerd heeft. Omdat er zoveel diversiteit is tussen de werelden van D&D, moet u met uw DM overleggen over huisregels die uw spel of het spel zullen beïnvloeden.

						"{@b 2. The players describe what they want to do.} Soms spreekt één speler voor het ganse gezelschap en zegt, \"We nemen de oostelijke deur,\" bijvoorbeeld. Andere keren doen verschillende avonturiers verschillende dingen: één avonturier kan een schatkist doorzoeken terwijl een tweede een esoterisch symbool onderzoekt dat op een muur gegraveerd is en een derde houdt de wacht voor monsters. De spelers hoeven niet om beurten te spelen, maar de DM luistert naar elke speler en beslist hoe deze acties opgelost worden.",
						"Soms is het oplossen van een opdracht gemakkelijk. Als een avonturier door een kamer wil lopen en een deur openen, kan de DM zeggen dat de deur open gaat en beschrijven wat er achter ligt. Maar de deur kan op slot zitten, de vloer kan een dodelijke val verbergen, of een andere omstandigheid kan het voor een avonturier moeilijk maken om een opdracht uit te voeren. In deze gevallen beslist de DM wat er gebeurt, vaak vertrouwend op de worp van een dobbelsteen om de resultaten van een actie te bepalen.",

						"In bepaalde situaties, met name gevechten, is de actie meer gestructureerd en kiezen de spelers (en DM) om de beurt acties en lossen ze op. Maar meestal is het spel vloeiend en flexibel, en past het zich aan de omstandigheden van het avontuur aan.",
						"Vaak speelt de actie van een avontuur zich af in de verbeelding van de spelers en de DM, vertrouwend op de verbale beschrijvingen van de DM om de scène te zetten. Sommige DM's gebruiken graag muziek, kunst, of opgenomen geluidseffecten om de sfeer te helpen bepalen, en veel spelers en DM's nemen verschillende stemmen aan voor de verschillende avonturiers, monsters, en andere personages die ze in het spel spelen. Soms kan een DM een kaart uitzetten en fiches of miniatuurfiguurtjes gebruiken om elk wezen dat betrokken is in een scène voor te stellen om de spelers te helpen bijhouden waar iedereen is.",

Twee nullen staan voor 100. Sommige dobbelstenen met tien ogen zijn genummerd in tientallen (00, 10, 20, enzovoort), waardoor het gemakkelijker is om het cijfer tien van het cijfer enen te onderscheiden. In dit geval is een worp van 70 en 1 71, en 00 en 0 is 100.",
								"Wanneer je dobbelstenen moet gooien, vertellen de regels je hoeveel dobbelstenen je van een bepaald type moet gooien, en welke modifiers je moet toevoegen. Bijvoorbeeld, \"3d8 + 5\" betekent dat je drie dobbelstenen van acht gooit, ze bij elkaar optelt, en 5 aan het totaal toevoegt.",

Om de worp van 1d2 te simuleren, gooi een willekeurige dobbelsteen en geef een 1 of een 2 aan de worp, afhankelijk van of deze oneven of even was.

Op andere momenten praten de avonturiers met een ander wezen (of zelfs een magisch object) met een doel voor ogen. En vaak proberen de avonturiers een puzzel op te lossen, een obstakel te omzeilen, iets verborgen te vinden, of de huidige situatie te ontrafelen. Ondertussen verkennen de avonturiers de wereld en nemen ze beslissingen over welke weg ze zullen volgen en wat ze zullen proberen te doen.",

Gevechten zijn het meest gestructureerde element van een D&D sessie, met wezens die om beurten spelen om ervoor te zorgen dat iedereen een kans krijgt om te handelen. Zelfs in de context van een gevecht is er nog genoeg gelegenheid voor avonturiers om gekke stunts uit te halen zoals van een trap af surfen op een schild, om de omgeving te onderzoeken (misschien door een mysterieuze hendel over te halen), en om te communiceren met andere wezens, inclusief bondgenoten, vijanden, en neutrale partijen."

Andere personages krijgen eigenschappen die hen in staat stellen meer aanvallen uit te voeren of indrukwekkender dingen te doen met die aanvallen. Deze machtige avonturiers staan vaak tegenover bedreigingen van hele regio's en continenten.",

His lawful evil alignment gives him ideals of impartiality and a lust for power. Tika Waylan's bond is to the Inn of the Last Home. The inn's proprietor gave her a new chance at life, and her friendship with her adventuring companions was forged during her time working there. Its destruction by the marauding dragonarmies gives Tika a very personal reason to hate them with a fiery passion. Her bond might be phrased \"I will do whatever it takes to punish the dragonarmies for the destruction of the Inn of the Last Home.\"Artemis Entreri's bond is a strange, almost paradoxical relationship with Drizzt Do'Urden, his equal in swordplay and grim determination. In his first battle with Drizzt, Artemis recognized something of himself in his opponent, some indication that if his life had gone differently, might have led a life more like the heroic drow's. From that moment, Artemis is more than a criminal assassin—he is an antihero, driven by his rivalry with Drizzt. His bond might be phrased as \"I will not rest until I have proved myself better than Drizzt Do'Urden.\"Each of these characters also has an important flaw. Tika Waylan is naive and emotionally vulnerable, younger than her companions and annoyed that they still think of her as the kid they knew years ago.

When gods walk the world, clerics channel divine power, evil cults perform dark sacrifices in subterranean lairs, and shining paladins stand like beacons against the darkness, it's hard to be ambivalent about the deities and deny their existence.",

People in the Forgotten Realms, for example, might pray to Sune for luck in love, make an offering to Waukeen before heading to the market, and pray to appease Talos when a severe storm blows in—all in the same day. Many people have a favorite among the gods, one whose ideals and teachings they make their own. And a few people dedicate themselves entirely to a single god, usually serving as a priest or champion of that god's ideals. Your DM determines which gods, if any, are worshiped in his or her campaign. From among the gods available, you can choose a single deity for your character to serve, worship, or pay lip service to. Or you can pick a few that your character prays to most often. Or just make a mental note of the gods who are revered in your DM's campaign so you can invoke their names when appropriate. If you're playing a cleric or a character with the Acolyte background, decide which god your deity serves or served, and consider the deity's suggested domains when selecting your character's domain.",

								"The world of Eberron has many different religions, but the most important revolves around a pantheon called the Sovereign Host and their malign shadow, the Dark Six. The gods of the Sovereign Host are thought to have dominion over every aspect of existence, and to speak with a unified voice. But the Dark Six are the primitive, bloody, and cruel gods who offer a dissenting voice. Eberron's other religions are very different from the traditional D&D pantheons. The monotheistic Church of the Silver Flame is devoted to fighting against evil in the world, but plagued by corruption in its own ranks. The philosophy of the Blood of Vol teaches that divinity lies within all mortal beings and reveres the undead who have secured that immortality. Various mad cults are devoted to the demons and horrors imprisoned in Eberron's Underdark (called Khyber, the Dragon Below). The followers of the Path of Light believe that the world is heading toward a glorious future where the shadows that cloud this world will be transformed into light. And two related nations of elves revere their ancestral spirits: the Undying Court, preserved as spirits or even undead forms, and the glorified Spirits of the Past, the great heroes of ancient wars.",

They sprang from the brook and stream, their might heightened by the strength of the oak and the beauty of the woodlands and open moor. When the first forester dared put a name to the face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a brook, these gods forced themselves into being. The Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by clerics, for they are closely aligned with the forces of nature that druids revere.",

The warriors of the land have had to adapt to the harsh conditions in order to survive, but they haven't been too twisted by the needs of their environment. Given the necessity of raiding for food and wealth, it's surprising the mortals turned out as well as they did.

Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling trek across a single layer.",

								"The planes with some element of good in their nature are called the {@b Upper Planes.} Celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in the Upper Planes. Planes with some element of evil are the {@b Lower Planes.} Fiends such as demons, devils, and yugoloths dwell in the Lower Planes. A plane's alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn't match the plane's experiences a profound sense of dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example, it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable."

That argument might be circular, however, for it is possible that the arrangement of the Outlands inspired the idea of the Great Wheel in the first place.",

There is a brisk trade in information about the planes, in particular in the command words or items required for the operation of particular portals.

They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that has been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in power.

Unspeakable things whisper awful truths to those who dare listen. For mortals, knowledge of the Far Realm is a triumph of mind over the rude boundaries of matter, space, and eventually sanity.",

Ancient elves once pierced the boundary of eons with a vast portal to the Far Realm within a mountain called Firestorm Peak, but their civilization imploded in bloody terror and the portal's location—even its home world—is long forgotten. Other portals might still exist, marked by the alien forces leaking through to corrupt the Material Plane around them."
