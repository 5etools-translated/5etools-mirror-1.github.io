						"Vanaf het begin was Magic's plane Zendikar bedoeld als een \"avonturenwereld\" waar groepen ontdekkingsreizigers oude ruïnes induiken op zoek naar wonderen en schatten, en onderweg vechten tegen de monsters die ze tegenkomen. Veel van de creatieve wortels van dit gebied liggen in D&D, dus het zal geen verrassing zijn dat The Art of Magic: The Gathering-Zendikar veel weg heeft van een D&D campaign setting boek. Het is bezaaid met avontuur haken en verhaal zaden, en mist alleen de specifieke regels referenties die je nodig zou hebben om Zendikar's rassen, monsters, en avonturen aan te passen aan een tabletop D&D campagne. En het is allemaal omgeven door verbazingwekkende fantasy kunst die grenzeloze inspiratie in zich draagt.",
						"Je kunt Plane Shift: Zendikar als een soort supplement bij The Art of Magic: The Gathering-Zendikar, ontworpen om je te helpen de details van de wereld en de verhaalzaden uit dat boek te gebruiken en ze om te zetten in een spannende D&D campagne. De makkelijkste manier om een D&D campagne op Zendikar te benaderen is om de regels te gebruiken die D&D levert, meestal zoals ze geschreven zijn: Een druïde op Zendikar kan groene mana oproepen en spreuken zoals reuzengroei oproepen, maar ze is nog steeds gewoon een druïde volgens de D&D regels (misschien kan ze reuzeninsecten oproepen).",
						"Plane Shift: Zendikar is gemaakt met behulp van de vijfde editie van de D&D regels die je hier kunt vinden",
						"D&D is een flexibel regelsysteem, ontworpen om elke fantasiewereld te modelleren. Het D&D magiesysteem bevat geen vijf kleuren mana of een opvoering naar je krachtigste spreuken, maar het doel is ook niet om de ervaring van het spelen van Magic te spiegelen in je rollenspel. Het doel is om de werelden van Magie op een nieuwe manier te ervaren, door de lens van de D&D regels. Alles wat je echt nodig hebt zijn rassen voor de karakters, monsters waar ze mee te maken krijgen, en wat ideeën om een campagne op te bouwen.",
						"Finally, The Art of Magic: The Gathering—Zendikar will help you create a D&D campaign in Zendikar, but you don't actually need the book to make use of this material—you can also refer to the abundance of lore about Zendikar found on {@link magicthegathering.com}."

						"Zendikar is a dangerous world of lethal risks and priceless rewards. From the perspective of its inhabitants, it is a hostile place that seems to be actively trying to kill any creature that has the audacity to live there. The danger is unrelenting. Precarious terrain, cunning predators, and natural disasters on a massive scale all present a constant challenge to survival—as do the unpredictable ripples of change that wash through the plane, known to its people as the Roil. Even the mana that suffuses the land is wild and hard to tame. It feels almost alive to those who wield it, and sometimes causes the land to manifest magical effects much like spells. Zendikar is a plane of deadly peril, but the denizens of that plane grow up strong and resilient, prepared for the dangers of the only world they know.",
						"Planeswalkers—powerful mages with the ability to travel from world to world in the vast multiverse—have a larger perspective. To them, the dangers of Zendikar take on a different meaning. Ages ago, three alien beings of tremendous power were imprisoned on Zendikar in an effort to prevent them from consuming the entire multiverse, plane by plane. But the presence of these Eldrazi within the plane is like a festering infection within a living body. Zendikar isn't trying to exterminate all the creatures that inhabit the plane—it's been trying in vain to destroy the Eldrazi. Its inhabitants just happen to get in the way.",
						"After centuries of being trapped in their magical prison, the Eldrazi are once again free. The other dangers of Zendikar pale in comparison to the rampaging of the three titans and the numberless broods they spawn. Civilization on Zendikar, always fragile and tentative, now teeters on the brink of destruction, and the plane itself seems threatened with extinction.",

Bold heroes, covetous treasure hunters, and sages seeking long-forgotten lore can all find numerous ruins to explore, mysteries to uncover, and villains and monsters to slay. Expeditionary houses, academic institutions, wealthy merchants, and retired adventurers all sponsor missions of exploration and discovery. Caravans need guards to protect them from bandits, predators, and the Roil. At the same time, the schemes of villains—from the underhanded vampire sage Anowon to the monstrous demon Planeswalker Ob Nixilis—draw would-be heroes in like moths to the flame."

								"Zendikar is littered with ancient sites ripe for exploration. Before the rise of the Eldrazi, expeditions to such sites were largely motivated by curiosity, the hunt for wealth or fame, or quests for magical power. Since the Eldrazi broke free of their prison, though, brave explorers have delved into these ruins in hopes of learning more about the threat they face—and how to stop it.",

												"Before the Eldrazi ever came to Zendikar, it was not an especially remarkable world. It had powerful mana and boasted mighty civilizations of humans (on all seven continents), kor (primarily in Ondu and Akoum), elves (primarily in Murasa and Bala Ged), and merfolk (primarily in Tazeem, Guul Draz, and Sejiri). Ruins from this era naturally suggest no knowledge of the Eldrazi or the three gods inspired by the Eldrazi titans. These civilizations had their own gods, unrecognizable to contemporary eyes. In modern times, before the rise of the Eldrazi, these civilizations were often mistakenly identified as \"Eldrazi,\" giving rise to a number of misconceptions about the nature of those alien creatures.",
												"The time before the Eldrazi was an age of powerful magic. Ruins from this era are often warded by magical traps, but they offer commensurate rewards in the form of magic items and other magical effects (such as healing fountains). They are often haunted by spirits, shades, and wraiths, and lingering magical effects make them attractive homes for demons. Magical constructs and golems can also be found in such ruins (though not constructs made from hedrons), often standing guard over treasure vaults. Of course, some ruins have been exposed to the elements and claimed as lairs by natural animals or goblins. Monetary treasure in the ruins of Zendikar is often in the form of gems or precious art objects, but they also hold ancient coins of strange provenance, including electrum and platinum.",
												"It is possible that living descendants of these ancient civilizations still inhabit particularly remote ruins. Such inhabitants might be monstrously degenerated from their original forms—kuo-toa with only the vaguest resemblance to their merfolk ancestors, or tieflings or yuan-ti descended from human cultures that polluted their bloodlines with dark magic.",

Before that fall, though, powerful nations mustered mighty armies and great magic to fight the Eldrazi spawn that swarmed over the world. They harnessed existing magic as well as the power of Nahiri's hedrons to aid their efforts, and magical technology from this era is now highly sought after with the threat of the Eldrazi renewed. Magical weapons, often incorporating patterns that resemble the engravings on the hedrons, are often found in the ruins of this age. Likewise, scrolls and tomes containing knowledge of the Eldrazi and spells useful for binding or destroying them can still be found in ancient libraries of the Eldrazi era.",

The Roil destroyed many settlements, and the kor began their nomadic lifestyle. Over time, the true nature of the Eldrazi horror was forgotten, and artistic representations of the titans as the gods of the merfolk and kor appeared in temples. Among the kor, these images were sometimes accompanied by statues of Nahiri, the \"prophet of Talib\" who taught her people the stoneforge arts.",
