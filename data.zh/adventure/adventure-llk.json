						"在很久以前的几个世纪里，一个名叫Kwalish的普通学者在屏障之峰发现了奇怪的魔法之后，走上了一条不可能的道路，成为有史以来最强大的奥术发明家之一。他对一个古老的、坠毁的平面飞行器的研究使他走上了一条可能与伊昂和休沃德相抗衡的道路--直到他的实验超越了他，而他也迷失在了岁月中。他的遗产只剩下他最早的作品的一个例子--{@item Apparatus of Kwalish}，这是大多数人现在知道他名字的唯一途径。",
						"夸里什进入壁垒峰，开始了他的高级研究，当时他加入了一个命运多舛的探险队，寻找Daoine Gloine，一个传说中由玻璃生物居住的城市。虽然他的队伍中的其他人在途中丧生，但夸里什偶然发现了一艘残破的平面飞船，并花了数年时间探索其秘密。他甚至将这艘飞船的大部分独特的魔法技术重新用于他的第一个实验室，建造他自己设计的平面门。",
						"测试一个这样的门，因为它与九层地狱建立了联系，吸引了一个骨魔的注意。追踪Kwalish回到各个星球，骨魔为自己占领了这位发明家的实验室。夸里什成功逃脱，但留下了他的大部分理论，而骨魔则在随后的几年里将这里改造成了一个黑暗的修道院，并建立了自己的邪教。",
						"在山里徘徊了很久之后，夸里什搬到了一个同样偏远的地方--道恩-格洛因，那是他的探险队最初寻找的神秘城市。这个地方与世隔绝，是一个适合他继续研究的地方。然而，这里的居民并不像传说中的那样是玻璃生物，而是崇拜一个具有将受害者变成玻璃的独特能力的美杜莎的肯库部族。",
						"在夸里什被混乱的肯库和他们疯狂的美杜莎弄得遭受同样的命运之前，他再次打开了一道平面门，这次是通往深渊的第222层--吉布利克斯的粘液坑，他从那里召唤出了可怕的粘液瘟疫来清除城市，帮助他保卫他的新实验室。",
						"夸里什切断了所有通往道恩-格洛因的通道，而这座城市也消失在岁月中。从此，这位传奇的发明家就没有了消息。只是现在，这些人物急需他的帮助......",

Occasionally, travelers would return from the mountains with wild claims of having been lost in the peaks and visiting the city by accident. And though none of them could produce a full map showing the route they took, their stories all shared a common element—that Daoine Gloine was populated by creatures made of living glass, tended to by kenku in love with those creatures' shining beauty. These occasional tales drove more explorers—including Kwalish's own expedition—to seek out the route to Daoine Gloine and learn the truth of who dwelled there.",

In ages past, the kenku that inhabited the city captured a unique medusa—{@creature Gloine Nathair-Nathair|IMR}, whose gaze could transform victims into glass instead of stone. A cult of the medusa arose to worship the creature, which was effectively incarcerated within a central temple. Kenku priests brought regular sacrificial victims—both willing and unwilling—to stand before the medusa's gaze. And when {@creature Gloine Nathair-Nathair|IMR} died, the kenku raised her in undeath to prolong their cult, continuing to fill their city with glass statues.",

Desperate, Kwalish constructed another planar gateway while imprisoned in the temple, then opened a portal to the 222nd layer of the Abyss—Juiblex's Slime Pits. A flood of ooze issued forth, driving the kenku from Daoine Gloine and effectively sealing the city away from the rest of the world.",

				"The unique magical-mechanical crafting techniques seen in the Monastery of the Distressed Body and the lost city of Daoine Gloine are the basis of a number of unique magic items found in the adventure. Because of their power and rarity, the items in this section (or at least those that aren't cursed) are best suited for characters in a high-magic campaign. Alternatively, treat each item as the equivalent of two or more magic items appropriate for characters of 5th to 10th level.",
				"You can also treat this section as potential treasure for future play at higher levels. Some of these items might be experiments that Kwalish is working on, which can be made available to the characters if they return to the Barrier Peaks. Alternatively, if you'd like to make full use of these items during the adventure but don't want to make them part of your long-term campaign, some of them might function only in the monastery or Daoine Gloine, while others might be charge-dependent. When an item's charges run dry, its magic drains away—or the item might malfunction or explode, with effects determined by you.",

If Kwalish's notes can't be deciphered (or if the inventor doesn't show up when the characters need him), you might ask for successful Intelligence checks on the Figuring Out Alien Technology table from anyone trying to operate magical technology. It might take one success to operate a trinket, two successes to operate a force pike or a teleportation-field device, and four successes to operate Kwalish's {@i powered armor}.",

							"One adventurer I heard of came back safe from an expedition to the Barrier Peaks—then promptly grew extra arms, turned purple, and lost his ability to speak.

						],
						[
							"51",
							"Folk dwelling in the foothills of the peaks have been caught wandering as if in a trance into the mountains. When rescued, all reported the same thing: a long, bony finger beckoned them into the darkness, where writhing tendrils waited to snatch them up."

							"Somewhere deep within the peaks lies the lost tower of Mundar, named after a gnome wizard who loved children and created many magnificent magical toys. Those who claim to have found the tower tell tales of giant teddy bears and toy soldiers that guard against those who would ransack its workshop."

						],
						[
							"59",
							"A farmer says he saw a metal humanoid wandering through the foothills while he was tending his sheep.

						],
						[
							"61",
							"It's said that the spirits of twin children haunt the Barrier Peaks—poor tykes who froze to death looking to pick flowers for their mother. Each seeks the other now, lost forever and begging strangers for aid. Tales talk of how one spirit will lead explorers to safety, while the other guarantees malicious calamity."
						],

							"The tarrasque dwells within the deepest caverns of the Barrier Peaks—but the creature is undead, held in a perpetual state of decay."
						],
						[
							"64",
							"Rumors tell of an iron fortress nestled deep within the Barrier Peaks.

The gods delivered this fortress, some say, and no mortal can enter without their permission."
						],
						[
							"65",
							"A small group of humans and dwarves went into the Barrier Peaks seeking archeological finds. News was promising at first, including reports of a cave that held artifacts from ages long past, and the remains of creatures unlike anything ever discovered before. Then all word from the expedition suddenly ceased..."

						],
						[
							"75",

						],
						[
							"88",
							"People know the Barrier Peaks but often forget what it is they were named for. Those mountains make a protective wall guarding civilized lands from the nightmares and dark magic that spawn on their far side. And every time some explorer cuts a new trail across the peaks, that barrier weakens."
						],
						[
							"89",
							"Folk talk about the Barrier Peaks as home to wraiths and other apparitions, but I say those mountains are a laboratory for the mind flyers. I've walked those trails.

Many's the explorer that's used stars and compass to plot a course, only to find themselves back at the beginning edge of the place where the trip began."
						],
						[
							"100",
							"The Soul Catcher, they call it. Its victims stagger out of the Barrier Peaks with nary a scratch on their bodies, but their hearts aren't right anymore. The lucky ones are caught by the healers and confined to places where they can't hurt anyone. The ones who aren't so lucky... Well, you tell me. What would you call an adventurer who can't feel the slightest tinge of remorse or guilt or fear?"
