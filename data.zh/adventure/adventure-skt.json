						"野蛮人边境（又称北方）是一片寒冷、崎岖、人烟稀少的土地，由雪山、岩石山、无垠的森林和多雾的山谷组成。孤立的堡垒、古老的坟冢和许多被遗忘的帝国的废墟点缀着这片广阔的土地。西边是剑海，东边是阿诺罗奇沙漠，野蛮人边境向北延伸到冰风谷，向南延伸到达格福特镇。古老的道路在这片广阔的土地上延伸，将山区的矮人据点和矿场与沿海的定居点、边境城镇以及人类和其他民族的坚固前哨连接起来。这些道路漫长、孤独，或者防守不力，使得它们在穿越时很危险。在肥沃的山谷中，城镇和城市如雨后春笋般涌现，它们之间隔着几十甚至几百英里的未开垦的荒野，那里有强盗、野蛮人和怪物出没。",
						"被它们的黑暗女王提亚马特煽动起来的邪恶巨龙，曾一度威胁到野蛮边境的定居点。最终，它们被打败并被迫撤回它们的巢穴，而提亚马特被放逐到九层地狱。随着新威胁的到来，对龙的愤怒的恐惧迅速消退：巨人。北方的人民对巨人的入侵并不陌生。长期以来，冰霜巨人一直声称世界之脊是他们的领地，而山丘巨人也被称为在未被驯服的山丘上觅食。但现在，在过去的几个月里，各种类型的巨人都从他们的据点里出来，以前所未有的方式威胁着人类文明--不仅仅是冰霜巨人和山丘巨人，还有石巨人、火巨人和云巨人。所有的巨人都在骚动。关于整个北方的巨人攻击的报告已经传到了卢斯坎、永夜和水底的沿海城市，激起了人们对巨人正在对人类、矮人、精灵和其他小民发动战争的担忧。",

								"巨人社会（比如说）在很大程度上是由秩序决定的，这是一个由他们的神明强加给巨人的种姓制度，其中最主要的是全能之父安南。等级制度决定了一个巨人在他或她的同族中的地位。传统上，风暴巨人一直站在阶级的顶端。他们高大而强大，努力阻止弱小的巨人种族掠夺小民的领域并引发冲突。最伟大的风暴巨人是强大的预言家，善于识别和解释宇宙的迹象和神圣的预兆。冷漠而贵族化的云巨人，比风暴巨人低一级，很少屈尊与低等巨人或小民打交道。奢侈的生活决定了他们的文化和他们在军团中的地位。在他们之下是暴虐的、好战的火巨人和无情的、掠夺性的冰霜巨人。火巨人以他们的锻造技术为标准，而冰霜巨人则以他们的武艺为标准。靠近底层的是排外的石巨人，他们大多生活在地下，把地面世界看作是一个梦境。他们对石头的雕琢程度决定了他们在同龄人中的地位。真正的巨人中最低级和最小的是山丘巨人，他们既贪吃又令人厌恶。山地巨人是呆子，他们生活在对他们更强大的巨人表亲的恐惧之中。在山地巨人社会中，最大的统治者。",

								"最近，龙为将提亚马特带入世界所做的努力（如冒险故事{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}和{@i The Rise of Tiamat}中所述），以及小人物为挫败他们所做的尝试，使巨神们非常不满，全能之父安纳姆打破了巨人们之间的秩序，使他的 \"孩子们 \"不再自满，让六种类型的巨人互相对立，同时保持每种类型中某种秩序的样子。这样一来，安南就刺激了云、火、霜、石和山丘巨人去挑战既定的等级制度，重新塑造他们的命运。所有的巨人都立刻感觉到了这种动荡，现在各类型的巨人都在激烈地相互竞争，力争通过他们的行为和成就创造一个新的秩序。这些巨人的灾难性努力不仅使人类和其他小民的定居点处于危险之中，而且还吸引了巨人的古老敌人--龙的注意，它们不会容忍另一个巨人帝国的崛起。",
								"小民们只能猜测巨人动荡的原因。巨人类型之间的旧秩序是否会恢复，或者新的等级制度是否会取代旧的等级制度，将风暴巨人从其崇高的位置上打下来，我们拭目以待。",

								"乌斯加德人讲自己的语言（称为Bothii），没有字母。每个部落都是由几个分散的部族组成，每个部族都有自己的酋长和部落萨满。某一部落的酋长在他们中选择一个人成为部落的大酋长，其权力堪比君主。",
								"Uthgardt野蛮人将他们的死者埋在土坑和土堆下。这些埋葬地点散布在整个北方的偏僻地方。每个Uthgardt部落也有一个对其人民来说很神圣的灵冢。灵冢是部落成员聚集的地方，用来敬仰乌斯加，纪念他们的祖先，向他们的图腾动物精神献祭，并在老酋长死后选择新的大酋长。乌斯加尔人相信，他们的祖先把他们的图腾精神困在这些土丘下，这样他们和他们的后代就可以与精神交流，获得他们的力量。",
								"乌斯加德的野蛮人非常害怕魔法，以至于他们会试图杀死和肢解他们遇到的施法者。部落的巫师不会受到攻击，因为他们的力量来自他们死去的祖先的灵魂。(关于乌斯加特巫师的更多信息，请参见{@adventure appendix C|SKT|16}。",
								"乌斯加德人以狩猎和觅食为生。除了部落中一个明显的例外，他们不建造房屋或永久定居点，更喜欢游牧的生活方式。",

As a result, if the characters visit a settlement while {@creature Harshnag|SKT} is with them, he prefers to remain unseen on the outskirts. The exception is Waterdeep; he considers that city his home and has no qualms about entering it, gently brushing aside guards who stand in his way.",

										"Six mithral-inlaid runes empower the archway. Prying out the mithral or defacing the runes causes the archway's mist to fade away and renders the archway inoperable. The runes are arranged in an arc around the opening, as shown in figure 4.1.",
										"The six runes include a haug (hill) rune, a stein (stone) rune, an ise (frost) rune, an ild (fire) rune, a skye (cloud) rune, and an uvar (storm) rune. The characters have to figure out which rune is which through trial and error, or with the aid of magic such as the {@spell divination} spell. A character who has proficiency in the {@skill Arcana} skill can tell that the runes are magical, but not what the runes mean. {@creature Harshnag|SKT} is familiar with the ise rune and can identify it; the other runes are unknown to him. {@creature Iymrith|SKT}, {@creature Klauth|SKT}, {@creature Claugiyliamatar|SKT}, and most other ancient dragons know all of these runes by name and appearance.",
										"The mist in the archway dimly illuminates the temple. A {@spell detect magic} spell reveals an aura of conjuration magic around the archway, but nothing happens when something enters the mist While the archway is inactive, cold rock wall can be felt beyond the churning mist.",
										"The archway is a portal that connects the temple to the divine oracle (area 11), allowing instantaneous two-way travel once it is activated. To activate the portal, a giant of the hill, stone, frost, fire, cloud, or storm variety (or a creature polymorphed into one of these forms) must take a weapon from one of the statues of the six lesser giant gods and touch it to the appropriate rune on the archway. The wielder must use the weapon belonging to the god that corresponds to the wielder's physical form; for example, {@creature Harshnag|SKT} (a frost giant) can activate the portal only by using Thrym's steel greataxe, and only by touching it to the ise (frost) rune. As soon as the archway activates, the weapon vanishes and reappears in the hands of the statue it came from, unless that statue has been destroyed, in which case the weapon disappears.",
										"Touching a rune with the wrong weapon triggers a spell effect, as described in the Rune Traps table. The effect also occurs when a non-giant touches a rune.",
										"When the portal activates, the glowing mist transforms into churning thunderclouds lit by flashing but harmless lightning, and creatures can see another room (area 11) beyond the clouds. The sound of rolling thunder fills the temple, loud enough to be heard throughout the complex. Any creature that steps into the archway appears in area 11. The archway remains active for 1 hour. Any creature still in area 11 when the archway becomes inactive again is trapped there unless it has some means of escape (such as a {@spell teleport} spell). If the portal closes, it can be reopened from the temple side."

Iron ore is then loaded into buckets and transported to the foundry, where ogres on the gantries (area 18) use long, hooked poles to tip the buckets, causing the ore to fall into the smelters below (area 34). Enormous bellows raise the temperature inside the smelters, melting the iron.

When the wheel is stopped, the force of the current puts tremendous strain on it. At the end of each turn, the wheel has a 25 percent chance of breaking apart and tumbling down the waterfall. If that happens, the millstone and the elevator (area 9) cease to function. Any creature on the wheel when it breaks is swept over the cliff with the wreckage and takes 70 ({@dice 20d6}) bludgeoning damage from the fall. The breaking of the wheel puts the yakfolk village on alert. Meanwhile, Zalto orders one of the fire giants in area 34 to go to area 9, find out what has caused the elevator to stop working, and report back. Unless it encounters trouble along the way, the giant arrives in area 9 roughly 20 minutes after the elevator stops working. If the giant finds evidence of foul play, it reports back to Zalto (taking 20 minutes to reach him). Zalto then places the foundry on alert, meaning that its defenders can't be surprised."

						"{@i Princes of the Apocalypse} is a stand-alone adventure that takes place in and around the Sumber Hills in the Dessarin Valley, a lightly settled region of caravan towns, isolated homesteads, and wilderness. Four evil elemental cults have taken refuge there and are building secret temples in the ruins of a dungeon complex beneath the hills. By the time the characters reach 5th level, they will have visited several settlements in the valley, explored ruins in the Sumber Hills, and defeated a number of low- to middle-rank elemental cultists.",
						"You can transition the characters from {@i Princes of the Apocalypse} to this adventure by having them defend the town of Triboar from a giant attack. In this scenario, Triboar becomes the starting point for this adventure (see chapter 2), and the characters are pulled away from the threat of Elemental Evil to focus on the giant threat instead. Here are a few hooks to lure the characters to Triboar, if they aren't there already.",

You can plan to have them surface when they reach 5th level instead, then segue from {@i Out of the Abyss} to {@i Storm King's Thunder}. Because this adventure takes place in the lands directly above the locations in {@i Out of the Abyss}, you can have the characters surface near one of the three locations in chapter 2.",

Or you can move back and forth between the two adventures, giving players the option of accepting Bruenor's quest to descend into the Underdark before returning to the surface to deal with the giants. In the latter case, it's likely that the characters will be higher level than normal, but you can make the encounters in this adventure more challenging to compensate (see the \"{@book Modifying Encounter Difficulty|DMG|3|Modifying Encounter Difficulty}\" section in chapter 3 of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide})."
