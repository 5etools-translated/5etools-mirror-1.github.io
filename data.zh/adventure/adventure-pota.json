				"一个可怕的威胁在北方集结。在被遗忘的王国的整个地区，野蛮的掠夺者带来了破坏。怪物们在徘徊，捕食羊群，在农田里横冲直撞，袭击家园和旅行者。在定居点，不和谐和猜疑在增长。阴险的陌生人潜伏在阴影中，低声说着一切很快就会改变。今年带来了一个反常的温暖和风暴的春天。洪水、暴风、野火和地震的传说不断传播。",
				"这些麻烦有一个在北方很少有人知道的来源。元素的邪恶。这种邪恶的仆人们聚集在桑伯山，监视着德萨林谷，被一种他们无法解释的力量所吸引。这些狂热者沉迷于危险的传说，试图掌握元素魔法，并在各地释放其破坏性力量。而且他们的计划比北方大多数人意识到的要更进一步。",

						"每当被称为长老元素之眼的力量测试其力量时，元素之恶的威胁就会在多元宇宙的不同世界浮现。在它目前的化身中，元素邪恶出现在桑伯山。这个边境地区分散的城镇和孤立的家园现在面临一个可怕的威胁。如果不能在元素邪恶的力量增长之前将其击败，疯狂和破坏就会在北方肆意蔓延。",
						"邪恶元素在桑伯山的存在可以追溯到几千年前，当时一个叛逆的乌鸦教派发现了桑伯山下的大量洞穴，并声称这是他们的领土。这些黑暗精灵崇尚一种可怕的原始邪恶之神，他们为这种无名的力量建造了一座神殿。随着时间的推移，古老的乌鸦崇拜逐渐消失（或被消灭），这个被称为长老元素之眼神庙的地方被遗忘了几个世纪。",
						"贝西尔默的矮人是下一个发现这个地方的人。贝西尔默是一个牧场和农田的王国。矮人在桑伯山下建立了一个名为Tyar-Besil的地下堡垒，以抵御困扰该地区的巨魔和巨人。矮人在自己的洞穴下发现了古老的鸦人据点和它的神庙。他们缺乏清理废墟的力量，所以他们放弃了更深的挖掘工作。巨魔和巨人很快就打破了贝西尔默的领域，剩下的矮人也完全放弃了这个地方。",
						"多年来，冒险家们偶尔会偶然发现被埋葬的泰尔-贝西尔的据点和它下面的乌鸦金库。很少有人对他们的探索做任何持久的记录，他们的名字也被遗忘。但是在公元893年（使用达勒克宁历法，大约比现在早600年），一队被称为银角骑士的冒险者发现了这个地方，并开始对废墟进行探索。冒险家们一次又一次地回到泰尔-贝西尔，当他们决定建立据点并驯服这片领土时，他们在通往古代矮人遗迹的每个已知的通道上建立了自己的堡垒。冒险家们担心桑伯山下的深洞里有什么东西，他们打算对该地区进行长期监视。",
						"历史并不配合。在银角骑士团建立据点的一两代之后，兽人部落横扫北方，堡垒被攻陷。几个世纪以来，它们一直空着。当地人将其称为 \"闹鬼的堡垒\"，各种怪物偶尔会占据这些废墟。",
						"废弃的堡垒和其下的矮人据点可能已经被永远遗忘了，但几年前，一个名叫维泽兰-德维尔的鸦人回到了古老的眼之窗。DeVir是一个具有强大力量的叛逆的乌鸦巫师，他不是洛尔思的仆人；就像很久以前创建神庙的被遗忘的教派一样，他把自己献给了上古元素之眼的无名力量。他的信仰导致他被流放出鸦人社会，但他对这种黑暗力量的忠诚并没有得到回报。在幻觉的指引下，维泽兰-德维尔创造了四种被元素邪恶所浸染的强大武器：长矛（%0%）、匕首（%1%）、三叉戟（%2%）和战镐（%3%）。他把这些武器留在长老元素之眼的祭坛上，让它们的宿命持有者去发现。",
						"在过去的几个月里，四个元素先知中的每一个都被梦境或幻觉所驱使，去寻找古老的祭坛。一个接一个，{@creature Aerisi Kalinoth|PotA}、{@creature Vanifer|PotA}、{@creature Gar Shatterkeel|PotA}和{@creature Marlos Urnrayle|PotA}认领了他们的武器，并成为他们各自教派的领袖。这四位先知在矮人泰尔-贝西尔的废墟中建立了自己的势力，并占领了守卫通往巨大地宫的鬼堡。疯子、亡命之徒、渴望权力的恶棍和各种类型的怪物开始涌入山谷，被邪恶元素的黑暗召唤所吸引。同时，先知们用他们的新玩具进行实验，培育出的元素节点的种子一天比一天大，并测试他们的力量，创造出越来越大的自然灾害。",

						"冒险开始于人物到达红松镇，一个位于德萨林谷西侧的小定居点。奇怪的传言和不祥的征兆让镇民们忧心忡忡，包括公路上的强盗袭击、德萨林河上的海盗行为以及在镇子附近看到的怪物。但最让该地区敏锐的观察家们担心的谜团是一个从米拉巴尔城到沃特德普的陆路旅行代表团的失踪。该代表团在贝利亚德（Beliard）的小村庄停了下来，成员们在那里提到他们打算在继续前往金矿区之前参观矮人的圣地。他们最后一次被看到是在石桥的西端，转向南方，从陆路穿过桑伯山的中心地带。现在已经过去了将近一个月，代表团从未在金田镇或任何其他前哨出现过。",
						"强大的派别有充分的理由担心代表团的失踪。哈珀人担心一位著名的矮人历史学家，他也是代表团的成员。翡翠飞地想知道代表团成员之一带往金地的一袋魔法种子发生了什么。甚至连Zhentarim也有兴趣通过帮助解开这个谜团来试图改善他们与Mirabar的关系。无论人物是开始寻找失踪的代表团，还是选择调查另一条线索，他们很快就找到了线索，将他们引向桑伯山的闹鬼堡。所有这些地方现在都被奇怪的新教派占据，它们伪装成无害的社团或隐居的命令，但这些前哨站都为元素邪恶服务。",
						"当人物潜入或击败这些伪装的邪教组织时，他们发现每个鬼堡都守卫着一条通道，通往桑伯山下的巨大地牢，即新的元素邪恶神殿。在这里，元素邪教已经在一个古老的矮人据点的废墟中建立了自己的势力。他们在努力掌握元素力量的同时也在积蓄力量。角色们与元素预言家们对峙，并与四个邪教领袖中的一个对抗，他们的身份取决于角色们首先探索神庙的哪个部分。",
						"即使人物深入到元素神庙中，他们的成功也会引起报复。元素预言家们派遣了一批手持（%0%）--基本上是由元素节点产生的元素能量炸弹的邪教徒，在整个德萨林谷释放自然灾害，对人物的干预进行惩罚。",
						"尽管各元素神庙中存在激烈的反对意见，而且被冒犯的邪教也会进行报复，但这些人物还是成功地救出了一些米拉巴尔的代表，并将一些或所有的邪教赶出了他们在泰尔-贝西尔新建立的基地。不幸的是，代表团的其他成员仍然失踪，其他各种线索和谜团仍然没有得到解决。更糟糕的是，很快就可以看出，元素邪教正处于释放不可想象的灾难的边缘。",
						"随着元素启示的日益临近，角色们发现了从Tyar-Besil的邪教控制区通往更古老（也更危险）的洞穴的通道，这些洞穴被称为 \"眼睛之窗\"，是很久以前由鸦人挖掘的。他们在这里找到了供奉长老元素之眼的邪恶祭坛，人物在这里与另一位元素先知对峙（同样，他们与哪位先知战斗取决于他们先探索地牢的哪一部分）。他们还发现了通往邪教终极圣地的通道：被称为黑晶石（Black Geode）、嚎叫洞穴（Howling Caverns）、急流（Plunging Torrents）和哭泣巨人（Weeping Colossus）的元素结点。",
						"在冒险的最后阶段，角色们面临着一项艰巨的任务，那就是追捕剩下的两位元素先知，进入他们的权力之所。四个邪教中最强大、最虔诚的追随者守护着这些圣地，这些圣地被注入了元素能量，并被扭曲成元素界的奇怪反映。在每个元素节点的中心，角色们会发现一个巨大的传送门，作为相关元素界的通道。在这里，剩余的邪教领袖们做出了他们的决定，而在这里，角色们面临着元素邪恶王子们的压倒性力量。面对这样的对手，胜利似乎很值得怀疑，但聪明机智的角色可以找到摧毁传送门的方法，而不是试图杀死这些可怕的生物。",
						"随着传送门的关闭，元素节点恢复正常，任何幸存的邪教徒都四散奔逃。他们的据点被摧毁了，他们的领袖也死了；元素邪恶在这个世界上暂时被打败了。"

						"元素邪恶扭曲了自然元素，将它们限制在破坏的方面。这股力量想要获得拆毁一切的力量--道德、社会结构、政府、自然法则--并将存在降低到一个更原始的状态，沾染上冲突和疯狂。元素邪恶利用凡人的仆人作为实现这一目的的手段。",

						"元素的邪恶出现在不同的世界，贯穿了许多时代。这种邪恶的力量--长老元素之眼--在法鲁恩隐藏得很好。个人仍然容易受到它的召唤：那些被权力的承诺所引诱的人，那些心中只有仇恨的人，那些心灵被破坏的人，因此对暗示和黑暗的低语开放。这些人是元素邪恶的仆人，如果他们不被揭露和根除，他们会造成不可估量的伤害。",
						"虽然毁灭是元素邪恶的统一原则，但为这种黑暗力量服务的生命不一定坚持这一目标。只有最不平衡的头脑才会为了毁灭而寻求毁灭。相反，元素邪恶的仆人们通过空气、地球、火或水等元素之一的破坏力来寻求力量。这就是四个元素邪教的起源，它们共同构成了对元素邪教的崇拜。",
						"这些邪教相互独立运作。每个人都相信自己喜欢的元素是最强大的，最值得崇拜的。空气邪教的普通成员对任何人都能在土、火或水元素中看到值得崇拜的东西的想法嗤之以鼻。其他邪教的成员对任何邪教都有同样的感觉，除了他们自己的。只有受过最好教育或最有魔法天赋的成员才明白，每个元素邪教都有一个统一的原则。即使如此，他们也认为他们的元素应该是至高无上的。",
						"尽管有这些不同的目标和不同的方法，元素邪教被他们不完全理解的力量联系在一起。从一个世界到另一个世界，从一个时代到另一个时代，元素邪恶的邪教一次又一次地兴起。每一次，空气、地球、火和水元素的崇拜者都会加入到同一个黑暗命运中。",

				"如果说德萨林谷不像以前那样野蛮和无法无天，它仍然是轻度定居的领土，是通往远方的通道。红落叶松或特里波尔等地的居民吹嘘说，他们简陋的定居点是 \"通往北方的门户\"。每年有数以百计的商队和龙骨船通过这些土地，将水底城和永夜城的大港口与埃弗隆德、米拉巴尔或银月城等地连接起来。稳定的商队交通为这一地区的城镇注入了活力，支持了长路沿线定居点的商业。旅店迎合了那些急于在坚固的墙内安全入睡的旅行者，在温暖的火堆旁享受美食，而不是在路边露营。",
				"除了满足前往或来自遥远的北方的商队和旅行者的需求外，德萨林谷还是沃特德普和永冬的饥饿人口的粮仓。该地区的农场和牧场生产谷物、牲畜、家禽、苹果和啤酒花，然后将它们顺流而下（或沿长路行驶）运往海岸。很少有人靠种地致富，但只要天气好，该地区的农民就能过上好日子。(这就是为什么最近的异常天气令人担忧的原因之一）。",

Appropriate backgrounds for earth genasi include hermit, outlander, and soldier.",

Likely backgrounds for a fire genasi include criminal, folk hero, and noble.",

Like earth genasi, though, water genasi prefer quiet and solitude; the wide shores are their natural homes. They go where they want, do what they want, and rarely feel bound to anything. Good backgrounds for water genasi include hermit and sailor."

The Crushing Wave cultists occupying the old keep aren't smugglers and pirates; they're slave traders.",

Kled is a good base for explorations, and can serve as the \"Red Larch\" of a Dark Sun Elemental Evil campaign. Freedom is a good counterpart for Beliard, and Silver Spring works well in the role of Bargewright Inn and Womford.

Elemental priests hold a social position similar to that of religious hermits or tribal shamans of other worlds. Common Athasians, especially those who live outside the walls of the city-states, revere elemental priests and listen carefully when they speak. The chief difference between cultists dedicated to Elemental Evil and the elemental priests normally found in the tribes and villages of Athas is the cult's dedication to evil. An elemental priest protects and guides the common people, using elemental magic to better their lives. An elemental cultist demands abasement, sacrifice, and obedience. The element is no longer a tool of survival; it is a force for destruction and the power to dominate others.",

In small desert villages, a cult could easily take shape and even attract popular support from a local community or tribe—at least until the cruelty and madness of its adherents make its true nature obvious to all.",

The elemental weapons are heirlooms or lost treasures created long ago during an earlier incarnation of the cult.
