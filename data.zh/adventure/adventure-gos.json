				"萨尔马什是一个不起眼的渔村，隐藏在基奥兰王国的南部海岸。几代人以来，Keoland是一个强大的军事力量。它优秀的骑兵和勇敢的骑士将王国的边界向北、向西、向东推进。每一次成功的战役都增加了王室的财富和权力，而每一次战役又将王国的注意力吸引到更远的北方。Keoland的南部沿海地区仍然是一个落后的地方。",
				"王室的善意忽视使海盗和强盗行为得以猖獗。萨尔马什和类似的城镇一直在捕鱼，满足于保持低调，避免政府的纠缠。几十年前，在萨尔马什附近水域游荡的海盗们逐渐强大到足以创建自己的王国，一个松散的联盟，被称为 \"海王子之家\"。随着这个国家的崛起，对萨尔马什和其邻国的袭击也越来越多。海王子们的袭击船在海岸上掠夺更多的奴隶，以支持他们不断增长的王国，萨尔特马什遭受了严重的损失。那个时代的记忆深深地笼罩着这个地区，当地人对海王子的恨意也很深。",
				"随着时间的推移，Keoland在北方的胜利让位于一连串的失败，它的邻国将王国逼回了它原来的边界。随着世界的逼近，国王金伯托斯-斯科蒂向南方看去，看到了不受控制的强盗行为和一个崛起的海盗国家。王室与北方的前敌人签订了和平条约，组建了海军，并对海王子的野心进行了猛烈的打击，但冲突还没有结束。",
				"斯科蒂国王已经下令，必须镇压海盗，确保海上通道的安全，并培育贸易。如果基奥兰不能作为一支军事力量而繁荣，它就必须作为一个贸易中心而变得更加强大。",
				"萨尔马什，尽管它可能远离Keoland的权力中心，但随着对国王计划的反应，它的生活正进入一个新阶段。国王的代理人想扩大村庄的港口，使其成为与世界其他地方进行贸易的主要地点。在另一个最近的发展中，一队矮人--带着国王本人的命令--已经到达，并开始挖掘城镇附近的山丘和海边的悬崖，寻找贵重金属。如果他们的工作如期取得成果，该矿将成为该村--实际上是整个地区繁荣的一个主要因素。",
				"自然，并不是所有Saltmarsh的居民都对他们社区内和周围的最新发展有同样的感受，这也是影响他们生活和生计的关键问题。虽然最近的变化站在为该地区带来新的繁荣，但许多当地人并不希望看到他们的家园被改变。同时，作为贯穿所有事件的暗流，秘密和神秘的血色兄弟会的代理人努力挫败基奥兰的野心，同时推进他们自己的野心。",

						"The merchant prince Aubreck Drallion once counted himself among the richest folk of his city. His trade fleet was one of the largest and most prosperous of its kind, with hundreds of ships under his banner dodging storms, pirate raids, and aquatic monsters to carry goods across the world.",
						"Yet Aubreck's success perhaps came too fast and too easily; although his profits eventually stabilized, his ambition kept expanding. Years ago, his contacts in the southern jungles reported that he could monopolize trade in rare spices and herbs by making heavy investments in the area. Aubreck took the opportunity as a sure thing and leaped at the chance to get even richer. He sold off many of his assets and converted the proceeds to property deeds and promissory notes, then secured that portable wealth aboard {@i Emperor of the Waves}, the foremost ship in his fleet.",
						"Aubreck's plan was to convert these notes back into cash when the ship reached its destination in the south, but fate introduced a cruel twist, and {@i Emperor of the Waves} disappeared. A storm separated the ship from its escort, and it was never heard from again. Devastated by the financial loss, Aubreck was reduced to the lifestyle of an ordinary merchant.",
						"The true fate of {@i Emperor of the Waves} is known only to a few. The ship was nearly sunk in the storm that drove it off course, but it remained seaworthy. After the storm subsided, its surviving crew members dropped anchor near an uncharted island. When they came ashore to look for food and water, they discovered the island was inhabited by tribes of primitive humans, orcs, and goblins, ruled by cruel druids who worshiped Lolth in her aspect as the Queen of Spiders. The druids promptly had the few remaining sailors dispatched by their underlings and claimed the ship as a sign of favor from their dark goddess.",
						"In time, the island's population became fractured into two factions, each of which tried to exterminate the other. One group claimed custody of the ship and used it as a headquarters, stocking it with supplies and defending it from assaults by the enemy group. When the war entered its final throes, the ship was in danger of being overrun by the land-based forces. In response, rather than staying and fighting it out, the cultists aboard the ship pulled up anchor—and thanks to an offshore wind, they rode the waves and left the island far behind.",
						"Fifteen days ago, Aubreck received word that {@i Emperor of the Waves} had been spotted adrift in the southern sea, apparently a ghost ship. The noble promptly used a sizable chunk of his savings to hire a ship and crew to sail to the derelict. Aubreck believes he can restore his standing if he recovers the deeds and documents that sailed with the ship. Now, all he needs are a few brave souls able to deal with whatever threats might present themselves aboard the {@i Emperor} and bring back his fortune."

						"{@i Salvage Operation} starts as an investigation adventure, in which the characters board {@i Emperor of the Waves} and explore its upper decks. As they venture into the ship's lower decks, this scenario becomes more of a dungeon crawl in cramped, dangerous spaces, with vermin attacking in close quarters. Characters who survive those threats and push on find the lowest holds flooded with seawater and infested with undead.",
						"As the characters fight their way forward in search of Aubreck's goal, the perils of the sea finally take their delayed claim on the {@i Emperor}, in the form of a hungry elder octopus. This creature first assaulted the ship several days before the characters arrive. Its previous rampage failed to scuttle the ship, though the octopus succeeded in devouring or drowning almost all of its living occupants.",
						"To say that the {@i Emperor} now has a skeleton crew would be an overstatement. Of all the cultists who escaped the island, only a single evil druid remains alive aboard ship. The half-orc {@creature Krell Grohlg|GoS} still practices his worship of Lolth at a shrine inside the ship and is aided in his defense of the vessel by various kinds of spiders, swarms of vermin, and other monstrosities.",
						"The climax of the adventure is a race against time as the octopus returns for a final onslaught, with decks flooding, the ship sinking, and characters scrambling through the disintegrating hull in a race for their lives. If Krell or his minions are still alive, they present an additional obstacle because they also don't want to go down with the ship.",

He offers the characters a fee of 10 percent (10,000 gp) to recover it. As a gesture of good faith, he offers them an advance payment of 200 gp.

He says that the ship was recently spotted adrift, approximately five days out from land.",

The crate can easily be pried or broken open, but the box can't be opened except with a password known only to Aubreck. It contains all of Aubreck's deeds and promissory notes, still sealed in waterproof wrappings. The notes are drawn from a lawful good temple that will pay them out only after the original owner of the assets gives permission, and their value will enable Aubreck to rebuild his business once he redeems them for himself.",

After doing so, the characters learn of the island's history and how it connects to the undead attacks. They then have a chance to destroy the underwater source of evil—the twisted undead captain Syrgaul. Seeking the undead in his watery lair, they discover the damaged magical seal that once kept the portal inside the Pit of Hatred closed. Only by resealing the rift can they end its corruption for good.",

As it read the minds of its victims as it devoured them, some of what it gleaned of Tharizdun—between their screams and their unheeded pleas for mercy—found purchase in Sgothgah's mind. For centuries, the aboleth mulled over the concept of Tharizdun in idle moments, and eventually those thoughts flowered into something alien and repulsive to most aboleths: religious faith.",

								"To hide its burgeoning devotion to a non-abolethic entity from the prying telepathic abilities of its kind, Sgothgah relocated its lair to the edge of the Endless Nadir. There, in the solitude of the inky deep, the aboleth made a second astounding discovery: a juvenile kraken with an unlikely, circular scar on its head, a wound earned in battle against a giant shark years ago. Even such a strange scar would normally be little more than a curiosity, but Sgothgah saw a pattern in this one that evoked thoughts of Tharizdun's dark madness. The aboleth took this event as a sign that Tharizdun had gifted it with the task of nurturing the kraken until it was fully grown.",
								"Sgothgah knew the kraken could never be raised to maturity in the Endless Nadir—even in Sgothgah's remote corner of it—without risking discovery by the other aboleths. So Sgothgah fled the abyss, taking with it the juvenile kraken and a number of loyal aquatic minions. It headed for coastal waters that the aboleths avoided because of the humanoids that dwelled there, trusting that other aboleths wouldn't follow it or even care that it had left.",
								"Purely by chance, the oceanic immigrants came to a stretch of water where the once-notable port district of a minor city had fallen into decay and corruption. Known as the Styes, the district was only a wretched shadow of what it had once been. But the aboleth found a perfect location to hide the kraken—a sunken temple to the west of the district, known to the locals as Landgrave's Folly. Sgothgah quickly established mind control over a local cadre of fishers and sailors, sending them to infiltrate every corner of the ruined district. And to the aboleth's surprise and unnatural delight, it discovered an active cult of Tharizdun in the Styes.",
								"Led secretly by one of the Styes' own ruling councillors—an inhuman creature that calls itself \"{@creature Mr. Dory|GoS}\"—this cult of Tharizdun has thrived in the decay of the Styes for decades. Through enslavement and telepathy, Sgothgah forged an alliance with the cultists, always taking care to conceal its true identity. The cultists knew Sgothgah only as \"the Whisperer,\" and they quickly came to regard their hidden ally as a powerful messenger of Tharizdun. To this day, only {@creature Mr. Dory|GoS} suspects the truth."

								"To feed the growing kraken's ravenous hunger, Sgothgah has coerced its cultist allies into supplying the beast with beggars, drunks, urchins, and other sweepings from the alleys of the Styes that no one will miss. At the same time, the aboleth transformed the underwater pit where the kraken rests into a conduit for dark magic, fashioned to capture the plentiful negative emotions of the residents of the Styes. For months now, all their fear, sadness, despair, hatred, and anger has been focused into the pit to enhance and accelerate the kraken's growth.",
								"To maximize the effect of that emotional darkness, the aboleth chose a local human fisher named Jarme Loveage to be an instrument of murder and fear. Sgothgah enslaved the young man and has compelled him to commit brutal murders, fueling dread in the district. Jarme carries a lantern on all his grisly nocturnal harvests, and his horrible work has long been attributed to a faceless terror called \"the Lantern Ghost.\"",
								"As the killings mounted, residents of the Styes grew increasingly frightened. Jarme retained little knowledge of his foul work. He awoke exhausted, haunted by vague memories of horrible nightmares, but hasn't connected the vague horrors of his sleep with the very real horror occurring in the shadowy, mist-drenched alleys of his home.",
								"Seven days ago, Jarme was captured by a nighttime patrol with a bloody knife in his hands. The confused fisher professed his innocence, but his dreams became suddenly clear. In his mind, he saw ravenous, tentacled creatures devouring the Styes and the city beyond, and he scrawled these images onto the walls of his cell in the asylum where he spent his last days. Not even the pleas of his sister and a local priest named {@creature Master Refrum|GoS|Refrum} were enough to save him. Only yesterday, Jarme Loveage dangled from the executioner's noose.",
								"With Jarme's death, the Styes breathed a collective sigh of relief—but that relief is destined to be short-lived. The kraken is nearing maturity, and the Whisperer is preparing the final stage of its dreadful plan."

Making the Styes part of a larger, thriving settlement gives the characters plenty of potential reasons to visit the area, with the overall settlement ideally located in a nation that's fallen on hard times. Alternatively, the district could be part of a free city that has fallen into despair and decay. In the world of Greyhawk, the city of Prymp in Ahlissa is an excellent choice. In the Forgotten Realms, the Styes fits nicely into the city of Marsember. In Eberron, the Styes could be a district in Rekkenmark or any of the other coastal settlements that haven't fully recovered from the ravages of the Last War.",

They can't retreat to a nicer part of the city when they want a clean inn, a healthy place to eat, or a wholesome temple for healing or other aid. As a stand-alone town, the Styes can be added to your campaign world at the mouth of any river.

New people called the district home: poor, desperate folk crowded beneath fallen gables in hovels tattooed by mildew and damp rot. On their heels came folk whose trade was scorned elsewhere. Alchemists fouled the air and water with poisonous concoctions from failed experiments. Sweat-shop manufactories set up in the Styes and all but enslaved their desperate workers.

Applying fire to the wound before the end of the host creature's next turn deals 1 fire damage to the host and kills the infesting rot grub. After this time, the rot grub is too far under the host creature's skin to be burned. If a creature infested by one or more rot grubs ends its turn with 0 hit points, it dies as the grubs burrow into its heart and kill it.
