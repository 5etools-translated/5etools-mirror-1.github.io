Liara is 47 years old and has held her post for the past three years. To her, a posting in Chult feels like a test of mettle, but to many of her subordinates, it feels like banishment. The garrison consists of a castellan named Gruta Halsdottir (LN female Illuskan human {@creature knight}), three corporals ({@creature Veteran||veterans}), and fifty-four privates ({@creature Guard||guards}). The garrison operates in three eight-hour shifts, with one {@creature Veteran||corporal} (gauntlet) and eighteen {@creature Guard||privates} (fists) on duty during each shift.",

Because of their arrangement, the pirates agreed to Portyr's demand that they never attack ships flying the flag of Baldur's Gate. Liara receives a cut of the pirate's profits, some of which goes toward paying bonuses to her garrison to keep the soldiers happy.",
								"Although she's a villain of sorts, {@creature Liara Portyr|ToA} has no reason to be an enemy to the characters. She spends most of her time managing the security of her stronghold, going over field reports, and sifting through reports from her spies in Port Nyanzaru. She admires adventurers, and as long as the characters do nothing to antagonize her, she can provide them with useful advice and material aid against the myriad threats lurking in the jungle.",
								"Liara is puzzled by reports coming from her patrols to the south. They've crossed the trails of large creatures in the jungle that don't match anything known to live in Chult. If the characters are planning to explore the region between the east coast and the River Tiryki, or they've already been there and seen anything unusual, she'd be grateful for any light they can shed on the mystery. (Her patrols are seeing signs of the frost giants searching for {@creature Artus Cimber|ToA}.)",

The Emerald Enclave has expert guides stationed here as well. One of them, a druid named {@creature Qawasha|ToA} (see \"{@adventure Finding a Guide|ToA|1|Qawasha and Kupalué}\"), comes highly recommended.",
								"The main reason adventurers have for visiting Fort Beluarian is to buy a \"charter of exploration.\" Baldur's Gate lays claim to everything east of the Mistcliff and north of Kitcher's Inlet, and now that Mezro is picked clean, it's trying to extend its claim south to Refuge Bay. No one (including the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru) has the force in Chult to dispute this claim. So within its territory, the Flaming Fist does as it pleases, including demanding that explorers buy charters. A charter grants permission to the holder to explore Chult and plunder its riches, but half of an expedition's proceeds and discoveries must be turned over to the Flaming Fist. The charter costs 50 gp, which is treated as a down payment on the split of profits. In addition, those who buy a charter can hire up to six Flaming Fist mercenaries ({@creature Guard||guards}) to accompany them for the very reasonable rate of 1 gp per tenday each. It's easy enough to launch an expedition from Port Nyanzaru without a charter. The only risk is that if a Flaming Fist patrol runs into an expedition without a charter, it will attack the expedition and confiscate its gear.",

Ships anchor a half-mile offshore, and people and supplies are ferried back and forth on rowboats. Six Flaming Fist {@creature Guard||guards} defend this station; their chief duty is rowing the boats back and forth. In case of danger, they can barricade themselves inside the stoutest log building or row out to sea until whatever threatens them loses interest and wanders away.",

Ka-Nanji was a palatial retreat from the intrigues and pressures of Omu, and the beautiful, tiered garden was praised as a worthy tribute to the queen.",

						"While the characters are exploring or camping in the wilderness, roll a d20 three times per day of game time, checking for encounters each morning, afternoon, and evening or night. An encounter occurs on a roll of 16 or higher. Roll percentile dice and check the Wilderness Encounters table for the terrain appropriate to where the characters are. After determining what the characters encounter, you can use the information presented later in this appendix to bring the encounter to life.",
						"The maps of Chult have regions marked as undead territory (lesser or greater). The Wilderness Encounters table has separate columns you should use when determining encounters in these undead-infested regions, or in regions with no undead.",
						"If your players tire of random encounters, make such encounters less common by having them occur on a roll of 18 or higher, or only 20. You can also let the players narrate their way through avoiding easy encounters, or you can increase the difficulty of easy encounters to keep them exciting. One way to make an encounter more challenging is to have it trigger a second random encounter. For example, a fight with goblins might attract a nearby pack of ghouls or dinosaurs. You can also shorten encounters by having monsters flee when they lose the tactical advantage or most of their hit points.",
						"Random encounters aren't tailored to characters of a particular level. If the characters encounter hostile creatures beyond their ability to defeat, give them opportunities to run, hide, negotiate, or otherwise avoid certain death. You can also have other creatures arrive and provide a distraction that the characters can use to make their escape. For example, if a character needs to make a crucial ability check or saving throw, you can have a {@creature chwinga|ToA} appear, cast {@spell guidance} or {@spell resistance} on the character, and then disappear on its next turn.",

If crushed or struck, a zabou releases its spores in a 10-foot-radius sphere. A zabou can also be hurled up to 30 feet away or dropped like a grenade, releasing its cloud of spores on impact. Any creature in that area must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. The poisoned creature's skin itches for the duration. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success."
