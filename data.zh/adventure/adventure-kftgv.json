						"Froderic Dartwild—Frody to those who knew him well—was a gifted human bard born and raised in the hamlet of Toadhop. He could play the mandolin by age three and performed regularly at Toadhop's local tavern until his eighteenth year, when he left this bucolic backwater and became an adventurer. But his adventuring exploits paled in comparison to his reputation as a performer. So gifted a musician was he that an admiring wizard gave Frody an {@item Instrument of the Bards, Canaith Mandolin||instrument of the bards}—a famous Canaith mandolin called Golden Axe. The mandolin's magic served Frody well during his many adventures but wasn't enough to save his life. On a crisp autumn day, Frody and his companions were beset by manticores on a lonely stretch of road, and Frody was killed by a manticore's tail spike.",
						"Frody's body was returned to Toadhop and laid to rest in the earth next to his mother, Veena, and his sister, Marigold. Golden Axe was buried with him. Shortly after Frody was interred, a tiefling named {@creature Sythian Skalderang|KftGV}, who lived many miles away, learned of the famous bard's untimely death.",
						"Sythian had inherited his parents' estate and debts, but a mysterious poison killed off the family's olive orchard, leaving him with nothing but the mansion and its furnishings. Those furnishings included a multitude of musical instruments Sythian's parents had bought in the hopes of making him a musical prodigy. While he excelled at none of the instruments, he realized he could pay off his family's debts by turning his home into a conservatory for young musicians from wealthy families. One of his current students, Wylie van Timmel, shows great promise. Sythian hatched a plan to snatch Golden Axe from Frody's grave and give it to Wylie as a present, hoping to earn the favor and long-term financial support of her wealthy family.",
						"Sythian hired a pair of halflings named Mackerel Mudbottom and Trout Bonanza to dig up Frody's remains and pry the Canaith mandolin from his hands. They did just that, leaving behind an open grave. After the halflings fled with the mandolin, Frody awakened, crawled from his coffin, shambled to his mother's old cabin, and knocked on the door. The young family living there fled in terror at the sight of him and took shelter in a neighbor's barn. The good folks of Toadhop have been on edge ever since.",
						"The characters arrive in Toadhop and quickly discover that someone has disturbed the grave of a famous bard named Froderic Dartwild and that Frody's corpse is \"none too happy about it.\" Locals ask the characters to speak with Frody, who is holed up in a cabin on the outskirts of the hamlet. From Frody's zombified corpse, the characters learn that the stolen mandolin is called Golden Axe. They also learn the identities of the grave robbers who stole the mandolin, as Frody's restless spirit heard the halflings refer to each other by name before they inadvertently animated his corpse. Frody refuses to return to his grave until the mandolin is returned to him.",
						"If the characters agree to retrieve the mandolin, they find Mackerel and Trout at their riverside abode, five miles from Toadhop. The two halflings reveal that their employer, {@creature Sythian Skalderang|KftGV}, has Golden Axe in his possession and plans to give it to one of his students. Stealing Golden Axe from Skalderang Conservatory forms the crux of this adventure. Ideally, at least one character in the party should be a bard.",

The elite thieves of this multinational organization pull off impossible heists, targeting crown jewels, national secrets, and other heavily guarded prizes. Decades ago, the elf Nixylanna Vidorant joined the Silver Fingers, where she partnered with a dwarf named Samphith Goldenbeard. These friendly rivals made a good pair. Vidorant was skilled with picking locks and deftly getting into tough places, and Goldenbeard used his connections and quick thinking to research targets and talk the pair's way out of trouble.",

The heist seemed like any other—until thirty guards suddenly surrounded the pair of thieves. Vidorant nimbly escaped via the roof with the diadem in hand, but Goldenbeard was caught. He avoided imprisonment by calling in favors with powerful friends, but when he tracked down Vidorant, she refused to hand over the diadem despite his family's claim to it.",

Whatever the truth, she kept the diadem, the once-friendly rivalry turned bitter, and the two have tried to outmaneuver each other ever since.",
						"Recently, their uneasy relationship changed again with the death of the longtime leader of the Silver Fingers Society. Vidorant and Goldenbeard each competed to win leadership of the society, calling in favors from every ally they had in the organization. Unfortunately for Vidorant, Goldenbeard proved defter at internal politics, winning leadership of the society—and getting Vidorant expelled in the process. Goldenbeard promised harsh retaliation against anyone who helped Vidorant, ensuring none of her former allies would stand against him.",
						"Weeks after his takeover of the Silver Fingers Society, Goldenbeard made an even bigger move against Vidorant. He promised a favor to any existing or aspiring Silver Finger who steals the Ruby Diadem of Erlynn Blessedore and delivers it to him. This challenge is the talk of scoundrel circles as everyone vies to steal the diadem from Vidorant. Doing so won't be easy, as Vidorant keeps her treasures in her secure vault on the outskirts of the city."

						"Two decades ago, an elf archivist named Rilago found crumbling journals and architectural plans in his family's ancestral library that mentioned a tomb beneath Oztocan. The town's mayor refused to allow Rilago to mount an excavation, but the mayor's daughter, Aminta, overheard their conversation and became obsessed with finding the tomb.",
						"Years later, the mayor passed away and his son, Tavio, was elected to replace him. Aminta, who had become involved with the Onyx Scar crime syndicate, persuaded Rilago to join her search for the tomb and convinced Tavio to overlook their endeavor. Aminta and Rilago found the tomb and Xeluan's petrified remains, but no treasure. Disappointed, they tried to profit by shattering the giant's body, only to find it indestructible.",
						"One day, as Rilago climbed on the scaffolding surrounding Xeluan, he punched the giant's stone chest in frustration. It unexpectedly cracked open, revealing a heart of obsidian. A single shard broke off from the heart, impaling and killing Rilago.",
						"Unbeknownst to everyone involved, Rilago was descended from one of the ancient heroes Xeluan died to protect. One of Rilago's rings was a family heirloom from that ancestor. When he punched the giant with that ring, he literally and symbolically broke Xeluan's heart, weakening the magic that protects the giant's corpse.",

This material, called \"oztocanite,\" can be worked into precious gemstones or used to empower spells (see {@area area X4|381|x}). The sale of oztocanite has become a profitable enterprise for Aminta and has increased her status in the Onyx Scar."

Governing from Castle Cinis, Jhaeros was advised by two councilors, Regine LaVerne and {@creature Charmayne Daymore|KftGV}, and a guard captain named Naevys Tharesso. Jhaeros's rule was compassionate, just, and kind. Over the last year, however, Naevys watched with growing concern as Jhaeros became more withdrawn and secretive, closing Ghalasine to trade and failing to honor his alliances.",
						"A powerful spellcaster, Charmayne had become jealous of the king's passion and warmth. Longing to possess those qualities, she painstakingly created rituals to drain Jhaeros's vitality and charm, and to funnel these qualities into herself. However, the magic only enhanced her greed and jealousy; the more she took from Jhaeros, the hungrier for power Charmayne became, going so far as to murder her fellow councilor, Regine, while she slept.",

With the help of {@spell scrying} spells, the mages gleaned the truth and revealed Charmayne's treachery to Naevys. The loyal captain returned to Ghalasine at once but found herself unable to enter the city. Charmayne had anticipated Naevys's return and prepared accordingly by invoking a powerful ward that prevents anyone born in Ghalasine from entering or leaving the city.",
						"As she came to realize the people of Ghalasine didn't love her as they did the king, Charmayne became filled with rage. She used magic to tear out Jhaeros's heart while keeping it alive. She then used the still-beating heart as the focus of a ritual to destroy Ghalasine. A spherical void appeared in the sky above Castle Cinis, causing the city to slowly turn to ash and drawing the souls of the dead into it. The longer the void persists, the more quickly the city deteriorates.",
