His faction allies fitted him with a stylish and functional arcane prosthetic, but this brush with death has made him short-tempered, cautious, and mistrustful. Irvan fears that any further mistake could cost him his life—permanently.",

She continues the mission out of love for Ayo, but she fears that her leader's determination might not be enough to achieve victory. Maggie doesn't trust the Allegiance of Allsight agents in Cael Morrow (even if the rivals have allied with that faction), believing them to be influenced by a malevolent force.
