						"一年前，由一个名叫Caerhan Coalsmith的矮人带领的一群冒险家发现了一个埋在废塔遗迹中的奇怪物体。这个遗物似乎是一个金色的口轮外壳，缺少了齿轮式的发条部件。这显然是某种魔法物品，但奥术理论并不是这个团队的强项，所以在卡伊尔汗调查它的来源和历史时，这个口簧被放在一边。",
						"矮人听说过一些关于符合遗物描述的设备的故事。虽然他从未了解过它的全部力量，但有传言说，如果收集到一个魔法饰品的缺失部件并将其放入其中，这些力量就会增强。不幸的是，凯尔汉也从来没有了解过魔戒所携带的诅咒--他的队伍付出了代价。",

						"悲痛欲绝的卡恩决定必须毁掉这个遗物，但他认识到这是黑暗力量的源泉，为时已晚。然而，它的神器级魔法使它似乎不受伤害。在Caerhan的妖精伙伴Gorkoh的帮助下，进行了更多的研究。最后，凯尔汉得出结论，确保神器终结的最佳地点是沃特迪普地下的一个秘密的毁灭神殿，据传它甚至能摧毁强大的魔法遗迹。于是两人收拾行装，前往辉煌之城。",
						"这位资深的矮人冒险家很容易就找到了通往神殿的地下通道。他和Gorkoh勇敢地走过这些危险的通道，但在遇到腐肉爬行者时被分开了。Caerhan继续前进。但当他启动神殿时，他引起了一场小地震，在沃特迪普的码头区打开了一个天坑，并使整个城市的墙壁和人行道开裂。最后，即使对于神龛的破坏力来说，箭塔的外壳也太强大了，卡伊尔汗在他为世界摆脱危险装置的英勇尝试中死去。现在，这个神器正等待着别人来拥有它。",
						"正如主人公将及时了解到的那样，这个金字塔和它的组成部分在很久以前就被有意地分散了。但是金字塔的碎片保持着一种联系，多年来一直在稳定地走向彼此。其中一块由位于格雷皮亚克山脉的神器创造者永久持有，其他部件和神器外壳最终散落在整个剑海岸，落入不同的冒险团体手中。其中一个团体是被称为 \"六人帮 \"的邪恶派别，他们的成员已经意识到了箭塔的存在--并且完全了解其潜在的破坏性力量。这股力量在{@book appendix D|AI|6}中的口诀中有所描述。",
						"当这些人物被吸引去接触神器时，他们发现神器的两个部件已经被收购公司的特许经营权认领，而这些特许经营权最近遭到了未知敌人的攻击。德兰企业的敌对派别成为主要嫌疑人，它的代理人被发现在两次袭击的现场。与此同时，\"六人帮 \"的阴暗成员还策划了一个纠缠不清的阴谋，以获得对神器的控制权，从而摧毁收购公司--为法鲁恩带来毁灭。",

						"The Wedding Itinerary table provides an overview of the day's events, which are part of your recipe for hilarity and disaster. At the appointed times, guests move from one location to another and begin a specific event. If an NPC has a secret, it activates during the appropriate event. Take the player of an NPC aside and inform them of their secret goal, and explain that the importance of the goal to the body they inhabit means that they are compelled to try to accomplish this goal. Players can share their secret goal with other individual players once they learn it, as long as sharing it would not contradict that goal. For example, the player running Gwendolyn should not share their goal with the player running Tannus, because the whole point is for Gwendolyn to surprise her new husband with the gift. Likewise, the player running Rala does not share her goal with anyone having an interest in what's in the vaults.",
						"In any free time between events, or by sneaking away from events, the characters can try to realize their primary goal of finding the final orrery component. The time of each event in the itinerary is known to all members of the caravan, so the characters can plan when to perform their heist. Of course, the secret goals of the wedding guests might impact those plans.",
						"Unlike a typical dungeon infiltration, the layout of the enclave is not as important as the itinerary. Players are not expected to turn this into a dungeon crawl, if only because Horn Enclave is teeming with guards and other dwarves. Any wedding guests seen in private chambers or away from the events of the wedding itinerary are given a warning the first time, then questioned more carefully and searched each time thereafter. Evidence of theft or other lawbreaking could result in a guest being supervised by a guard until the caravan departs.",
						"If the dwarves of Horn Enclave somehow find out that the characters are members of Acquisitions Incorporated, permanent incarceration or execution are among the best possible outcomes. Ideally, the players coming up with hilarious ways to escape will allow them to prevent such fates. Even if the characters have not used Flabbergast's ritual, it should be clear to them that paying attention to the wedding's schedule makes it easier to find times when they can more easily reach the vaults.",
