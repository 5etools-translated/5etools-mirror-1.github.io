					"page": 4,
					"id": "002",
					"entries": [
						"什么是Eberron？以下是需要了解的关键事项。",
						"{@b 1. The Last War Has Ended—Sort Of}. 一个多世纪前，最后一次战争使霍尔韦尔大陆陷入内战，使组成加利法尔王国的五个国家支离破碎。就在两年前，战争结束了，签署了《王权条约》，建立了12个公认的国家和脆弱的和平。然而，长期战争的冲突、愤怒和痛苦依然存在，新的国家在为大陆上爆发的下一场战争做准备时寻求一切优势。",
						"{@b 2. Dragonmarked Dynasties}. 伟大的龙纹家族是整个Khorvaire及其他地区的工业和商业男爵。他们的影响力超越了政治边界，在最后的战争中他们大多保持中立。严格来说，他们并不是任何国家的公民，每个家族的族长和元老都在他们位于霍尔韦尔各地的飞地和商场里过着辉煌的生活。这些商业王朝的权力来自于龙纹--遗传性的奥术符号，这些符号体现在家族中的某些人身上，赋予他们与每个家族控制的贸易行会相关的有限但有用的魔法能力。",
						"{@b 3. Lands of Intrigue}. 战争结束了，Khorvaire的国家现在试图建立一个和平和繁荣的新时代。然而，古老的威胁仍然存在，世界需要英雄们来承担起这个责任。各个国家在许多层面上竞争，包括经济主导地位、政治影响、领土、魔法力量等等，每个国家都希望通过任何手段来维持或提高自己的地位，而不是通过全面战争。龙纹屋、纯洁和腐败的教会、犯罪首脑、怪物帮派、幻术间谍、奥术大学、秘密社团、阴险的主谋、龙，以及众多组织和派别都加入了最后战争后的地位和权力争夺战中。",
						"{@b 4. A Continent of Adventure}. 从Q'barra的丛林到恶魔荒原的爆炸山丘和山谷，从Sharn的摩天大楼到充满恐龙的Talenta平原，Eberron是一个冒险的世界。冒险可以把英雄们从一个异国情调的地方吸引到霍尔韦尔大陆上的另一个地方。对第七月之镜的探索可能会把英雄们从达尔古恩的一个隐秘的山间神殿带到阴影地带的一个破败的城堡，最后到科兰伯格图书馆下面的一个地牢。通过使用魔法运输工具，英雄们可以在冒险过程中到达广泛的环境，从而应对各种各样的怪物和其他挑战。",
						"{@b 5. A World of Magic}. Eberron的技术不是通过科学的进步而是通过对魔法的掌握而发展起来的。魔法的广泛使用充斥着城市和城镇的生活。飞船和铁路运输使跨越大陆的快速旅行成为可能。一个由小法师组成的工作阶层，被称为魔法师，利用法术提供能源和其他必需品。魔法物品创造的进步导致了从自走式农具到在工匠的锻造中创造的有知觉的、自由意志的生命的一切。在被称为龙石的稀有水晶的帮助下，龙印可以变得更加强大，元素可以被控制和驾驭，魔法物品也可以被制作和塑形。",
						"{@b 6. New Races}. 除了{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中常见的玩家角色种族外，玩家可以选择在Eberron中扮演兽人或哥布林人角色。或者他们可以从四个新种族中选择一个。{@race changeling|ERLW|changelings}, {@race kalashtar|ERLW}, {@race shifter|ERLW|shifters}, 和 {@race warforged|ERLW}。变身者拥有类似于二重身的轻微变身能力。Kalashtar是与人类宿主合并的平面实体，赋予他们心灵感应的能力。变形人由人类和狼人的混合发展而来，这种结合赋予他们有限的兽性能力和野性的本能。战神是在最后一次战争中创造出来的一个构造种族，他们试图在战后的世界中找到自己的位置。",
						"{@b 7. D&D with a Twist}. {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}、{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}和{@book Monster Manual|MM}中的每个种族、怪物、咒语和魔法物品都在Eberron的某个地方有一席之地，但可能不是你期望的地方。Eberron在D&D多元宇宙中有着独特的位置，许多熟悉的游戏元素在这个世界中扮演着不同的角色。特别是，凡人生物是文化和环境的产物，而不是诸神的直接影响。因此，你不能假设金龙是好的，或看守者是邪恶的；只有在天人、魔人和某些其他生物的身份和世界观由魔法塑造的情况下（如狼人的诅咒），才会有一致的看法。"

						"每个孩子都知道始祖龙的故事：西伯利亚斯、艾伯伦和凯伯尔。在时间的黎明，这三个宇宙生物创造了13个存在的平面，每个平面都体现了一个概念。他们的最终作品是物质界，在那里所有的想法都将得到体现：一个可以知道战争与和平、生命与死亡、秩序与混乱的领域。但残酷的凯伯寻求对这个新现实的最终支配权。她毫无征兆地打击了西伯利亚，并将他撕碎。Eberron与Khyber搏斗，将叛徒捆绑在她的线圈中，但无法击败她。于是Eberron成为了一个活生生的监狱，这个世界将永远容纳Khyber的邪恶。",

A predatory aspect permeates life in Droaam but also a sense of excitement, the belief that the Daughters will lead Droaam to greatness.

Bound within the world, Khyber spawns demons and monsters to plague the children of Eberron. This might be myth and metaphor, but it's also a description of fact: there are worlds within the world, realms inhabited by aberrations, fiends, and all manner of monsters.",
						"Any time someone descends below the surface of the world, they enter Khyber. But the underworld takes two very different forms. First is the natural realm, networks of tunnels and caverns formed from stone and soil. These passages are dark and dangerous, but they're exactly what you expect to find in an underground realm. Such passages might be home to carrion crawlers, giant beetles, or clans of kobolds. But ultimately these mundane caverns follow the laws of nature.",
						"There's another aspect to Khyber: go deep enough and you find a seemingly endless array of demiplanes, each stranger than the last. When descending into a chasm, you could find a labyrinth inhabited by demons or discover a realm consisting of the guts of a colossal living creature. Anything is possible in Khyber, and these \"worlds within\" are home to all manner of terrors.",
						"The demiplanes of Khyber are not concretely tied to the world above. You could discover a passage in Breland that leads into a disturbing subterranean swamp filled with oozes and slimes. After traveling what seems to be a few miles, you might emerge from a different tunnel in Xen'drik, half a world away from where you began.",
						"The Mror Holds demonstrate this mystery. Over the past century, the dwarves discovered a vast subterranean kingdom within the Ironroot Mountains. Most of these halls rest in the natural layers of Khyber. The halls connect to one another in logical cartographic order. But as the ancient dwarves dug deeper, they opened passages into the unnatural realms and unleashed the hordes of the daelkyr {@creature Dyrrn|ERLW} the Corruptor. Passages to {@creature Dyrrn|ERLW}'s realm also exist in the Shadow Marches, on the opposite side of Khorvaire. The Corruptor's domain doesn't necessarily stretch across the entire world; the portals to the worlds within defy natural law.",
						"These connections impact the world in a number of ways. Dark forces can rise anywhere in the world, bursting out of a previously unknown portal to Khyber. This fact dictates the primary mission of the Church of the Silver Flame: to stand ready to defend the innocent from such unnatural threats. Because the demiplanes connect to the world at random, you never know what you might find when you venture into the depths. A newly opened chasm in the sewers could be an entirely mundane hole in the ground, or it could be a passage to the Abyssal Forests of Khar.",
						"The many layers of Khyber share similarity only in their strangeness and deadliness. Eberron is the natural world; Khyber is the source of fiends and monstrosities and the domain of the alien daelkyr. Some cults of the Dragon Below believe that paradise awaits them in the Vale of the Inner Sun, but such cultists also consider gibbering mouthers and mind flayers to be creatures of beauty. Wondrous treasures might wait in the worlds below amid hordes of demons and aberrations.",

Despite the magnitude of this threat, portals to Khyber are very rare, and they are stable once found. If you dig a hole in the ground, the odds that you'll eventually reach the Vale of the Inner Sun are infinitesimal. And if a portal to Khyber existed in the sewers of Fairhaven, odds are good that it would already have been discovered. The risk arises when you're exploring passages where no one has gone before. The sewers of Fairhaven might be safe today, but if an earthquake opens a new shaft or a group of cultists digs deeper, a previously unknown passage to Khyber could be uncovered. Wherever a passage to Khyber appears, monsters and dark powers can rise up to threaten the world above.",
								"Cults of the Dragon Below often have ties to Khyber. Some serve aberrations or fight alongside dolgrims and dolgaunts (see {@book chapter 6|ERLW|13}). Others can unintentionally threaten a community by releasing something from the underworld: an unnatural disease, a malevolent demon, or a strange and addictive drug. In dealing with such a cult, the question is not only how to stop their current machinations, but how to seal the passage or prevent it from posing an ongoing threat.",
								"Treasures from Khyber can take many forms. The daelkyr create living tools, including symbionts (see {@book chapter 5|ERLW|12}), but any magic item could be presented as an organic creation: a living {@item Cape of the Mountebank||cloak of the mountebank} that teleports its wearer through the plane of madness; a {@item dagger of venom} made from chitin and muscle, similar to a scorpion's barb; a {@item crystal ball} made by the daelkyr {@creature Belashyrra|ERLW} that looks like a giant eye, casting visions of distant places directly into the wielder's mind. Items recovered from fiendish demiplanes might be constructed from standard materials but have a sinister aspect or appearance, such as a {@item sword of life stealing} from the Abyssal Forest of Khar made of jagged, blackened steel.

						"Any follower of the Sovereign Host knows this story about Xen'drik. In the dawn of time, the Sovereigns bound the fiendish overlords and freed the world from chaos. The mighty giants had fought alongside the Sovereigns, and in gratitude Aureon granted them dominion over the continent of Xen'drik. Aureon taught giants the secrets of wizardry, and they grew powerful. The giants built towers that touched the sky and seemingly endless cities.",
						"The mightiest among the giants was the titan Cul'sir. His power was so great that he pulled the thirteenth moon from the sky and crushed it in a fit of anger. The giants ruled many lesser races, and eventually the elves rose up against them. Cul'sir unleashed plagues upon the rebellious elves. He made assassins of elven shadows and turned them back against their owners. Still the rebels persisted. In his anger, Cul'sir prepared to pull down the rest of the moons to hurl them at his enemies, even though he'd destroy the world in doing it. But the giants had gone too far, and Aureon set the dragons of Argonnessen upon them. The dragons destroyed the vast cities and leveled the towers. Cul'sir was slain and his people scattered.",
						"The Sovereigns and Six each laid a curse upon the land. Aureon decreed that the creatures of Xen'drik would have no knowledge of law, and Boldrei proclaimed that no city would stand. The Traveler distorted the land so that no path followed twice. The Devourer unleashed fire and storm. And so Xen'drik remains a land of mystery, a realm that cannot be mapped, a place that holds secrets that could shatter the world.",
						"This story bears at least some truth. The elves were once slaves of the ancient giants, and the dragons did eradicate the civilizations of Xen'drik. Great magic has warped the land. The environments of Xen'drik are extreme and unpredictable, and travelers might find a glacial expanse in the midst of a vast desert. Tens of thousands of years have passed, yet no civilization has risen to the heights of the fallen giants; some believe that Aureon's and Boldrei's curses ensure that any city that grows too large collapses into madness. The Traveler's Curse twists space, and explorers might follow the same path twice only to end up in entirely different locations.",

Something else you should know about Abactor Malevanor: he's been dead for over fifty years! This putrid priest says that there's nothing unholy about his condition, swearing that his people revere all life.

										"Banners are flying across Dura today, and the streets are full of color. Walk through Oldkeep wearing brown and red, and you'll be invited to raise a glass to the Griffon; if you're dressed in white and gold, the colors of the Hippogriff, you'd best be prepared to defend yourself.",
										"If you're new to Sharn, you might think our city's gone mad. And in some ways it has, but it's a madness that reaches its peak every summer with the Race of Eight Winds. Long ago, King Galifar used Dura as a proving ground for aerial calvary. What's more important, quickness or strength? Our modern race is a test of speed and skill through a course that weaves around and through the spires of Dura. There are eight competitors, and each of these brave jockeys rides a different flying creature—except for the gargoyle Carralag, who relies on his own wings!",
										"Speed is important, but merely surviving the race can be a challenge. The spilling of blood isn't prohibited, but the only weapon a rider can carry is a light sporting crossbow; the steeds can use their talons and beaks, which is what makes the Griffon such a fierce contender. Poison, magic, or anything else that would directly interfere with beast or rider is strictly forbidden—though over the years we've certainly seen imaginative attempts to stretch the rules!",
										"Dura is divided into eight regions for the race, each of which is represented by a different creature. If you're going to spend time in Dura, it's best that you know your mounts! The beasts of Upper Dura are the fastest in the race, and overall have the best record. The reigning champion is the Pegasus of Highwater, whose supporters wear white and silver. The Hippogriff is tied to Overlook and Daggerwatch in Upper Dura, and its colors are white and gold. Detractors often say that the Sharn Watch favors the Hippogriff and that House Vadalis helps the Pegasus, but the referees always insist that the race is fair.",
										"The beasts of Middle Dura are versatile. The Eagle represents Broken Arch and Stormhold in Middle Dura, and its supporters wear brown and gold. The clever Owl flies for Rattlestone and the Bazaar, and its colors are brown and gray. The Hawk represents Tumbledown and Underlook in Middle Dura, and wearing its blend of tan and brown can usually get you a good price at an inn.",
										"The beasts of Lower Dura are more infamous than reliable. The Griffon flies for Precarious and Oldkeep, and its colors are brown and red. It has never won the race, but there's gold to be made betting on which opponent it will bring down. The Glidewing represents Gate of Gold and The Stores, and its supporters wear green and gray; many believe that the Boromar Clan pays for the upkeep of the mount and its rider. Malleon's Gate used to be represented by the Bat, but twelve years ago they exchanged that mascot for the Gargoyle, whose colors are black and gray. The current {@creature Gargoyle} is a stone-faced fellow named Carralag, and his supporters are quite passionate about their winged champion."

								"As befits a metropolis that boasts people of all cultures, Sharn hosts a wide variety of sports and athletic events. The Race of Eight Winds occurs once a year. Other events take place on a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule. For instance, shifters hold informal hrazhak competitions every night in Lower Northedge. The ogres of the Cogs are fond of tugs-of-war, arm wrestling, and similarly simple tests of strength. People who want to bet on sports can usually find a gambler willing to set odds in the Firelight district in Lower Menthis, Callestan in Lower Dura, Cornerstone in Middle Tavick's Landing, or Hareth's Folly in Middle Dura.

To score, a team must steal its opponent's idol and place both idols in its own goal. Obstacles such as trees, streams, and piles of rubble can be present on a hrazhak field, requiring the competitors to make full use of their jumping and climbing abilities. Idols can be thrown or carried, and there are no limits on contact between participants, although only natural weapons are allowed. Typically, a low-level druid or adept is on hand to provide healing if needed—but any competitor who receives aid is removed from play for the remainder of the match. Competitors aren't allowed to use spells or similar abilities.",
										"The only formal hrazhak arena in Sharn is located in the Stone Trees, part of the Cornerstone district, where the matches serve as both a spectator sport and a reason for gambling. Shifters created temporary hrazhak fields in the slums and warehouse districts of the city from time to time, and shifter youths often play impromptu games in the parks."

Formal matches take place in one of Sharn's two aerial arenas, in Cornerstone and Hareth's Folly. Skyblades jousters typically ride {@creature Hippogriff||hippogriffs} and carry blunted lances that deal nonlethal damage.",
										"Informal matches, which don't always use the same rules, occur from time to time in Lower and Middle Dura, Tavick's Landing, and Menthis Plateau. An informal match might be played out across an entire district, with competitors weaving between towers and around bridges.

A {@creature medusa} handler monitors the competition to ensure that rules are followed. Contestants carry no arms or armor, and no magic or supernatural abilities may be used. Additionally, no one is allowed to attack the cockatrice. The challenge lies in outlasting the other contestants and luring them or pushing them into the path of the cockatrice. The battleground might be barren or littered with rubble and cover; it might be lit, or it could be be pitch black.",
										"Six stones matches are staged by the criminal organization Daask (see the \"{@book Criminal Activities|ERLW|8|Criminal Activities}\" section later in this chapter). The sport is illegal, but the games go on because the matches are confined to Lower Dura and the Cogs and well hidden from the eyes of the Watch. A match usually occurs only once every few months. Sometimes participants voluntarily enter the competition, but most are debtors who have been offered a chance to pay off their loans by winning the match. Daask takes bets on the outcome, and usually earns a tidy sum as its share of the proceeds."

												"If you've read more than two issues of the {@i Sharn Inquisitive}, you've seen at least two stories about the ir'Tain family. King Boranel might rule Breland, and the Lord Mayor might be our highest appointed official, but the ir'Tains are the true royalty of our city. What citizen of Sharn doesn't have an opinion about the fate of Lord Dalian ir'Tain, lost at sea a decade ago? Many are sure that he's a prisoner of the sahuagin, which would explain why Lady Celyria has been funding expeditions into the sahuagin realms. Another camp maintains that Lord Dalian staged his death so he could embrace a swashbuckling life as a pirate king. If the truth ever comes out, you can be sure you'll read about it here!",
												"Matriarch Lady Celyria ir'Tain is the queen of high society in Sharn. Her activities and those of the ir'Tain children account for just as much newsprint as their father used to. Dalian's eldest son, Dalas ir'Tain, shocked society last week when he publicly denounced the Brelish monarchy. The dalliances of younger siblings Cyra and Daral sell more issues of the {@i Inquisitive} whenever such are reported, and the wedding of middle sister Cariana ir'Tain and Mayne Jhaelian of Aerenal will surely be the biggest social event of 998 YK.",
												"The ir'Tain fortune is tied to the City of Towers. Tain gold funded the construction of many of the towers of Sharn, and the family owns vast sections of the city. You've likely heard of the Sixty Families of Sharn, considered the guiding lights of the city. Most assume that these luminaries are ancient and established, their status tied to a royal decree. In fact, when the Tains built their mansion on Skyway, they ordered the architects to design a banquet hall that would seat sixty families and their servants. The original Sixty Families were those that received standing invitations to the first Tain Gala. Though the list has remained generally stable through the years, just last year Celyria expelled the ir'Moros family and gave their place to Saiden Boromar—a surprising advancement for a family that began as Cliffside hooligans.",
												"Anyone who strives to rise in Sharn society must earn the favor of the Sixty. Similarly, those who seek to explore and adventure in the wake of the Last War can surely find patrons among these elite. And from our desks, we will be watching to see which families will be next to rise and fall."

There's no such person on the rolls of the bardic colleges of Breland, and House Phiarlan and House Thuranni claim to know nothing about her. Syara shuns the spotlight and refuses all interviews. While her works are being debated and celebrated in classrooms and taverns, the artist spends her days in the dingy back rooms of the Diamond Theater. This seclusion has led to a number of fanciful rumors. Some say Syara fought in the Last War and that she was in Metrol on the Day of Mourning. A wilder rumor maintains that she is an exile from the Faerie Court of Thelanis, an archfey bound to human form.",
										"While we wait for answers to this mystery, we encourage you to sample Syara's latest work. {@i Five Lives} is a gutwrenching tragedy that forces us to look at our darkest hours, and to consider the suffering of our enemies and the common threads that unite us all. If you're looking to forget your troubles, by all means, go see {@i Facade} or {@i The Late Count}. But if you want to take in a performance that might make you a better person, do whatever it takes to get tickets to {@i Five Lives}."

The heart of Shae Lias is the Gates of Passage, a grand structure that is both the Aereni embassy and a temple to the Undying Court. The priests of the Undying Court don't share this information with outsiders, but many residents believe that an actual member of the Court—an ancient undead elf possessing vast knowledge and divine power—resides in the temple.",
								"Other points of interest in Shae Lias include the Oaks, one of the finest restaurants in Sharn, which serves food of the highest quality (and priced accordingly). The Veil of Flesh specializes in Aereni body art, in the form of both traditional tattoos and temporary illusions woven directly into the skin. The business known as Nightshade might be the most unusual watering hole in Sharn, doubling as apothecary and tavern; the house specialty is beverages tainted with weak poisons, designed to take the imbiber to the very edge of death."

Over a century ago, a gnome named Daca climbed atop the pedastal. She has remained there ever since, and shouts advice to anyone who passes by. Although Daca doesn't claim to be a priest, the people of the community say that she's blessed by the god Boldrei and speaks with the Sovereign's voice.

This old city was destroyed by dark magic, courtesy of the elemental powers of the infamous Halas Tarkanan and his consort, the Lady of the Plague. It is said that vile powers still linger in these ruins, and for this reason King Galifar I had all the passages to this undercity sealed with gates of metal and magic. These portals remain sealed today, and it's illegal to tamper with them. But it's generally assumed that many treasures are hidden in the ruins of Old Sharn, along with untold secrets of the past.",
								"No one knows exactly what lurks in Old Sharn. The ruins could contain ghosts or other undead, the vengeful spirits of the aberrant-marked people who took refuge in the fallen city. In olden times, the Lady of the Plague had power over vermin and disease, and a fanciful tale says that even today the undercity is inhabited by swarms of sentient rats and beetles."

An army of aberrant heirs made their home here in the early days of Sharn, led by Halas Tarkanan—known as the Earthshaker—and the Lady of the Plague, who had power over vermin and disease. When the dragonmarked houses laid siege to the city and their defeat became inevitable, the two unleashed their full might. Tarkanan's power reduced the early towers to rubble, and the Lady of the Plague called forth a horde of disease-infested vermin.",

It had shrines and statues dedicated to the Sovereigns, a proud church of the Silver Flame, even a monument to the Undying Court. But as Sharn grew and prospered, religious services were moved to grander temples in the upper wards. Godsgate became a tenement district, and the shrines and monuments were forgotten and left to decay. The final blow to this once-proud district came early in the Last War. A team of Aundairian saboteurs brought down one of Sharn's floating towers, and the falling spire struck Godsgate. Buildings collapsed, and hundreds died. Untended corpses led to infection and disease. The City Council had no interest in sinking gold into Lower Dura to restore the area, and the district was abandoned.",

Those who venture into Fallen must deal with the Ravers, feral savages that lurk in the shadows. There's no question that the Ravers exist, but their true nature remains a subject of debate. A common hypothesis is that they're the descendants of the original inhabitants of the district, who were possessed and driven mad by the ghosts of those who died when the tower fell. Others claim that House Vadalis has been trying to magebreed super-soldiers, and the Ravers are the result of failed experiments.",

These sewer clans constantly battle over territory, as control of one or more midden chamber can be critical to survival.

Also, the court can confiscate possessions in lieu of receiving payments in gold; you might not care about having to pay a fine of 100 gp, but having your grandfather's magic sword confiscated instead might sting.

After the adventurers kill their nemesis, they might next encounter the villain raised from the dead or as an undead. It's conceivable that dying could make a villain more powerful and more angry at the meddling adventurers. Alternatively, the characters might assume a villain is dead—after falling over a waterfall, being trapped in a burning building, or getting swallowed by a purple worm—only to discover later that the villain survived and is hungry for revenge."

The Aurum frequently engages in acts of philanthropy, and thus some members might be celebrated by their local communities.",

Aurum members often take an interest in a particular civilization or era of history; one Concordian collects relics of the Cul'sir giants of Xen'drik, while another pursues artifacts of the dragons of Argonnessen. One of the most common ways in which adventurers cross paths with the Aurum is through these collectors. Members of the Aurum often fund expeditions to exotic lands or newly discovered ruins, interested in expanding their private hoards. Occasionally a Concordian tries to acquire prized relics through less honorable means; adventurers could be employed to acquire an exotic prize from a rival through any means necessary, legal or otherwise.",

Either way, these can provide the Shadow Cabinet with unexpected military power.",

As the campaign unfolds, the dragons of the Chamber might reveal that the adventurers have their own part to play—in particular, perhaps, any member of the party who bears a dragonmark. The Chamber begins interfering in the characters' activities, for good and for ill, and the Lords of Dust might also get involved. Unfortunately for the adventurers, the dragons are not necessarily any more concerned for their well-being than the Lords of Dust are, and the characters might have to consort or cooperate with demons in order to escape the clutches of the dragons.",

Locations such as the planar observatory described here might be able to give the adventurers some insight into the substance of the Prophecy they have become tangled up in, and seers and sages might be able to offer further insight into the different ways that the demons and the dragons could be interpreting those words. Ultimately, the adventurers might be in the position of having to choose between an outcome that is bad for them but good for the world in the long term, or a short-term triumph that carries tremendous risk for the world in the distant (or not too distant) future.",

Others think that either of those assumptions gravely underestimates the abilities of the Daughters and their subjects.",
										"In the aftermath of the war, the fighting forces of Droaam have become a significant resource for other nations of Khorvaire. Gnolls, minotaurs, ogres, and other creatures have proven to be capable mercenaries and laborers, and the Daughters have worked with House Tharashk to make these resources available to the rest of Khorvaire. This exchange both puts gold into the Daughters' coffers, and spreads their eyes and ears throughout the wider world."

										"When involving the Daughters of Sora Kell in your campaign, the first question you need to answer is: what are their goals for Droaam?",
										"One possibility is that the Daughters believe in their nation—that it is important to them to unite the monsters of Droaam and to give their charges a voice in the world. In this case, the Daughters can be ultimately sympathetic figures. They are fighting against the fears and prejudices of the people of the Five Nations, and also the selfish ambitions of many of their own power-hungry warlords. Once the adventurers learn that the Daughters truly want peace and prosperity, they could become envoys of the Daughters in the Five Nations or help to fight their enemies in Droaam. A character of a monstrous race could even become a warlord of Droaam. Even if the adventurers don't work directly with the Daughters, they could have need of their assistance; Sora Teraza might hold the answer to a vital mystery, or the adventurers might need an artifact hidden in the vaults of the Great Crag.",
										"If you'd rather use the Daughters as straightforward villains, they could be driven by a thirst for power or a desire to end humanity's dominance over Khorvaire. Sora Teraza's visions enable them to target enemies with unerring precision and reveal enemy plans before they are carried out. Can the adventurers find a way to deal with Sora Teraza and end this threat before the armies of Droaam and agents of Daask make their move?",
										"A middle-of-the-road view is that the Daughters are motivated solely by Sora Teraza's visions. They have no interest in gaining power or in maintaining their kingdom; they are fulfilling their role in a story that is still unfolding, and once it's resolved, they will abandon their thrones and return to their hidden haunts. Can Droaam survive without the Daughters, or will the nation dissolve into chaos?",
										"Whatever path you choose should also be reflected in the nature of the criminal organization Daask, described later in this chapter. Those monsters are agents of Sora Katra; how do their actions support her agenda? Are they seizing power on behalf of Droaam, or are they pursuing a more mysterious agenda?",
										"As described in {@book chapter 1|ERLW|4}, Sora Kell herself could be a group patron for a party of adventurers. In this case, the characters' relationship with the sisters is complicated. Do the Daughters consider the adventurers to be allies, or are they bitter rivals? Does Sora Kell support the nation of Droaam, or are the Daughters defying the wishes of their mother?"

						"The Gatekeepers maintain the oldest druidic tradition on Khorvaire. Over fifteen thousand years ago, the green dragon Vvaraak came to the Shadow Marches and gathered a following from among the orcs of the region. In her studies of the Prophecy, Vvaraak had foreseen a great threat that could be stopped only by the younger races. So she taught the orcs the secret language of the natural world and showed them how to work with stone and soil, and how to read the future in the movement of the Ring of Siberys. She charged her students to remain ever vigilant against the threat that was to come, and to protect nature from those that would corrupt it.",
						"Thousands of years later, the daelkyr (see {@book chapter 6|ERLW|13}) opened gates from the plane of Xoriat and unleashed hordes of mind flayers, beholders, and other foul creatures into the world. The conflict that followed destroyed the goblin empire of Dhakaan, and the daelkyr's invasion left scars across Khorvaire. Ultimately, Vvaraak's students sealed the gates and imprisoned the daelkyr in Khyber. Even after this triumph, the orcs couldn't be sure if they had turned back the threat Vvaraak had foreseen, or if a greater danger lay ahead. So, in addition to guarding the seals that bind the daelkyr and keep Xoriat at bay, the Gatekeepers remained vigilant against the possibility of worse to come.",
						"In the millennia since that struggle ended, the Gatekeepers have shared Vvaraak's wisdom and druidic magic with humans, shifters, and others who came to Khorvaire. New interpretations of Vvaraak's teachings gave birth to new druid sects: the Wardens of the Wood, the Greensingers, and the Ashbound. Today, the Gatekeepers are one of the smaller sects, and many of the sites of their long-ago battles have been abandoned and forgotten. But some Gatekeepers still remain in the Shadow Marches and the Eldeen Reaches, continuing their vigil to this day.",

Sometimes the Gatekeepers failed in those efforts, and Xoriat's corruption spread over some remote regions while the war raged around them."

It ended when the Mourning destroyed Cyre, because people were afraid that the war itself was the cause of that cataclysm, and that continuing the struggle could doom them all. Many are sick of the endless conflict and embrace the peace. But just as many yearn to finish what their ancestors started, and others see potential profit for themselves in war. Some leaders focus on healing the lingering wounds of the conflict, while others work to ensure that their people will have an edge when fighting begins anew.",
						"The Last War is one of the primary themes of Eberron. When developing an adventure in Khorvaire, consider how the lingering impact of the war could affect the story. Some element of the war could drive the entire adventure; the heroes could be tasked with recovering a relic lost in the war, or capturing a fugitive war criminal. But it can also be a background note that simply adds flavor to a story. If the adventure features a group of bandits, perhaps they're deserters, which can be all the more interesting if they once served in the army of the same nation as one of the player characters.",

If more than one of the characters fought in the war, did they serve together (or as allies) or fight on opposing sides? Military service can be the basis of a strong connection for two or more characters.",
								"{@b Civilian Life}. If the character is from one of the Five Nations and didn't fight in the war, how and why did they remain on the sidelines? Did they oppose the war? Did they do something to avoid conscription, or was there a reason they were considered unsuitable for service?",
								"{@b Personal Loss}. What did the characters lose during the war? Did members of their family die, and if so, how? Was the village they grew up in destroyed, and if so, who was responsible? If the characters are from Cyre, they have lost their nation. Do they have any loved ones left? Did they spend time in a refugee camp or in the outpost of New Cyre in Breland? Do they support Prince Oargev as the leader of Cyre, or do they have other ideas for the nation's future?",
								"For example, when an Aundairan player character meets a group of Eldeen druids, it's an opportunity to exploit the bad blood between Aundair and the Eldeen Reaches and to determine if this interaction has any personal relevance to the character. If a player character has the soldier background, you can introduce an NPC as a former comrade and work out the details with the player on the spot.

						"What arose as an order of militant knights within the nation of Karrnath fell into disgrace and became a shattered remnant. The Order of the Emerald Claw now operates as a collection of cells of fanatical warriors, necromancers, and spies. On the surface, its members seem to be driven by Karrnathi patriotism, and they purport to be adherents of the Blood of Vol. The most cursory investigation reveals that claim to be a facade.",
						"The truth behind the Emerald Claw is that they serve the lich {@creature Lady Illmarrow|ERLW}, and in her name they carry out acts of destruction, murder, and necromantic terrorism. They have been linked to the theft of powerful items imbued with necromancy magic, and they often employ vicious undead minions that make even other Karrns uncomfortable. Most worshipers of the Blood of Vol are quick to point out that they don't accept the order's claim to membership in their faith, and those true worshipers vehemently reject the Emerald Claw's violent fanaticism.",

								"During the Last War, Karrnath was forced to embrace the practice of necromancy to bolster the ranks of its army. At the same time, a number of chivalric orders were founded by devoted worshipers of the Blood of Vol. These groups included necromancers and bone knights that were trained to raise and command the undead troops used during the war. The Order of the Emerald Claw was one of the most infamous of these groups, renowned for its fighting skills but often sanctioned for its brutal treatment of enemy soldiers. The Emerald Claw were also accused of slaughtering civilians so they could be raised as skeletons or zombies—behavior that was strictly forbidden by the Karrnath commanders.",
								"When King Kaius III came to power near the end of the war, he turned against the Blood of Vol. The orders were disbanded, and many members of the Emerald Claw were condemned as war criminals. While the other orders complied with the king's edict, many knights of the Emerald Claw refused to surrender. The order fragmented as its original members scattered, but a number of those rebellious knights started their own cells, rallying all who wanted to see Karrnath achieve its rightful glory. The order experienced a surge in membership following the Treaty of Thronehold because many Karrns thought that Kaius III had betrayed their nation by embracing peace.",
								"Six years ago, shortly after Kaius's accession, a figure known as {@creature Lady Illmarrow|ERLW} emerged as the leader of the Order of the Emerald Claw. Few of her followers know anything about her, other than her great skill as a necromancer; many members of the Order refer to her as Queen of the Dead. Some members of the order believe she will ultimately raise Karrnath above all other nations. Others simply trust that she will grant them personal power. They believe that she is poised to become a god of death, and that when she ascends to divinity, they will be granted immortality or at least the eternal life of undeath."

										"Stations throughout Khorvaire have a similar look and feel, to ensure that each one lives up to the high expectations of House Orien's patrons. White and gold {@i everbright lanterns} continually illuminate each station. When a train pulls into the station, loading ramps are moved into position beside each cargo cart, and stairs by each passenger cart. The cargo is unloaded from one side of the train and the passengers from the other.",

For example, the station in Gatherhold, in the Talenta Plains, is decorated with traditional halfling motifs and offers specialized stables for travelers leaving their dinosaurs behind. On a larger scale, the station at Passage, which is the seat of power for House Orien, is a multistoried structure designed as a monument to the majesty and storied history of the house."

The rowdy Brelish veterans who call themselves the Brokenbridge Brawlers don't think of themselves as criminals, and they have no connection to any larger organization.",
						"Any professional criminal in Sharn, however, is likely to be affiliated with one of four organizations. The Boromar Clan is the most entrenched and widespread of the four, and has dominated the business of crime in Sharn for centuries. The group called Daask is on the rise, directly challenging the Boromars. The Tyrants and House Tarkanan are smaller organizations with more specialized areas of operation. These groups are summarized in the Criminal Organizations of Sharn table and described in the later sections that follow.",
						"Each of these organizations has a core of operatives and enterprises under the direct control of its leaders. But each also has a network of secondary relationships.",
						"For example, the Little Fingers are a group of pickpockets and cutpurses that work in the Bazaar of Middle Dura. They aren't directly tied to the Boromar family. But the master of the gang pays a tithe to the Boromars, and if the Boromars send word to them that certain targets are to be avoided, the Little Fingers do so. In return, the Boromars ensure that the Sharn Watch in Middle Dura largely leaves the Fingers alone. So although the Boromar Clan itself has a few hundred members, it has interaction with thousands of criminals throughout the city.",

								"{@b Dragon's Blood}. Introduced into Sharn by Daask, dragon's blood is a potent and highly addictive stimulant. In addition to inducing euphoria, it can enhance spellcasting ability or even temporarily imbue a user with the ability to cast sorcerer spells. The drug's effects are potentially dangerous and always unpredictable. This isn't something a player character should want to use; adventurers are more likely to interfere with Daask smugglers or deal with an addict who accidentally casts a {@spell fireball} in a crowded street. The specific effects of dragon's blood are up to you, but you can take inspiration from the {@table Wild Magic Surge|PHB} table in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}.",
								"{@b Dreamlily}. A psychoactive liquid that smells and tastes like your favorite beverage, essence of dreamlily is a Sarlonan opiate. First imported to help manage pain during the Last War, it's now the most commonly abused substance in Sharn. Though dreamlily isn't illegal if used for medicinal purposes, it's heavily taxed, and thus most dreamlily is smuggled in and sold on the black market. Dreamlily dens can be found across the lower wards. Consuming dreamlily causes disorienting euphoria and brings about remarkable resistance to pain. A creature under the effects of dreamlily is {@condition poisoned} for 1 hour. While {@condition poisoned} in this way, the creature is immune to fear, and the first time it drops to 0 hit points without being killed outright, it drops to 1 hit point instead. A dose of dreamlily costs around 1 gp, or up to ten times that if purchased through legal channels. There are many varieties of the drug, however, and the duration or the price might vary accordingly."

The family owns tenements throughout Sharn and invests in shipping, storing both legal goods and contraband in many of the warehouses in Precarious and Cogsgate. In many districts, local officials and Sharn Watch officers have been taking bribes from the Boromars for generations.",

They are immigrants who've made good, common people who've risen to rival the barons and kings. They give the people what they want, whether it's untaxed gambling, cheap spirits, or dreamlily. The clan operates with a degree of impunity because its operatives adhere to an unspoken rule: whenever possible, criminal acts against individuals should target tourists and travelers. Boromar pickpockets don't prey on the people they see every day. Instead, they seek out the many strangers who move around the city all the time. The Watch officer who turns a blind eye to a pickpocket thus feels justified, since it's not the citizens of Sharn that are victimized.",

It is most infamous for its monstrous enforcers, but the organization also draws members from the destitute populace of Sharn—largely goblins and shifters, but also humans, dwarves, and any other humanoid who feels that the current system has failed them. Daask makes its money through acts of violence, from mugging to armed robbery to outright pillaging. The group has diversified in recent years, building an extortion racket—threatening violence if tribute isn't paid—and entering into the drug trade, selling both dreamlily and a mysterious substance called dragon's blood.",

The monstrous nature of its members reinforces this impression; most people consider the members of Daask to be savage beasts. The truth is more complicated. The Droaamites who make up the core of Daask aren't merely criminals; they are elite soldiers of Droaam working for Sora Katra, and part of an operation that is taking root in larger cities across Khorvaire. The seemingly random attacks by Daask are part of a larger plan that, if it succeeds, will eventually give Sora Katra a foothold in the heart of Khorvaire.",

The Boromars were surprised by the violence of these attacks and have suffered significant losses. Daask prefers guerrilla tactics, using only as many combatants as necessary to get a job done, never staying in one place too long, and quickly retreating back to their turf.

						"A common viewpoint among the citizens of Sharn is that in the upper wards, the Sharn Watch works for the wealthy; in the middle wards, it works for the Boromar Clan; and in the lower wards, it doesn't work at all. This assessment is close enough to the truth. There's an important undercurrent in the situation, however. Although most officers of the Watch take bribes, that doesn't mean all of them don't care about their city and won't try to keep their communities safe; they do so because they see their benefactors as being an important part of the continued health of their community. For instance, those officers who take gold from the Boromar Clan believe that the Boromars help keep the city running and give the people what they want. But if some strangers in town break the law, they're just troublemakers who deserve to be run in.",
						"As another example, the guards of the Dura Bazaar have an understanding with the gang of pickpockets known as the Little Fingers. As long as the thieves target only tourists and foreigners, the Watch will dismiss any charges brought against them. Why should an officer of the Sharn Watch care if some Aundarian with more gold than sense gets robbed? But if the Little Fingers pick on a local, they're asking for trouble. The relationship works both ways; the pickpockets are privy to things the Watch officers aren't, and they often warn the Watch about suspicious people or activities they witness.",
						"Watch officers do exist who are entirely crooked and care nothing for the law. At the other extreme, some officers are entirely honorable and place the law above all else, and most of those are willing to risk their lives to save an innocent bystander from a rampaging Daask troll. But most members of the Watch are pragmatists who put the needs of their clients uppermost, the needs of the citizenry second, and generally don't take action against locals.",
						"The upshot of all this is that the Watch's response to a crime can vary significantly depending on the nature of the crime and where it's committed. As a rule, when a crime is committed in Skyway, any of the upper or middle wards, Lower Central, Lower Tavick's Landing, or Precarious, members of the Watch arrive to intervene and investigate as soon as possible. In Cliffside, Lower Menthis, and Lower Northedge, the few Watch members in these locations address crimes in order of priority. In Lower Dura and the Cogs, the Watch's reponse is typically very slow.",

Like the Blackened Book, however, the Redcloaks are elite troops that act only when they're mustered by a captain of the Watch; typically, they won't be asked to respond to a situation if it's not in the interests of the Boromar Clan.

Eberron dragonshards can be found almost anywhere, but the most significant deposits have been discovered in jungle environments, notably Q'barra and Xen'drik. In their raw form, Eberron dragonshards are rosy crystals with crimson swirls flowing in their depths and are typically refined into a glowing powder. This dragonshard dust can be used to fuel almost any act of magic. When casting a spell, you can use Eberron dragonshard dust in place of any spell component that has a cost, unless the DM says otherwise (the dust's market value is the same as the replaced component).

These crystals typically grow on cavern walls, and superstition says they flourish in areas with significant fiendish activity. Khyber dragonshards are deep blue or dark violet, laced with gleaming veins. Khyber dragonshards have an affinity for binding magics. Elemental binding—which is behind airships, the lightning rail, and elemental galleons—requires a Khyber dragonshard to hold the elemental. Khyber shards are used for phylacteries, planar binding, and other effects that trap or manipulate spirits. Khyber dragonshards can also be used for necromantic rites.",

Siberys dragonshards are amber in color, with swirling golden veins gleaming within. These dragonshards are used in the crafting of magic items that require dragonmarks for attunement.

The Great Old One warlock patron is an excellent match to {@creature Belashyrra|ERLW} or {@creature Dyrrn|ERLW}, but other classes can just as easily reflect a connection to this darkness. For example, a barbarian's rage might be seen as a form of daelkyr-induced madness, or a sorcerer's Sorcerous Origin could be the result of a daelkyr experiment.",
														"When a character has a tie to a daelkyr, consider whether that tie was chosen or thrust upon them. Is the character a cultist who embraces their dark path, believing that a world transformed by the daelkyr will be a better place? Or is the character a victim of the daelkyr, consumed by the fear of what they might become?",
														"The touch of the daelkyr might be purely mental, or it might be accompanied by a physical transformation. A barbarian touched by {@creature Belashyrra|ERLW} might serve as an eye of the All-Seer but remain physically unchanged, even as a barbarian tied to {@creature Dyrrn|ERLW} takes on aberrant features while raging. When a warlock character gains the Devil's Sight invocation, they might literally gain the fiery red eyes of a devil."
