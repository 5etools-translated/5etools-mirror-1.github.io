				"万岁，你好，旅行者! 欢迎来到一个充满魔法和冒险的世界。被遗忘的领域最初由艾德-格林伍德创造，几十年来一直是《龙与地下城》故事和游戏的家园。为剑与魔法的故事而建，该领域最初在艾德的D&D活动中发展和繁荣，其中有像达勒兰的神话德兰诺骑士这样的英雄。埃德还在《龙》杂志的页面上分享了王国的一瞥，为D&D玩家提供了来自巫师埃尔明斯特的第一个故事，他是影子谷的老圣人，偶尔会通过法鲁恩和我们的世界之间的门户，进入埃德的客厅。",
				"当当时拥有D&D的TSR公司寻求一个新的战役世界来扩展D&D的多元宇宙时，他们选择了被遗忘的领域，在1987年，大门被打开，全世界的玩家和地下城主都可以来到Faerûn，创造他们自己的英雄故事。一年后，作者R.A. Salvatore在他的第一部小说《水晶碎片》中向读者介绍了被抛弃的鸦人Drizzt Do'Urden的冒险故事，确立了暗黑世界作为王国的重要组成部分。",
				"在那之后的几年里，被遗忘的王国成为了大量游戏产品、小说、视频游戏等的主人，使其成为有史以来访问量最大的奇幻背景之一。随着越来越多的游客来到这里，被遗忘的领域的门户又回来了，并在我们的想象力的深处保持开放，直到今天也是如此。",
				"因此，被遗忘的领域成为第五版《龙与地下城》第一批冒险的背景并不奇怪。新的英雄们已经完成了伟大的事迹，将法鲁恩从可怕的邪恶中拯救出来，并将继续这样做，只要想象力的火焰将他们吸引到那里。",
				"本书是这些冒险和第五版《玩家手册》、《地下城主指南》和《怪物手册》中对王国的一瞥所引发的火种的进一步推动。它让你对法鲁恩大陆和托里尔世界有一个大致的了解，特别是剑海岸和北方地区。",
				"在这些页面中，你将了解到法鲁恩的历史、土地和人民，了解到剑海岸和北方的伟大城邦，了解到这个世界的神灵，以及支持和威胁文明的派别和力量。本书第1章概述了剑海岸和附近的土地、其历史、魔法的作用以及其宗教。第二章详细介绍了剑海岸的城市和其他地点。第3章给出了在剑海岸和北方可以遇到的各种种族和亚种族的历史和一些游戏材料，包括普通和不普通的种族。第4章展示了《玩家手册》中的角色选项如何适应这一地区，并介绍了被遗忘的领域特有的新角色类别选项。第五章给出了旨在将你的角色与法鲁恩的伟大地方、人物和事件联系起来的背景。",
				"虽然境界的传说非常庞大，而且本书只是一个介绍，但被遗忘的境界的设定就像D&D本身一样，是属于你的，而且自从Ed打开第一个入口并邀请我们来参观时就一直如此。境界是一个创造和讲述你的故事的地方，关于你的冒险者和他们的事迹。法鲁恩的土地和人民欢迎你，旅行者，因为它是一个充满危险的地方，非常需要你带来的英雄们。现在就去吧，穿过想象力的门户，进入等待着的广阔而奇妙的领域。",

				"在托里尔世界，西边是风起云涌的剑海，东边是神秘的卡拉图尔，这就是法鲁恩大陆。法鲁恩是一个拥有不同文化和种族的地方，它以人类的土地为主，无论是王国、城邦，还是精心维护的农村社区联盟。在人类的土地上，穿插着古老的矮人王国和隐蔽的精灵飞地，被同化的地精和半身人，以及更多的异国人民。",
				"对于那些愿意寻求冒险的人来说，在王国中可以获得大量的冒险机会。城市和国家之间的路线经常会穿越到强盗或掠夺性人类的领地。每个森林、沼泽和山脉都有自己的危险，无论是潜伏的强盗、野蛮的兽人和哥布林诺人，还是巨人和龙等强大的生物。遗迹点缀着风景和地表下蜿蜒的岩洞。在这些地方，每一个活着的种族的宝藏--以及一些死去的种族--都在等待着足够勇敢的冒险家来认领它们。",
				"法鲁恩充满了丰富的历史和奇妙的冒险与魔法故事，但其普通人的命脉是农业和贸易。大多数农村居民依靠耕种来维持生计，而生活在城市的法鲁尼人则从事熟练的贸易或利用体力来赚取生活费，因此他们可以购买别人提供的商品和食物。新闻和流言蜚语通过商队和船只在人口中心之间传播，这些商队和船只为贸易带来物资，而游吟诗人和吟游诗人则在酒馆、旅馆和城堡中讲述（或编造）故事，以告知和娱乐人们。冒险家们也在传播新闻--同时也在创造新闻!",
				"法鲁恩的普通民众对冒险者的看法是混合着钦佩、羡慕和不信任。民众认为，任何愿意为完全陌生的人冒生命危险的中坚力量都应该得到赞扬和奖励。但是这样的冒险家，如果他们成功了，就会以一些人认为令人震惊的速度积累财富和个人地位。即使是那些因其精力和英勇行为而钦佩这些冒险家的人，也可能会有疑虑：如果冒险家不注意或不知道危险，打开一个废墟或坟墓，把一个古老的邪恶释放到这个世界上，会有什么恐怖的事情发生？",
				"大多数居住在大陆上的人对Faerûn以外的土地几乎一无所知。受教育程度最高的民众同意Faerûn只是一个大陆，而Toril是世界的全部，但对于大多数人来说，他们没有经历过洲际旅行或星外探索，\"Faerûn \"对他们来说是一个足够大的概念。",
				"除了在最偏远的地方，法鲁尼人习惯于看到不同文化、民族和种族的人。只有在最国际化的地区，这种随意的接受才会延伸到邪恶的人形种族--如哥布林人、兽人和乌鸦--更不用说更危险的生物。冒险家们倾向于更加宽容，接受流亡者、不合群者和来自陌生土地和具有不寻常形状的被救赎者。",

										"1485年，在冰风谷，奥里尔的神选者与十方镇挑起战争并被击败。在阿诺罗奇，看到尼瑟斯的部队被分散，长期被奴役的贝丁人反叛了。在击败或围困了北方的矮人家庭后，兽人向银月城进军。在科米尔（Cormyr）和森比亚（Sembia），尼德勒人和科米勒人交换地盘，而达利兰（Dalelands）则成了一个战区。仿佛是为了抵消南方的干旱，1485年秋天，大雨开始在堕星海周围落下，并持续不断。",

										"1486年晚些时候，大雨终于减弱，但这一事件并不意味着混乱的结束。堕星之海不断扩大，将大片土地淹没在其波浪之下。",
										"1487年初，地震和火山爆发接连发生了几个月，仿佛整个世界都在抽搐。咒语瘟疫造成的裂缝突然消失的传闻也在流传，已知的目的地彼此之间的距离越来越远，仿佛世界悄悄地在它们之间增加了几英里的荒野。自法术瘟疫以来没有听说过的地方和民族的消息开始传播。很明显，那个可怕时期的一些影响已经被逆转。在这一年里，自称来自埃弗米特、兰坦和宁布拉的船只--这些被认为已经消失或被摧毁的国家--驶入了剑海岸和闪耀南方的港口。在南方的天空中发现了传说中的Halruaa天船的故事。Netheril不再参与Cormyr，而是通过在Myth Drannor上空漂浮阴影之城来攻击它。在一场争夺神话德兰诺的神话和编织本身的斗争中，尼瑟尔的飞行首都被撞到了神话德兰诺，导致两者的灾难性毁灭。",
										"当这一年接近尾声时，有几个夜晚，天空似乎一动不动。在Faerûn的大部分地区，1487年和1488年的冬天比任何记录都要长。至点和分点不知不觉地漂移了。后来的季节也是如此，每个季节的开始和结束都比预期的晚。除了神选者的出现，向诸神祈求知识和仁慈的祈祷似乎没有得到承认。",
										"虽然兽人在北方被打败了，但银色马奇联盟在1488年解散了，因为以前的盟友为战争的失败互相指责。森比亚分裂成独立的城邦，只是在名义上相互结盟。虽然有少数定居点幸存下来，但尼德兰帝国已不复存在。剩余的尼瑟斯部队与贝丁人争夺记忆之塔的控制权，该塔被认为是尼瑟斯的古代敌人辉瑞姆的坟墓。这场战斗唤醒了那些被证明是蜂巢的生物，它们利用尖塔的生命和魔法消耗的力量来对付下面的土地。",
										"到了1489年，许多在分裂时期开始的战争已经结束了。其他的冲突出现了，强大的威胁仍然威胁着这个世界，但神灵不再通过他们的神选者干预这个世界了。众神不再沉默而是安静，在许多地方出现了新的神职来解释众神现在微妙的迹象。",
										"今天的世界似乎是一个充满新土地和机会的地方，在那里，那些有胆量的人可以留下他们的印记。研究历史的学生和那些回忆起被短命的人类视为遥远的过去的精灵和矮人，感知到的世界与一个多世纪前的世界很相似。对大多数人来说，被神赋予权力的人的疯狂故事，以及回归世界的遥远土地，是炉边谈话的主题。日常事务以及门外的危险和机会才是最重要的，而在剑海岸和北方，这两方面的问题都很多。"

										"随着时间的推移，穆尔霍兰德的神灵们对他们的追随者的关注也在动摇和减弱。伊希斯、奥西里斯和托斯的每一个新化身都多了几分人性，少了几分神性。一个多世纪前，当魔法强大的伊马斯卡里人报复性地回来时，他们把统治权杖从一个软弱得几乎没有任何力量的手中偷走了。",

								"在北方人的信仰中--这与矮人、精灵和其他人讲述的许多故事相吻合--阿斯摩德是九世之主，是九层地狱所有魔鬼的领袖。人们知道魔鬼是铁石心肠和银牙利齿的诱惑传播者，他们的好处的价格可以和人的灵魂一样珍贵。据说，当一个灵魂在赋格平面上等待神灵把它带到适当的来世时，魔鬼就会接近这个灵魂，给它一个获得权力和不朽快乐的机会。灵魂所需要做的就是走出尘埃和熙熙攘攘的人群，踏上代表九层地狱等级制度的地狱阶梯的第一层。",

								"对于那些不那么虔诚的人，阿斯莫德的祭司们提供了在来世得到缓和的前景。所有的灵魂都在赋格平面上等待神灵的喜悦，这决定了一个灵魂将在哪里度过余下的永恒岁月。那些生活中最符合神灵观点的人首先被带走。其他人，如果在他们所喜爱的神的眼中犯了错，或者没有遵循任何特定的道德规范，可能会在凯勒莫尔判断他们的去向之前等待几个世纪。害怕这种命运的人可以向阿斯莫德（Asmodeus）祈祷，他的牧师说，作为回报，一个魔鬼会给等待的灵魂一些安慰。",
								"今天，阿斯莫德的神龛仍很罕见，寺庙也几乎闻所未闻，但许多人都养成了向阿斯莫德请求赦免罪过的习惯。在以某种方式触犯了某位神灵之后，人们会向阿斯莫德祈祷，希望在漫长的等待中得到喘息的机会。众所周知，阿斯莫德会满足人们的愿望，因此人们祈求他们在生活中最渴望的所有乐趣和分心。那些犯了大错的人经常要求阿斯莫德向诸神隐瞒他们的罪过，祭司们说他会这样做，但死后要付出代价。"

								"坦帕斯是一位战神，关注战争期间的勇敢行为，使用武力而不是谈话来解决争端，并鼓励流血。战争之神的宠爱是随机的，这意味着他的混乱本性对所有各方的宠爱是平等的。坦普斯勋爵可能在某一天成为一支军队的盟友，而第二天又成为其敌人。他可能会在战斗前显灵，出现在一方或另一方。如果他被看到骑着一匹白色的母马（Veiros），那么军队就会成功。如果他骑着一匹黑色的骏马（Deiros），那么失败是肯定的。最常见的情况是，他在骑马时，每匹坐骑都有一只脚踩在马镫上，表示战斗的不可预测性。在这样的幻象中，坦普斯总是一个身强力壮的战士，按照设想他的人的风格为战斗而打扮。",
								"Tempus的宠爱可能是随机分配的，但几个世纪以来，他的牧师们努力传播和执行共同的战争准则--使战争成为一种规则、对声誉的尊重和专业行为。这套被称为 \"坦普斯的荣誉 \"的守则，其目的是使冲突简短、果断，并且对那些没有直接参与的人来说尽可能安全。守则中的规则包括以下内容：武装任何需要武器的人；不贬低任何敌人；勇敢地证明自己；为战斗训练所有人；不参与争斗。那些在井中投毒、玷污田地、杀害非战斗人员或以战争的名义从事酷刑的人都被视为罪人。",
								"崇拜坦普斯的人很多，他的名字经常出现在士兵的口中。他的祭司是战术家，通常精通战争艺术。他的许多受戒者不在寺庙中服务，而是作为军队和雇佣兵公司的战场牧师，用语言和刀剑鼓励他们的士兵。坦普斯的祭司们教导说，正确进行的战争是公平的，因为它平等地压迫所有各方，而且在任何特定的战斗中，一个凡人可能被杀，也可能成为他或她的同伴中的伟大领袖。凡人不应该害怕战争，而应该把它看作是一种自然力量，是文明的存在所带来的风暴。"

								"安菲勒的主权意味着，尽管沃特迪普城市卫队的巡逻队有时会骑马北上检查安菲勒的情况，但该镇唯一真正的权威是控制它的贵族家族的意愿。安普海尔的主要业务是养马，镇上是一个寻找替代坐骑的好地方，还有各种马具、辔头、饲料和其他养马所需的物品。大多数农场都有马夫，或者至少有一双能迅速给马穿鞋的手，而备用的鞋子在镇上随处可见。",
								"来到安菲勒的游客经常会被当地人礼貌地告诫 \"注意那些高高在上的人 \"或 \"银色马鞍\"，但那些无视这些警告的人，如果遇到贵族的麻烦，就别指望得到帮助。安菲拉人天生就对那些公开展示财富或地位的人持怀疑态度，而且在他们的生活中很早就知道，贵族是喜欢四处张扬的人，这对附近没有足够的钱财或足够大的头衔来对抗他们的人来说是不利的。我发现这些普通人是关于他们不信任的人的理想信息来源。",
								"就他们而言，在镇上随处可见的年轻贵族们似乎主要是因为他们可以做恶作剧。在城市里只会产生小心翼翼的侮辱的仇怨和竞争，当这些捣蛋鬼远离他们父母的监视时，就会升级为斗殴。由于过去引发的血仇，决斗早已被双方协议禁止，但在激烈的言语交锋中，人们的手往往会移向剑柄。几乎所有其他类型的贵族轻率行为都被强加给了安菲勒的居民。那些在贵族手中遭受财产损失或更糟的人被迫原谅罪行，以换取使用硬币或以违法者的名义作出的承诺（暗示年轻人的亲属将处理任何义务）。一些企业完全是通过将沃特德普的舒适性带到安菲勒来生存的，创造了一些让年轻贵族感到宾至如归的聚会场所。",

								"沃特德普的贵族家庭把他们的孩子送到安普海尔，或者允许他们去那里，希望他们的儿子和女儿在离开沃特德普时能学到一些关于生活的教训。如果他们要在这个过程中造成损害或伤害感情，至少他们会在远离本市其他贵族的监视下这样做。对年轻的贵族们来说，在安普海尔没有任何真正有影响的人，他们可能会因为任何不当行为而受到永久性的伤害。他们还认为，附近没有人注意到这些头脑发热的年轻人发出的吹嘘和宣扬他们的计划，我曾不止一次地通过听不同家族的孩子们互相吹嘘只属于家族的事情来了解威胁。",
								"除了贵族们的过度行为之外，安菲勒是一个和平的小镇，来自沃特德普和领主联盟的全面报复的威胁给任何扰乱那里的计划投下了漫长的黑暗阴影。沃特德普的贵族们有着沉重的钱包，他们愿意花费尽可能多的钱来保护他们喜爱的游乐场，并惩罚任何可能破坏他们对游乐场控制的人。贵族们唯一不能花掉的东西是粪便的味道，在夏天的几个月里，粪便的味道在小镇上空弥漫。正是这些粪便帮助养活了安菲勒的真正业务：用镇子周围许多农场的产品喂养沃特迪普。",
								"因为安菲儿的许多农场都属于阿玛基尔家族，所以到目前为止，该贵族家族的成员在那里的商业活动中是最富有的。他们认为自己是耕种土地的好地主，并且一定会将任何威胁到诚实、勤劳的平民的行为提交给看守大人和沃特德普的领主。任何威胁到安菲勒农业的行为都会直接威胁到辉煌之城，这种情况会被城市的卫队迅速而有效地处理。因此，即使是最叛逆的贵族也会小心翼翼地避免在安普海尔的安玛基尔地盘上踩上一脚，因为这样做的家族可能很快就会发现自己最喜欢的食物在狂欢或其他一些家族地位受到威胁的活动中突然难以采购了。"

										"在城墙外，没有任何法律禁止建筑或定居，因此那些太过贫穷而无法在城内居住或购买房产的人慢慢地建立了城市的第三区，生活在城墙的阴影下，缴纳城墙税，并覆盖通往博德之门的道路两侧。在这里，最穷的人住在外城，但那些被认为在城墙内经营太麻烦、太吵、太臭的人也住在外城，所以制革工人、铁匠、泥瓦匠、染匠和其他商人比比皆是。城市对这里的人们的帮助少得可怜，慈善家们（包括我自己）有时会带着满满的钱包从路的一端开始，但当他们到达另一端时却发现钱包已经空了。",
										"外城缺乏法律，导致了两个奇怪的现象，彼此之间没有关联。在城市的东部，一个有墙的卡利希特区已经发展起来，被Baldurian称为小卡利姆山。在这个地区，居民区被城墙分割开来，但这些城墙上面有人行道，因此，步行交通可以不受减缓马车和坐骑的城门的阻碍。在这里，来自卡里姆山的难民找到了一个远离南方国家的家，他们主要依靠自己的贸易、文化和防御。",
										"沿着奇安特河上的维尔姆十字路口也建起了建筑物。商店、酒馆和租房扼杀在桥上，悬挂在两个跨度上，甚至在某些情况下，建在支撑它的支架上。民众必须支付通行费才能步行或乘车或马车过桥，但许多人发誓他们会支付更多的钱来使用这座桥，而不必躲避侵扰该地区的小贩和顽童。"

								"这座有围墙的小城建在德林拜尔河洪泛区的一座低矮山丘边上，由当地公爵夫人莫文-达格福特女士的城堡主导。算上小镇本身以及附近的小村庄和农场的保护和指导，大约有一千二百人把这个地区当作自己的家。莫文夫人是前任公爵马尔德温-达格福特的妹妹，她似乎是一个有能力、有魅力的领导者。Daggerford家族对该地区的权力可以追溯到在该地区接替Phalorm的古老的人类王国。虽然那个王国已经尘封了几个世纪，但有些人将Daggerford视为和平、财富和影响力的美好时代的最后堡垒--如果有正确的领导，这个时代有最小的机会被恢复。",
								"Daggerford是一个牧民的天堂。附近宽阔无垠的山丘提供了宁静的视野，但有时会被突袭的兽人或哥布林侵占。经常有商队向北前往沃特迪普（Waterdeep）或向南前往博德之门（Baldur's Gate），需要护送或守卫，并能提供这两个城市（以及它们之间的定居点）的消息。除了在最繁忙的贸易或节日期间，有几家旅店随时准备接受游客，这时他们会迅速坐满，许多当地人会向住宿者开放他们的家。需要钱的勇士们可以通过为当地民兵提供训练员的服务来帮助他们的钱包，或者陪同镇上的卫队进行巡逻。",
								"日常统治权掌握在行会理事会手中，该理事会由该镇的非正式贸易团体的负责人组成。这些行会会长认为自己比实际情况更强大，更有影响力，他们模仿水底世界的领主，穿着长袍，戴着面具参加理事会会议。在大多数人眼里，这种戏法近乎于闹剧，因为在达格福德的每个人都清楚地知道谁是理事会成员，没有任何魔法可以掩盖公会领导人的形态、声音或举止，一个训练有素的间谍只需经过一两个晚上的适当观察就能知道哪个公会会长是谁。",
								"达格福最大和最古老的建筑是公爵城堡，这是一个由两层墙围起来的三层堡垒，里面有自己的铁匠铺，一个宽阔的阅兵场，以及大量动物的马厩。Daggerford的公爵们一直保持着一个充足的储藏室，能够喂饱城堡的居民和任何在围攻期间可能躲在里面的公民。",
								"有三道门通往达格福特镇。河门是通往河边的通道，航运货物通过河门进入小镇；大篷车门负责处理大多数陆路交通，包括陆路贸易；农夫门几乎在任何时候都是开放的，但其宽度只够一次让一辆马车或小车通过。",
								"一支民兵队守卫着Daggerford。所有身体健康的成年人都必须参加民兵服务，持续时间为20年。所有住在镇上的公民都要接受公爵夫人自己的士兵的指导，学习如何使用长矛和其他武器，并且每个月必须至少花一天时间来保卫城镇，在城墙上放哨或在附近的道路上巡逻。他们的训练意味着Daggerford的普通市民不会轻易被要求提供货物、硬币或通行证的武装分子吓倒，他们更有可能从事雇佣兵、商队守卫或冒险家的工作。",
								"虽然她没有她哥哥那么和蔼可亲，但莫文夫人被公认为比马尔德温公爵更有能力统治达格福。她深受人们的喜爱，人们明白她有一颗可敬的心，并希望为达格福特带来最好的东西。她经常与民兵一起训练，在镇上经常看到她穿着盔甲，就像她穿着适合她地位的衣服一样。她经常拜访当地的Tempus神庙，这只会提高她作为一个虔诚女人的声誉。莫文夫人的五官现在才开始衰老，仿佛赶上了她的白发。",
								"Daggerford的大多数人都互相认识，至少是随便看看。陌生人通常是受欢迎的，特别是如果他们有硬币可以花，除非这些人带着武器和好战的态度穿过小镇。驻扎在各大门的卫兵会注意到新面孔，但除非有理由，否则不会对那些他们不认识的人采取行动。",
								"镇上最大的客栈--闪亮河酒馆，是达格福特第二大建筑，也是当地许多庆祝活动和聚会的场所。在这里，富人会来吃饭和放松。这家客栈很古老，许多当地人声称它甚至比公爵城堡还要古老，对许多人来说，它是达格福的灵魂。银色洪水旅馆和蜥蜴之胗也提供房间，尽管后者没有食物提供给客人，只有床。",
								"Daggerford最不寻常的业务之一是剑岸商人银行，它接受旅行商人的存款，并使他们能够在Waterdeep或Baldur's Gate的一个类似地点收到这些资金。贝琳达-安特欧斯女士（沃特迪普贵族家族）承诺她的生意是安全的，银行在城市间传递精确货币数量的神奇手段是无法被篡改的。",
								"在镇外做生意的当地行会成员并不完全信任商人银行，而是更愿意从经营快乐牛酒馆的半身人哈德奇斯家族那里借钱。联盟官方并无偏好，但我发现安特奥斯女士值得信赖，足以成为携带大笔资金上路的一个选择。与其在荒野的旅途中被一伙强盗夺走所有的东西，不如把钱包里的一小部分分出来。",
								"建议来到达格福的游客避开西边的制革厂，并在从南边来的时候迅速穿过丁达尔桥。制革厂的位置在山上，几乎无法抑制制革过程中的臭味，而水手公会则将城市的垃圾倾倒在桥的一侧。在炎热的日子里，这两个地方散发的气味会让人难以忍受，这就是为什么我再次要求联盟指派一名不同的代理人在明年夏天的巡视中访问。",
								"丁达尔桥是一个低矮的石头结构，旅行者从西边走过来时都要经过这个桥。当地一个叫丁达尔的男孩在那里只用一把匕首就挡住了许多蜥蜴人。他长大成人，娶了当地统治者的女儿，自封为公爵，并在一座古老城堡的废墟上建造了Daggerford。这个故事，以及这个地区的大部分历史，都由达尔芬-弗洛辛爵士愉快地告诉任何询问的人，他是一个比达格福特本身更古老的精灵。他渴望看到人类、矮人和精灵之间的合作在这个地区的兴起，就像曾经体现在Phalorm王国中的那样。多年来，Darfin一直是Daggerford的许多公爵的顾问。虽然他在马尔德温公爵统治期间被他回绝了，但有迹象表明，莫文夫人可能更容易接受一个金精灵的建议，他见证了人类王国德林拜伦的衰落、达格福的建立，以及此后的所有日子。"

								"长鞍村只不过是长路两边的一排建筑，在从特里波尔到米拉巴尔的漫长旅程的中途。一条小路在这里离开公路，蜿蜒至常春藤大厦，这是哈佩尔家族的巫师的大房子。自从哈佩尔家族在四个多世纪前建立这个小镇以来，他们几乎没有容忍过任何胡言乱语，更没有容忍过混乱。他们自己的行为有时近乎怪异，而且可能令人不安--他们曾经把两个敌对的马拉里派教徒变成了兔子，因为他们的争吵扰乱了龙鞍，使他们不得不听从他们所尊敬的掠食者的摆布--但他们是北方任何地方最有力的法师聚会之一。",
								"哈珀尔家族是一个欢快的，甚至是孤僻的群体。他们都是巫师，也倾向于与巫师结婚，家族中的长者（通过血缘或婚姻）为家族设定了方向，并完全统治了常春藤大厦内的事务。该家族招收了一些巫师学徒，用他们来做一些琐碎的工作，以及对长沙的基本防御。一些学徒往往是实验性法术的无心试验对象，但这就是向哈珀尔家族学徒的危险。很可能正是这种实验精神导致哈佩尔人在远离其他定居点的地方建立了他们的城镇。肢体大小或形状奇特、头发颜色怪异或形态多变的年轻巫师在龙鞍镇相当常见，对当地人来说并不奇怪，但他们可能会让游客感到不安。",
								"鉴于哈佩尔人作为强大的巫师的名声，以及他们的数量，不乏有民间人士在龙鞍和附近的土地上打探，希望发现像儿童宝藏一样藏匿的魔法。当然，这样的包袱即使有也是少之又少，但当地人不乏娱乐活动，让那些可能的小偷大肆追逐魔杖、戒指和其他魔法饰品，而任何谨慎的人都会意识到这些东西根本不存在。毕竟，如果Longsaddle的普通商人知道强大的魔法在哪里，他就会更有可能在这些年里试图索取它。",
								"Longsaddle的主要业务是放牧，村子周围的土地被数以百计的各种类型和规模的牧场和农场所占据，从小小的马场到大片的牛场。在牲畜被运来交易的那些日子里，Longsaddle是一个尘土飞扬、充满噪音的地方，动物的声音与希望出售货物的农民的喊叫声相互竞争。",
								"在其他时候，这里是一个安静的、几乎令人昏昏欲睡的小村庄，除非是哈珀尔制作的咒语的轰鸣回响打破了这种寂静。该家族不断研究新旧魔法，并将咒语和仪式扭曲成有趣的（对他们来说）创新。这种癖好促使他们在常春藤大厦周围设置了家族所能容纳的尽可能多的魔法屏障，以保护民众不受错误的爆炸、可怕的幻觉或奇怪的、飞驰而过的闪电之马的影响。",
								"有几家旨在吸引旅行者的企业矗立在龙鞍镇，如果没有其他原因的话，沿着名字好听的长路旅行会让人感到厌烦。首先是镀金马蹄铁，这是一家位于路西的古老旅馆，提供精美的食物和饮料，提供舒适的床铺，而且离常春藤大厦足够近，没有人敢打扰它或它的客人。店主可以获得龙须沟一些最优质的肉类，因此，他们的烤肉和炖肉都非常精致。",
								"在马路对面，奥斯特弗家族是当地的屠宰商和屠夫，为希望从龙须沟带走肉类而不是活体动物的人们服务。有传言说，这些年来，香肠的质量有了很大的提高，但当地人建议买主 \"注意牙齿\"，这指的是一个古老的笑话，但没有人记得。愿意等待的人可以让奥斯特夫家的能手为他们进行宰杀、悬挂、穿衣和包装，尽管这个过程可能要比大多数旅行者的时间长几天。",
								"在赌神那里有娱乐活动，在纸牌或骰子游戏中作弊的人被扔到街上，而当地一种被称为散弹的弹珠游戏也很受欢迎。其他一些商店还提供干货、蜡烛、灯笼、马鞍、绳子和马车车轮。",
								"怎么强调都不为过的是，虽然哈珀尔家族对龙须沟的日常运作兴趣不大，但不可否认的是，这是他们的城镇。他们很少受到侮辱，也从不容忍针对他们自己、他们的家人或当地人的暴力。涉及哈佩尔人的冲突很可能迅速而血腥地结束，而且（除非犯罪者令人信服地道歉、昏迷、死亡或被原谅了错误行为）往往会吸引更多的哈佩尔人来支持他们的亲属。哈珀尔在所有公共事务中都支持哈珀尔，没有人愿意记录那些忘记这一事实的人数和名字。",
								"除了哈佩尔家族之外，龙萨德的主要家族都是牧场主：卡德拉斯兹、埃默特、克罗姆勒、马姆拉、沙恩斯盾、苏尔迪弗和泽罗尔戈斯家族世代在龙萨德或附近从事牧场经营，并影响着那里大部分的日常生活。他们确定集市日，帮助解决家庭之间的纠纷，并在农民或商人死后没有继承人的情况下充当购买的中介。他们尽可能地解决小事并维持和平，他们清楚地知道，如果哈珀尔家族需要介入争端，总有可能将犯罪者炸成一片虚无。",
								"这些家族也是最有可能雇佣外人来处理牧场事务的家族，无论是兽人的突袭还是该地区出现的狼人（尽管有传言说后一种生物可能是哈珀尔家族的后代）。主要的牧场利益集团经常雇用冒险者，不仅是为了促进他们自己的目标或提供防御，而且是为了秘密地阻碍或伤害对方，在他们正在进行的竞争中获得优势。在这种任务中走得太远的冒险者可以被解释为愚蠢的外乡人，如果他们得罪了哈佩尔，在低级道路中间被炸死，就没有人可以询问此事了。我最好的建议是注意空气中的魔法气味并采取相应的行动。"

								"很久以前，伟大的矮人王国Gharraghaur矗立在Delzoun的西部，在Mirar河附近挖掘矿藏，发现了巨大的、近乎无尽的宝石矿脉。就像许多矮人王国一样，加拉豪尔落入了掠夺性的兽人手中，他们摧毁了王国和首都，却无法利用其中的财富。几千年来，下层城市一直空荡荡的，直到大约八百年前，安恩的王子埃瑞斯卡斯在同一地点定居，建立了米拉巴尔城（巧合的是，这与整个北方的矮人\"-巴 \"的命名惯例相呼应）。只有当矮人回到下面的矿场工作时，米拉巴尔才开始看到它的财富增长。",
								"米拉巴尔由其世袭酋长塞林-劳瑞姆（Selin Raurym）统治，他发布由闪光石议会提供给他的法令。议会是由矮人和少数人类组成的团体，他们被选举出来为城市制定政策，决定米拉巴尔的矿场的产出将被卖到哪里。虽然理事会长期以来一直让米拉巴尔与领主联盟保持联系，但与领主同伴谈判的是马奇恩。到目前为止，塞林-劳瑞姆已经证明在为城市做出有益的决定方面比他的前任要强得多，议会也给了他很大的余地在城墙外为米拉巴尔说话。在联盟未能帮助北方城市对抗最近的兽人群之后，他威胁要退出联盟，虽然有些人认为这是一个空洞的姿态，但却为米拉巴尔带来了与水底城和博德之门更有利的关系，这一点并没有得到议会的赞赏。",
								"城市的卫队，米拉巴尔之斧，主要是为了阻止和防止对矿场的破坏，没有它，米拉巴尔将崩溃。警卫队还在城市内提供迅速而有力的防御和执法。米拉巴尔的财富是如此之大，以至于它在剑海的许多岛屿上都有码头、船只和坚固的港口，因此，该城市一直在为这些防御措施寻求魔法和军事支持。其他城市可能会将米拉巴尔拥有的如此庞大的硬币山用于显示繁荣，而米拉巴尔人则将其用于更多的功能目标，确保城市的防御系统是新的，其大门在移动时能安全地关闭，其建筑和墙壁是坚固和安全的。鉴于桑达巴尔的地面城市最近被兽人军队摧毁，这种支出是合理的，因为米拉巴尔没有人希望看到地面城市被消灭。这对商业来说是很不利的。米拉巴尔不遗余力地捍卫自己的财富，并在必要时雇佣尽可能多的法师和冒险家来清除道路上的威胁，调查破坏行为，并以其他方式保护其重要贸易。",
								"随着Mithral Hall在上个世纪的崛起，以及现在Gauntlgrym的出现，Mirabar担心它作为北方军械库的地位会受到威胁。米拉巴尔的矿工、冶炼师和铁匠们更加努力地工作，以提高他们的产量和改进他们的工艺，而珠宝商和珐琅师则研究如何在他们的作品中融入古老的技术，将矮人、人类和精灵的设计融合在一起，就像古老的法隆一样。",
								"米拉巴伦（或对一些人来说，只是米尔伦）矮人喜欢培养长而宽（而不是锥形或尖形）的胡须，以及在下巴以外的其他地方生长的紧身辫子，这种时尚被一些当地人类所模仿。他们喜欢抛光的、经过常亮处理的金属片，特别是铜片，用作门或镜子般的墙板镶嵌。他们经常在工具和武器的鞍座和非工作端镶嵌宝石。米尔伦矮人往往很富有，拥有不寻常的稀有宝石的个人收藏，使用宝石雕刻成的印记，并且是剑海岸上下的企业（而不是财产）的投资者。他们成熟而世故，他们谴责某些矮人的孤立主义和排外主义态度。米尔伦矮人通过在火星和永夜以及其他任何他们能够以蠕虫方式进入的地方，在矮人之间以及矮人和非矮人之间成为商标和协议的外交商人和权力经纪人，来证明他们自己更广泛的态度。",
								"对于其他矮人来说，米伦是翻译和当地向导，以及在剑海岸和心脏地带大部分地区的人类主导的城市中 \"认识正确的人 \"的人。大多数成年的米伦人都与各种人类造价师和商人打交道，注意避免排他性或培养范围过窄的商业伙伴和联系人，因此他们控制着自己的命运和财富。他们憎恨人类有丝毫支配他们的机会的想法。",
								"流经米拉巴尔的财富不仅扩大了所有米勒人的影响力和世俗知识，还使他们能够沉迷于各种个人爱好，如艺术收藏（尤其是雕像和绘画）。大多数米伦人的私人生活区都有舒适的家具、大大小小的绘画艺术品、雕像和悬挂的风铃--通常是金属的，但总是柔和宜人，从不喧哗或刺耳。宝石在米尔伦家庭中非常多，被用作货币和各种个人装饰品，而不是被藏起来。米拉巴尔的许多街道上都有半宝石，华丽的镶嵌物标志着重要的角落和交叉口，有些是如此新，以至于人们还能闻到珠宝商的灰尘。",
								"然而，尽管这个城市总体上很富裕，但还是有富裕的和（相对）贫穷的米拉巴兰人。不是每个人都能分享城市销售带来的钱财，那些收入由一天的劳动或一个月的产出决定的工薪族，不能指望雇主的一份措辞得当的合同能使他们获得丝毫的财富。富裕的商人和企业主都小心翼翼地避免炫耀他们的成功；他们的衣服可能是更丰富的面料，但仍然是与穷人的服装一样的款式和颜色。富人家的候车室和前厅与穷人家的候车室和前厅一样，都是家具稀少的。保持财富相对平等的外观是至关重要的，因为如果任何有能力实施暴力行为的人--例如，能够获得大量剑和斧头的武器制造商--知道最富有的米拉巴兰人是多么富有，在被冒犯的各方得到满足之前，很可能会发生流血事件。",

								"自从达古特-纽伦堡被废黜为沃特德普的公开领主后，他就把全部的注意力和精力都放在了重建这个他自称有血统的城市。无论人们对他在永夜的王位有什么看法，在过去的几年里，他已经被证明是一个有能力的、鼓舞人心的领导者，人们也拥护他成为保护者。他设计了鸿沟的封印和大道的恢复，并正在寻求其他方法来修复和改善城市。即使他无法证明自己是纳舍-阿拉贡达大人的后裔，永夜城的人们也接受了他的领导。(传闻中我对永夜城主的个人厌恶与我对他的领导力的评价无关，我只是觉得他是个令人无法容忍的花花公子。)",

								"越来越多的市民要求将执法者从敏塔恩（Mintarn）调走，由值得尊敬的、对保卫永冬有个人兴趣的当地卫兵取代。这种公众情绪导致一些社区组织了自己的临时民兵，而保护者大人希望避免他们与他所雇佣的雇佣兵之间发生冲突。因此，纽伦堡一直在慢慢减少来自敏塔恩的士兵数量，因为那些在保护临时长城免受鸿沟威胁中长大的公民证明自己有能力成为一支合适的军事力量。博德之门（Baldur's Gate）和沃特德普（Waterdeep）都表示愿意帮助训练永夜城的新守卫，但永夜城主更喜欢经验丰富的冒险家的帮助，而不是向他以前的城市寻求帮助的耻辱。",
								"随着附近Gauntlgrym的恢复，Neverwinter希望能有一个亲密的盟友，为它提供坚固的盔甲和强大的武器。虽然这个城市目前没有什么可提供的东西，但贸易活动在永夜迅速增长，因为它的重生让它向来自剑海的航运、北方的货物和南方的硬币开放。冒险家们来到永夜城寻找工作，并听从附近宝藏的传言，他们经常找到额外的工作来清理城市的危险角落，并护送越来越多的商队在公路上来回穿梭。守护者大人希望，随着商业和收入的增加，以及有天赋的手工艺人回到他们的行业，永温特有一天会再次配得上它以前的称号：巧手之城。",
								"对Neverember的权威的反对仍然存在，但由于没有统一的领导，在城市中也没有其他的力量可以呼吁，叛军正在慢慢地从他们的抵抗中转向帮助城市的重建。许多阿拉贡达之子（Sons of Alagondar），一个最初反对纽伦堡勋爵的反叛组织，已经开始自愿替代目前在城市里巡逻的明塔恩雇佣兵。如果阿拉贡达之子能够与他的目标保持一致，纽文伯希望利用这一成就来吸引富裕的沃特达威贵族--他们不愿意将自己的财富与一个实际上被流放出沃特德普的失败的开放领主联系在一起--来投资这座城市，也许可以重建该地区的一些贵族别墅，作为他们做生意时的住处。",
								"随着鸿沟的关闭，将城市其他地方与恐怖之地隔开的墙现在被拆毁了，永夜城的大片土地空空如也，没有居民，有的是从整个城市的废墟中掠夺来的大块石头。任何愿意这样做的人都可以来到这个地区，拥有一部分土地，并建造一个可以居住或工作的建筑。这里还没有任何行会来限制贸易或建筑，也没有任何贵族需要被请愿或安抚。那些想要建立一个家或开始一个生意的人可以简单地这样做，甚至那些没有技能或金钱的人可以用他们的手和背来提供，直到他们能够为自己建立一个地方。",
								"沿着河边，许多商人的别墅都被那些听说过永夜曾经是什么，并可能再次成为什么的传闻的人认领和修复。有些人没有任何技能可言，许多人也没有财富，但他们都有工作的愿望，并希望在这个过程中充实自己。新的商店和工场按天开张，没有受过训练的工人提供他们的服务，成为工人或学徒；那些失败的人利用这个城市现在提供的大量机会，转而从事其他工作。那些没有其他选择的人可以为保护者大人疏浚或绘制城市的下水道，这项任务是由造成鸿沟的大灾难所引起的。",
								"和其他城市一样，永夜城也不是没有缺点的。虽然大多数人都愿意工作，但有些人以偷窃为生，并掠夺那些没有什么可拿的东西。由于旅馆和酒馆低估了他们将接待的客人的数量，或者商人根本没有货物可卖，所以食物有时会很稀缺。在这个城市完全摆脱这些弊病之前，可能还需要几年的时间，但对一些人来说，永夜城生活的不确定性使这个地方变得令人兴奋。对于许多商人来说，特别是那些生产或销售城市所需的谷物和蔬菜的人来说，这是一个巨大的机会，既可以帮助一个新生的势力，又可以在此过程中获得相当的财富。"

								"在城市的东部是高级宫殿，它是城市和堕落的鲁鲁尔国的首都。梅特拉姆-艾拉苏梅勋爵住在这座高大、细长的建筑里。它的垛口的梅龙雕刻得很像独角兽的头。穿着闪亮的银色盔甲的高级卫队士兵，保护着这座住宅和权力的所在地，并将那些没有业务的人挡在外面。",
								"银月城长期以来一直由一位高级法师领导。其中执政时间最长的，当然也是最有影响力的，Alustriel Silverhand，一百多年前卸任，成为鲁鲁尔的高级夫人，由Taern Hornblade接任。虽然他在过去的一个世纪里进行了明智的统治，但Taern最近将城市的领导权交给了高级元帅Methrammar Aerasumé，Alustriel的半精灵儿子和Silverymoon武装力量的领导者。泰恩仍然在领主联盟的会议上代表梅特拉姆为城市说话，因为这位新统治者太过直率和急躁，不适合契约的其他领主。",
								"银月城由几支部队保卫。首先是银色骑士团，他们是在城市和附近土地上巡逻的闪亮的盔甲战士。骑士团的军官们在战术和军事历史方面训练有素，对自己和战友的能力有很高的评价--这些评价往往被证实了。他们得到法术护卫队的支持，这是一支由强大的魔法师和巫师组成的队伍，他们在战斗中接受魔法训练。最后是这个城市自己的神话，巨大的魔法力量领域阻止了城市居民从事各种形式的法术表演。特别是，召唤火焰、召唤生物或允许传送的法术在其目标处于神域范围内时都会失败。如果有敌人试图穿越月桥，这个跨度可以被（由城市的统治者，以及其他一些特别适应神话的人）控制住，把攻击者丢进河里。",
								"没有哪个城市的威望比银月城的威望在最近的战争和随后银色地带的瓦解中受到的伤害更大。尽管Silvaeren试图支持附近的城市，但他们被指责为对Sundabar提供了不充分和无能的支持，其地表人口被完全消灭了。最后，所有的矮人国家都退出了鲁鲁修，没有这些王国的支持，也没有阿鲁斯特里尔在成立时提供的领导，联盟崩溃了。泰恩-霍恩布雷德在领主联盟中的话语权也不像阿鲁斯特里尔那样强大，部分原因是他对前大夫人的感情和尊重在很大程度上已经延伸到她的妹妹拉伊尔，现在是水底世界的公开领主。",
								"尽管有报道说她几十年前就死了，但最近有传言说，Alustriel大夫人实际上还活着，并在南方的土地上活动。看起来，她既没有联系过她的儿子，也没有联系过她以前的战友泰恩-霍恩布拉德--尽管考虑到泰恩对大夫人无望的爱是多么广为人知，而且他花了很长时间来克服他的悲痛，不确定他在收到她生存的证据后会有什么反应。",
								"尽管如此，银月城长期以来一直被称为北方哈珀人的安全避难所，因为该城不认为联盟的目标与哈珀人有冲突。其他城市的统治者可能会把哈珀人的存在视为对他们权威的威胁，而银月城则像哈珀人一样热切地渴望结束暴政，因此更多的利益得到了满足。同时，一些Silvaeren认为，该城市对联盟中某些其他成员（有人提到米拉巴尔，有人提到博德之门）的宽容有些天真。"

								"现在，辉煌之城正在恢复中。港口已经清除了组成前Mistshore区的破船，沃特德普又有了自己的海军。城市的卫队（军队）、守望（警察部队）、海军和著名的狮鹫骑兵都在进行改革，但所有这些都可能是几年后的事。一场瘟疫将大多数居民赶出了沃伦和唐沙德，除了那些被领主授权的人，在城市表面以下生活或挖掘被视为非法。不知何故，连空气都显得更加清新。用一位睿智的月精灵族长的话说（她作为我姑姑的身份与她的智慧毫无关系），\"沃特德普又回到了我还是小姑娘时的样子。\"",
								"在最新的发展中，也许最令人惊讶的是拉伊尔-银手（Laeral Silverhand）回到了水底世界。长期以来，人们一直认为她已经死了，直到最近她才重新出现，并迅速召集了蒙面领主支持她取代达古特-纽伦堡成为水底城的公开领主。很少有人记得莱拉尔女士以前在这个城市的时候，但那些在过去一个世纪里一直生活在那里的精灵们声称她比以前更保守了。这位新的开放领主不谈论她的家庭--只要提到她的孩子、她已故的丈夫（传说中的黑杖，Khelben Arunsun），或者她任何一位著名的姐妹，她就会打断当时可能正在进行的任何谈话。她与现任黑袍人瓦杰拉-萨法尔的关系很融洽，但两人很少在一对一的谈话中出现，大多数人认为拉伊尔夫人没有什么可以从一个几乎与她不相上下的法师那里学到。",
								"像往常一样，公开的领主是由几个戴面具的领主挑选和支持的，他们带着面具、长袍和护身符，在公开坐镇审判或议会时伪装自己，并为水底城制定政策。每个沃特德人都会怀疑这个或那个有影响力的公民是否是城市的领主，有些人愿意将他们的信念公之于众，但以这种方式面对的人，很少有人声称自己是领主，那些人也没有拿出证据来证明这种说法。",
								"毫不掩饰的是城市的其他领主--沃特迪普的贵族们，他们的高调行为和大手笔的消费在城市中建立了时尚，这反过来又为整个北方的服装、武器、受宠的饰品、音乐以及其他任何可以被那些有足够的钱财来支付费用的人随意改变的偏好创造了潮流。超过75个贵族家庭以沃特德为家，他们之间代表着各种商业利益、竞争和内部纷争。",
								"作为一个贵族，有很大的优势。在经济和社会等级制度的领导下，贵族可以轻易地把一个平庸的手艺人从默默无闻中拉出来，使一个富有的商人在城市中获得另一份合同的希望破灭，或者为一个雄心勃勃的冒险团提供寻找名声和巨大财富所需的支持。贵族们面临的唯一真正的竞争是来自彼此。这种竞争是许多流言蜚语和阴谋的来源，因为沃特德普的贵族们总是试图在他们的争吵中至少保持一种文明的表面形象。",
								"虽然他们很少达成一致意见，但所有贵族家族都有一个共同点，那就是他们的地位不应受到新人的玷污，当然也不能被任何如此光明正大的人以购买方式获得贵族头衔。在Neverember勋爵的任期内，当贫穷的家族可以出售他们的头衔，从而允许其他人成为贵族时，许多旧血统家族的领导人感到震惊，特别是在一些购买者失去了他们所有的硬币并在一两个赛季内再次出售他们的头衔之后。令这些领导人欣慰的是，开放领主拉拉尔-银手（Laeral Silverhand）看到了这一决定的愚蠢之处，并在水底城的领主中聚集了足够的支持，不仅推翻了这一决定，还将头衔和土地恢复给那些因愚蠢而失去它们的贵族家庭。这一改变为她在贵族中赢得了很多支持。现在，Zhents和Thayans以及Baldurian商人有足够的硬币在城市内购买房产，如果他们选择的话，但这并不是授予他们贵族头衔和合法权利的理由，而不仅仅是一座豪宅。",

								"每年夏天，除了在Shieldmeet发生的年份，亚尔塔都会举行一个大型的雇佣交易会，期间，各种不良的民俗都会聚集在镇子的北部，寻找警卫、矿工、农场工人、导游或其他非技术工人的工作。在大多数情况下，参加这个集市的人都是野蛮人、强盗、土地无法继续维持的自由人，或者希望在 \"文明 \"人中待上一段时间的乌斯加德人，但偶尔也能从这群人中挖出一个强壮的人或一个熟练的战士。当这种情况发生时，雅尔塔就会有很多它不欢迎的访客，他们偷东西，在街上卖东西（有时是他们刚偷来的东西），遇到不择手段的人交出钱币、信息或偷来的物品，并偶尔进行法术决斗。在这些集市上，当那些因为有合法技能可以出售而从人群中脱颖而出的人相互吸引并决定组成一个团体时，新的冒险公司就会出现，这很常见。",
								"在Shieldmeet落下的那些年里，小镇在这一天反而会迎来一个盛大的节日，主要是由当地的Tymora神庙--幸运的幸福殿堂赞助。Shieldmeet节的特点是有许多机会、技巧和勇敢的游戏，从骰子和飞镖，到醉酒跑步，到摔跤和其他身体竞赛。偶尔，泰莫拉的祭司们会利用这个节日来确认那些被女神召唤去完成特定任务的冒险者，被选中接受祝福的冒险者，或者以其他方式为某些未确定的命运做标记。",
								"无论是在招聘会还是在Shieldmeet节期间，每年夏天似乎都有至少一支冒险乐队在雅尔塔起步。大多数人都默默无闻，但 \"微笑团\"--近十年前聚集在雅尔塔的一支更大的勇士队伍中仍然活跃的部分--仍然享有适度的成功，并且每年为快乐大厅做出贡献。",
								"雅尔塔的统治者是一位终身当选的水霸。现任水龙是内斯特拉-鲁西奥（Nestra Ruthiol），一个脾气暴躁、诡计多端的女人；虽然她说话和侮辱都很随意，但她很少对对手采取行动，除非她确信这样做可以达到最有效的痛苦效果。在我上次访问雅尔塔期间，有人指责水巴伦谋杀了一个男人，凯德-帕里尔，后来发现他是她的情人。他的尸体在河里被发现，还有被浸湿的似乎是内斯特拉-鲁特希尔最喜欢的斗篷的残余物。在指控曝光前不久，她与帕里尔的妻子蒂亚什大声公开争吵，这对她的声誉或她的清白印象没有什么帮助。当她最终被洗清罪名时，水巴伦-鲁特希尔明确表示，她不想再提这件事，而且她会确保任何在官方交易中提起此事的人都会对结果感到相当不满。虽然有窃窃私语，但此后在她面前再也没有人提及此事。有些人把谋杀归咎于当地的盗贼行会Yartar之手，但我相信凯德洛德被杀，而水霸被牵连进来，是为了给她在城内的一个对手腾出职位。",
								"正是这样的冲突和计划使雅尔塔无法在北方获得显赫地位。如果该镇能够克服内部问题，利用领主联盟的伙伴们所能提供的优势，并找到一种方法，从其主要贸易路线的位置上获得更大的利润--它是通往东北所有定居点的门户--雅尔塔可能很快就会在规模、财富和影响力上有所增长。实际的增长需要为进一步的定居开辟地形，并建立另一个包围墙来保护定居者--以及雇用更多的卫兵来保护那些工作的人。",
								"雅尔塔是一个渔业镇，它的位置靠近两条大河，并且靠近第三条大河（笑流河，形成一个三人组，当地人创造性地称之为三河），每餐都有鱼作为食物。新鲜的螃蟹、鳗鱼和其他河流生物既可以吃也可以买，是该镇渔民的主要收入来源。",
								"雅尔塔的另一个主要产业是驳船制造。该地区的大部分河道驳船都是在雅尔塔建造的，或者至少是在雅尔塔开始使用的，该镇的驳船工匠的作品在德萨林河及其支流上都很有名。正是由于雅尔塔的驳船对北方商业的重要性，使该镇在领主联盟中获得了一席之地，以确保雅尔塔不会落入敌人手中，造成沿河贸易网络的动荡。",
								"不能用驳船运进或运出亚尔塔的东西就用商队来代替，这个镇子的位置使它成为大多数商队在水底城和银月城之间的关键一站。在雅尔塔，商队可以安排快速维修，更换马车车轮、马车或整个马车，或补充马具和其他配件。",
								"由于雅尔塔的产业太少，近邻也少，所以它的商人们经常彼此直接竞争，既没有资源去寻找新客户，也没有空间或资金去探索新的行业。因此，雅尔塔的很多流言蜚语、小偷小摸和袭击事件的根源是一个商人试图在对手面前占上风，要么通过损坏货物、恐吓工人，要么偷窃顾客和客户。",
								"为了抑制和控制喧嚣，水巴伦雇佣了雅尔塔的盾牌，这是一支骑兵部队，负责镇上的治安，维持秩序，并驱赶偶尔威胁附近土地的乌斯加德人的袭击。盾牌被安置在盾牌塔中，这是一个位于苏尔布林河西岸的防御性建筑（该镇主要位于东部），其外墙经常被拆毁和重建。有传言说，当未经授权的人踏上城墙之间的土地时，守护者的骷髅就会升起，但没有人测试过该地区的魔法是否仍在发挥作用；即使没有，一百多个愤怒的战士从塔中冲出，向闯入者冲去，也足以将人们吓得不敢再追问。一座坚固的桥连接着塔和城镇之间的河岸。",
								"比盾牌或盾牌塔更令人印象深刻的是水霸的驳船。这艘巨大的船只可以装载两百名士兵或七十五名雅尔塔的盾牌和他们的马匹。它在水线以上的两侧都装上了铁甲。船壁后面有多个弩炮装置，每个都能同时发射一打弩箭。当与河岸上的部队对峙时，盾牌兵会对他们的敌人进行两轮射击，然后把驳船带上岸，进行冲锋。没有一个突击队员能在这样的攻击下站稳脚跟。",
								"在城镇的中心是水巴伦的大厅，这是一个宏伟的建筑，既是统治者的家，也是她听取意见的地方。宴会经常在这里举行，但更多时候，大厅的活动是在它的侧室进行的，在那里，交易大量货物的商人，或进行影响整个社区的交易和建议的商人，可以舒适地会面。",

								"在法鲁恩的最北端，靠近寒冰森林的地方，是冰山。在那里，在严寒中，矗立着永恒的堡垒--阿德巴城堡，这是北境的最后一个伟大的遗迹，也是堕落的德尔祖恩的荣耀。近十八个世纪以来，阿德巴一直坚强地抵御着来自每一个敌人的威胁，并坚守着，令其居民和整个地区的人民感到非常自豪。",
								"从表面上看，阿德巴城堡不像是一座城堡或人类城市，而像是一座为满足居住在那里的矮人的目的而雕刻的山。矗立在最上面的两座大塔被凶恶的龙刺环抱着，以防止大型生物登陆后直接攻击这些建筑。城市中央铸造厂的大烟囱矗立在它们之间，喷出的烟雾就像一座即将喷发的火山。环绕着城堡的是大量的平台、垛口和箭缝，防御者可以从那里向任何愚蠢到攻击城市的人发射弩箭。",
								"几个世纪以来，阿德巴一直是北方王国的活招牌。当德尔祖恩帝国灭亡时，它已经是德尔祖恩的主要堡垒，随着其他定居点被兽人占领、被地精袭击，或者干脆消失，它对该地区的矮人的重要性才逐渐增加。希望攻占阿德巴城堡的兽人部落可能会对它的城墙大发雷霆，但收效甚微，直到巨大的、不屈不挠的花岗岩成为他们被砸碎的砧板。巨大的吊桥允许任何人通过，除了受欢迎的客人，而这样的客人确实很少。它屹立不倒，是矮人希望、荣耀和贸易的堡垒。",
								"但现在，在记忆中第一次，我的阿德巴兰同胞们似乎真的对向任何外人开放城堡的前景感到害怕。也许他们是对最近的战争损失的反应，或者是我们的新国王表现出的缺乏领导力，或者仅仅是对战争的厌倦，但不管是什么原因，阿德巴的大门比过去更难用柔和的语言来移动，而且现在从城里出来的商人也越来越少。",
								"最近的兽人战争让王国损失惨重，无论是战士还是领导层。在很短的时间内，我们长期执政的国王哈布罗姆就死了。他毫无准备的双胞胎儿子分享了统治权，直到大儿子布罗姆自己被龙杀死，留下年轻的国王哈诺特统治这座古老的城堡。",
								"接下来是王国的一次大出血。要想让北境摆脱多箭兽人的巨大围困，需要很多东西。也有传言说，哈诺斯国王率领他的米特拉之盾骑士出征，在不明智的攻击中向兽人发泄他的愤怒和悲痛，将曾经伟大的骑士们削弱到不足二十人。铁卫军，阿德巴的军队，看起来和以前一样强大，但考虑到对兽人的损失程度，如果他们的新兵更多的是铁匠而不是战士，出于责任感而不是对战斗的渴望为他们的王国服务，那就没什么好奇怪的了。我在近卫军中服役了一个世纪，但我还没有测试过新人，看看他们到底是什么做的。",
								"如果你有幸获准进入阿德巴，要警惕自己四处走动。在堡垒内的各个地方都有陷阱、死亡陷阱和其他危险，等待着有人错误地接近受保护的地点。如果你能找到一个向导，对于新来的人来说，要想安全地走动，就必须有一个向导。",
								"在城堡的正下方，数英里长的矮人大小的洞穴形成了一个混乱的迷宫，让大多数非矮人游客感到沮丧。这些隧道是山中早期采矿工作的遗迹。在它们下面是今天的大矿场，不断有工程师和工人在那里工作。",
								"根据法律规定，矿场禁止访客--甚至是非阿德巴兰矮人--除非在非常紧急的时候。因此，鉴于要塞坚不可摧的性质，非阿德巴的人还没有特权目睹下面发生的事情。城堡的大转轮，即使对矮人来说也是一个最令人印象深刻的景象，它是一个不断转动的水轮，为阿德巴的铸造厂、矿场和其他作业提供动力，使其随时都能运转。轮子附近是莫拉丁的锻造大厅，这是一个崇拜的地方，提醒每个矮人灵魂锻造师的力量和持久的保护。在它面前，人们不禁感到安全，一个真正的矮人在莫拉丁的温暖阴影下就是家。",
								"鉴于城堡周围地表土地的现状，阿德巴兰对通过地下通道进入城市的商队和游客比平时更加怀疑，这并不奇怪。有一条这样的道路从西边抵达，通过老德尔祖恩的古老隧道将阿德巴与米特拉尔厅和米拉巴尔连接起来。另一条隧道从阿德巴向南通向低路，低路连接着东部的阿斯科雷废墟和西部的费尔巴尔城堡。",
								"无论他们来自哪里，所有通往阿德巴的道路都会汇聚在一起，所以所有的旅行者都必须面对被称为商队之门的那对巨大的铁门。和阿德巴城的其他地方一样，这扇门从未被攻破过。如果你想找点乐子的话，可以向阿德巴兰的矮人提起这种想法。"

								"作为德尔祖恩最古老和最宏伟的领地之一，费尔巴尔城堡建于三千多年前--一个年轻种族无法理解的时间跨度。通过与尼瑟尔（Netheril）和北方一些古老的人类定居点进行有利可图的贸易，矮人获得了巨大的财富，为自己打造了一座强大的堡垒。",
								"像大多数矮人定居点一样，费尔巴兰是围绕着采矿而建立的。随着尼瑟尔的沦陷，低路贸易的减少，以及有迹象表明城市下面的矿场已经达到了它们的使用年限，费尔巴兰人在近两千年后放弃了这座城堡，此后不久银月城的一支部队占领了这座堡垒。在半个世纪内，兽人已经意识到了这个小得多的守卫部队的弱点，费尔巴兰在四个月的围攻后被野蛮人占领。兽人给这个地方起了他们的部落名称，而 \"多箭堡垒 \"作为兽人的堡垒存在了三百多年。",
								"费尔巴尔城堡最近的故事是我死去的朋友埃默勒斯-沃克伦国王的故事。在公元1367年，埃默鲁斯带领一支矮人部队抓住了优势，这时，令我们惊讶和高兴的是，另一个兽人部落袭击了多箭堡垒内的兽人。韬光养晦，直到入侵者攻破城门，埃默鲁斯征服了两个兽人部落，为矮人夺回了城堡。在经历了第一个残酷的冬天后，费尔巴尔城堡得以恢复：它的锻造厂重新点燃，矮人的锤子声再次开始响彻大厅。这是一个值得骄傲的时刻，我们迎来了下一个夏天，费尔巴尔重新回到了矮人手中。",
								"在最近的战争中，兽人再次占领了费尔巴尔城，但在布鲁诺-战锤国王和整个北方的矮人联盟的帮助下，埃默鲁斯国王再次夺回了费尔巴尔，杀死了所有设法进入城市和下面隧道的兽人。感激不尽的国王和他忠诚的战士们随后同意陪同布鲁诺去Gauntlgrym，并在那里协助他夺回那座古城，但埃默勒斯在这次行动中受了致命伤。布鲁诺为了纪念埃默鲁斯国王，任命他为恢复后的Gauntlgrym的第二任国王（在康纳德国王被追授第一任国王的荣誉之后），但对于大多数费尔巴兰矮人来说，这种荣誉是一种空洞的安慰，因为他们心爱的英雄国王已经被夺走了。",
								"现在统治Felbarr城堡的是Emerus国王的远房亲戚，Morinn国王和Tithmel王后，他们最近结婚，旨在将对王位的不同要求合并为一个家庭。Tithmel对王位的要求因一小部分亲属关系而更强烈，但Morinn是一个更安静、更有思想的统治者。蒂瑟尔女王一直是个战士，一些费尔巴兰人担心她会在这对夫妇为王国提供继承人之前一头撞上错误的战斗，因此他们希望莫林国王的柔和影响能帮助收敛她急躁的天性，使城市在最近的冲突之后的艰难时期保持强大。虽然两位君主共同统治着这座城市，并以绝对的权威说话，但他们的公民在决定如何对皇家法令采取行动之前，明智地听取了两人的意见。",
								"大多数人类从远处了解费尔巴尔城堡。他们只看到一条巨大的高架路，蜿蜒穿过破碎的岩石谷地，被两座被称为 \"锤子 \"和 \"铁砧 \"的防御工事守护着。另有两座工事在道路上方隐约可见，它们嵌在附近的悬崖上，建在悬崖之上。这两座防御工事是北面的守夜人和南面的守夜人。在它们的远处，巨大的符文门矗立在道路的尽头，是进入费尔巴的入口，但游客很少通过它。",
								"和大多数矮人城市一样，菲尔巴尔几乎完全存在于地下。然而，由于它曾不止一次地被兽人入侵，目前还没有关于城市内部全貌的准确地图，这使得潜在的攻击者无法获得他们的信息。矮人，即使是那些通过与低地的联系从其他王国来的矮人，在寻找他们的道路上也没有什么困难，但人类，特别是那些不能读懂矮人语或刻在整个城市的速记符文的人，则要困难得多。",
								"战争结束后，大多数费尔巴兰人对银色牧场的解体表示赞赏。在其最需要的时候，除了矮人之外，没有其他种族采取哪怕是最轻微的行动来援助费尔巴尔城，而更多的援助和更好的协调可能不仅会阻止该城池的陷落，也会阻止桑达巴尔的陷落。费尔巴兰的商人仍然愿意与北方的城市进行贸易，并在必要时援助其他矮人王国，但蒂瑟尔女王是否会考虑与人类结盟，就像创建鲁鲁尔的那个联盟一样，这是值得怀疑的，即使莫林国王可能会。",

								"Gauntlgrym有一段复杂而矛盾的历史，其主要内容取决于谁在讲述。人类有一个故事，是他们近年来所知道的，但对我们矮人来说，Gauntlgrym是一个古老的地方，在旧德尔祖恩最早的时候就作为一个矿场被挖掘。关于这座城市巨大的米塔尔门的各种神话一直存在，但在开始时，Gauntlgrym只是一个矿场。当他们钻得太深时，那里的矮人发现了一个伟大的火焰生物的存在，封住了矿井，然后离开了。后来，当人类乞求德尔祖恩矮人建造一个城市时，Gauntlgrym才出现了一个城市。它的出现是因为，这一次，矮人成功地驾驭了深处的原始火力，从而创造了大锻造炉，使城市成为可能。或者说，故事是这样的。",
								"尽管几个世纪以来，冒险家们进行了各种探索，但没有人真正找到这座古城，直到冈特格莱姆以前的居民的鬼魂开始召唤活着的矮人去寻找这座城市。有些人找到了，或者说试图找到。此后不久，兽人战争又开始了，几乎每个矮人的注意力都转向了现有的矮人家庭和这些地方现在面临的危险。渐渐地，随着兽人被击退，矮人城市重新得到保障，那些钻研者开始回忆起他们对祖先的承诺。此外，当战争结束时，米特拉尔厅的国王布鲁诺-战锤（Bruenor Battlehammer）承诺将带领矮人前往冈特格莱姆，为北方的矮人夺回它。",
								"经过激烈的战斗，才赶走了从下面夺取城市的生物，没有人很清楚，除了鸦人之外，还有谁或谁试图占领Gauntlgrym，但最终，矮人军队取得了胜利，Bruenor取得了胜利。费尔巴尔城堡的埃默鲁斯-华冠国王受了重伤，布鲁诺在他死前宣布他为Gauntlgrym的第二个国王。当亲爱的埃默鲁斯去世后，布鲁诺接管了Gauntlgrym的统治，再次放弃了Mithral Hall的领导权。",
								"有些人认为布鲁诺国王有意建立一个伟大的、恢复的德尔祖恩帝国，让整个北方的矮人--从铁匠铺到阿德巴和桑达巴--向他宣誓效忠。还有人担心他会惩罚那些没有为夺回冈特格莱姆的事业贡献战士的定居点，但这些人并不了解这位回归的国王。如果他想要一个重生的德尔祖恩，愿莫拉丁和他的孩子们赐予他正确的智慧和坚韧的意志。这是一个我不希望别人得到的王位。",
								"一个离永夜城和水底城等沿海强国如此之近的矮人城市的崛起，带来了它自己的特殊机会和担忧。当然，一旦他们的锻造厂正常运转，矮人就会出售类似于他们在旧戴尔松东部城市锻造的优秀作品的盔甲和武器，而这些商品可能会减少对更远的矮人定居点的商品需求。特别是，桑达巴尔担心它的武器在剑海岸一带将不再受到追捧，并正在向南寻找埃尔图加德和其他地方的新市场。",

Every portion of the city has a road or passageway that eventually leads back to this site, a vast cavern of crisscrossing walkways and great stairs. In its lowest levels, the Tabernacle holds the resting places of countless of Gauntlgrym's dead. Scholars have set about cataloging the lineages recorded here, to give King Bruenor a more complete picture of the bloodlines of the city, and to determine whether any of the living clans have relations or honored dead among those interred.",

Now the forge might be brought back to life again, and soon—the priests and spellcasters of the city are working on a means of containing the great heat emanating from the Fiery Pit where the being of pure flame is contained, to harness the unquenchable fire as the dwarves of old did.",

His descriptions of life in Ironmaster confirm much of what I've heard of the place, and so what I relate to you now is truth as solid as Moradin's anvil.",
								"The dwarves of Ironmaster don't want you there, and they want little from the wider world that their traders can't bring back for them. Approaches to the vale in which their city lies are clearly marked with the symbol of Ironmaster: an anvil on a diamond. Such a mark is your only warning, and those ignorant of its meaning court death at the hands of dwarf patrols that will attack any interlopers. Some innocents have been spared and turned back, but no one should rely on the mercy of a dwarf of Ironmaster.",
								"If you were to pass beyond the borders and into Ironmaster itself, you would behold one of the wonders of the world. The great Shaengarne river rushes through a deep canyon of rock and ice in a series of cascades and waterfalls, throwing up freezing froth as it bashes against massive spires of rock that rise from the riverbed. Ironmaster is built in these spires and into the walls of the canyon, the tunnels and towers strung together by high bridges and cliff-side walkways. To hear Storn talk of the place, you would think that dwarves scrabbling about at such heights through the open air was as normal as badgers in a burrow, but I don't mind saying I set aside my ale after he spoke of it.",
								"Ironmaster owes its existence to the restlessness of Ilgostrogue Sstar, who left Citadel Adbar long ago with nearly a quarter of the population of the Northkingdom, headed for what is now Mirabar. By all accounts he was mad, and hoped to extend a dwarven empire to the sea. Once there, and settled, he grew restless again, and headed farther west with his troop, finally settling his nerves in sight of the sea over the Shaengarne River. There the dwarf leader died, and his heir demanded that the folk that followed him build a settlement in tribute to Clanmaster Sstar's grand vision of a dwarven empire. The dwarves found extensive deposits of iron in the hills surrounding their valley, and so named their city Ironmaster.",
								"Ironmaster proved true to its name, and the dwarves have been tunneling out under to tundra for centuries, following the veins of metal. This brought them into contact with duergar of the Deepkingdom a generation back, and Ironmaster has been at war with them ever since. Storn was himself a veteran of many battles for tunnel territory, and despite being so young that not a hair of his beard was white, his knowledge of tunnel-fighting tactics rivaled my own.",
								"Their war with the duergar isn't Ironmaster's only secret, however. My friend Storn wielded two silvered axes, as befits any devote follower of Clangeddin Silverbeard, but when I returned to him an axe he had thrown in the heat of battle, I noted its remarkable weight, and Storn told me that the blade was not steel beneath, but adamantine. I questioned him more about this, and his readiness to tell me of its origin speaks to both the abundance of adamantine among the Ironmaster dwarves and of my friend's innocence about the wider world. Apparently, the dragon-worshiping humans of the distant island of Tuern have long given raw adamantite mined from their island to the smiths of Ironmaster, and they render finished works of adamantine back to the Northlanders in return. Of course, not all the adamantine makes it back to the Northlanders, but since the humans are ignorant of the means of forging adamantine, they are likely none the wiser. What a trove of arms and armor must lie hidden beyond Ironmaster's borders! Ah well, surely they put it to good use against the duergar.",

								"The ancestral home of Clan Battlehammer, Mithral Hall was a place of great potential wealth when it was founded in the days of Old Delzoun. Dwarves of Clan Battlehammer left Citadel Adbar, heading west in the hope of finding mithral deposits hidden in the southern spurs of the Spine of the World. These they found, and so began the delving of Mithral Hall, with Clan Ironshield founding Settlestone nearby as a means of buffering the market for the products of the hall's ore.",
								"Mithral Hall enjoyed centuries of profit before its delving permitted the shadow dragon, Shimmergloom, to break through into the world. A settlement of thousands was reduced to fewer than three hundred—all of them too young, too old, too weak, or too ill to fight—who fled to Settlestone. There, they waited for months for word from King Garumn that their lands were again safe. When messengers to the city didn't return, it was clear that Mithral Hall had been lost, and its dwarves headed north, first to Ironmaster, where they were treated with such distrust that they couldn't remain, and then to Icewind Dale.",
								"When Garumn's grandson, Bruenor, was old enough, and sure of his path, he gathered allies to retake his former homeland, and went on a great many adventures with the group later known as the Companions of the Hall. At the end, Bruenor slew the dragon Shimmergloom and reclaimed Mithral Hall for Clan Battlehammer after almost two centuries.",
								"After Bruenor regained the throne, his personal friends attracted some powerful enemies to Mithral Hall, including the drow of Menzoberranzan. This is one reason, his supporters claim, that the king abdicated in favor of his ancestor Gandalug Battlehammer: to protect the people from his personal enemies. Some of Bruenor's detractors claim it was wanderlust that made him leave, but none will bother (or dare) to ask him. In any case, when Gandalug died, Bruenor did his duty and resumed the throne.",
								"Before Bruenor died, he was instrumental in gaining dwarven support for the Treaty of Garumn's Gorge, which brought peace between the dwarves and the orc Kingdom of Many-Arrows. When the orcs, in time, broke their treaty and made war on the North, he returned from the dead almost as though he had been summoned to rally the dwarves to defend themselves and punish their enemies. Some say he delayed receiving the rewards of Moradin's own Dwarfhome to return and aid his fellows and kinsfolk. Such sacrifice, such loyalty, makes a dwarf king worthy of the crown.",
								"Bruenor Battlehammer, the Eighth and Tenth and Thirteen King of Mithral Hall, no longer leads Mithral Hall or the Battlehammer dwarves that live there. Since his return to life, he has refocused his attention on Gauntlgrym, and doesn't claim the kingship of his former home. Instead, the crown has been offered to General Dagnabbet Waybeard, granddaughter of Bruenor's ally, the great general Dagna.",
								"When last I visited Mithral Hall a few years ago, I passed through the rebuilt ruin of Settlestone, where a garrison of two hundred stands to protect the approach to the Mithral Hall. Once I reached the gates, the massive granite doors proved to be heavily guarded, and nearly impossible to open from the outside. Mithral Hall's defenders call themselves the Host of the Hall, a disciplined, well-armored cohort that is willing to defend the city to the last dwarf. The famed Gutbuster Brigade is part of the Host, battleragers who strike fear into any enemy intelligent enough to realize whom it is they face.",
								"Travelers allowed inside the city are housed in upperlevel guest chambers just inside the labyrinth of caverns known as the Maze. From there, paths lead down into the middle levels of the city, past its various furnaces, and onward to either the lower levels and deeper mines (where guests aren't permitted) or the undercity (where non-dwarf visitors are prohibited).",
								"Despite its recent reputation and the growing legend surrounding its most famous king, Mithral Hall is much more a mine than it is a city. Like most dwarven realms, it lost significant numbers to the orcs, and saw its population further depleted by Bruenor's quest for Gauntlgrym and the resulting permanent relocation of some of his people. As a result, Mithral Hall's numbers are sorely diminished at present, and it remains to be seen whether its fortunes will follow suit."

								"Like Mirabar, Sundabar was a dwarven settlement atop which a human city was built. Sundabar's recent fall should serve as an example to my fellow dwarves of what can happen when the balance of power shifts toward the surface and into human hands.",
								"The city is descended from the citadel of Sundbarr, a stronghold of Delzoun constructed two thousand years ago around a strange volcanic rift that would come to be known as the Everfire—a mystical source of endless heat for the city's smithies and foundries that allowed Sundabar to produce works of great wonder. Sundbarr was led by a Forgemaster, the smith most skilled at working with the Everfire. When one Forgemeaster died or another surpassed his or her ability, leadership of Sundbarr changed hands.",
								"So it was until the fleeing remnants of Ascalhorn were pursued to the citadel's doorstep some time later. Then the Forgemaster of Sundbarr aided the humans in fighting off the demons and other monsters that chased them. In recognition of a human saving his life during the fight, the Forgemaster permitted the refugees to settle on the surface, rather than forcing them to depart once the battle was done. The partnership that grew between dwarves and humans became renowned throughout the North, and the surface city of Sundabar was built up into a mighty fortress of commerce.",
								"However, as the humans flourished above, the dwarf population dwindled, and eventually the Forgemaster was overtaken in prestige and influence by the Ruling Master of Sundabar, who came to speak for the human guilds and merchants of the surface city. One such ruling master, Helm Dwarf-Friend, was so beloved and respected that his descendants were able to crown themselves kings, something no dwarf before or since has dared to do in Sundabar.",
								"King Firehelm, Helm's grandson, was the king in Sundabar when the city fell to the orc horde. He did not survive. Beyond that tragedy, the recent war did horrific damage to Sundabar and the humans on the surface. A dragon dropped great stones on many of the buildings above, and a good portion of the city's outer wall was destroyed. Most of Sundabar's military leadership was wiped out when the building they were meeting in was crushed. Despite the best efforts of Aleina Brightlance of Silverymoon's Knights in Silver to organize a defense, and the valiant efforts of the Sundabar garrison, orcs streamed into the city, slaughtering the human population on the surface and driving what few defenders remained into the caverns below, and from them many fled through the Underdark. The dwarves of the undercity barricaded themselves in the Everfire caverns, and waited. When the orc warlord Hartusk left only a token garrison behind in the city to slow pursuers, the dwarves emerged from below and set about slaughtering every orc and goblin in Sundabar.",
								"Sundabar is now a dwarven city in its entirety; the human population is gone. Efforts to clear away rubble and debris from the attacks are slow, as most dwarves remain in the sheltered undercity, and those few who have duties on the surface have taken over the buildings with the least damage, scavenging stones from ruined structures to reinforce those that can be salvaged.",
								"Before the war, Sundabar's surface streets were cobbled smooth, but many of those roads have been destroyed by falling stones, torn up for ammunition or to repair walls, or simply neglected. Now, the surface city is a hollowed-out ruin. Some believe that the city above will be allowed to wither into oblivion, with the exception of the sturdy double wall that surrounds it (and which the dwarves have already repaired). The temples of human deities stand abandoned. The walls are patrolled by a few sharp-eyed sentries, whose duty is to report what they see and to turn away unwanted visitors.",
								"In the center of the upper city, the Circle still stands around the ruin of the Master's Hall, ready to receive visiting caravans, livestock, and merchants. However, few such visitors arrive, and fewer still are welcomed, as Sundabar prefers to engage in trade nowadays only with other dwarven cities through the Underdark. Were it within the Forgemaster's power, he would see to it that all commerce entering and leaving the city do so by means of underground traffic, so that most surface trade routes could be abandoned entirely.",
								"Sundarren trust of outsiders is low, and their assessment of humans lower still. During the war, of all the human cities, only Silverymoon made any attempt to aid Sundabar, and that aid was (to dwarven minds) far too little and too late. As a result, with the Silver Marches dissolving, Sundabar wasted no time withdrawing from the Lords' Alliance as well, officially severing formal ties with the human realms of the North except for those necessary for trade. Given that such trade is now a rare occurrence, most of the human realms see Sundabar as jealously guarding its wealth and cravenly hiding beneath the surface, while the rest of the region does what it can to recover from the recent conflicts. Sundabar's losses in buildings and in population have done nothing to diminish the contents of its overflowing coffers, and despite its current state, the city remains one of the wealthiest in the North, though most of that coin rarely leaves the city now.",
								"The notion of kingship has come up among the dwarves in the undercity, but the Forgemaster has rejected the idea. Let the dwarves tend to themselves, surely, but there should be no king in Sundabar. I don't know whether Flamestoker's reticence is false modesty or true wisdom, or if he is waiting for a warrior-king to claim Sundabar as part of a larger realm."

								"West of the High Road and hard to the coast near the Mere of Dead Men lies what humans refer to as Thornhold. Once the keep of a petty warlord of the Margaster family of Waterdeep, it was captured and claimed by a paladin as part of the Second Troll War. For many years the Knights of Samular, an order of Tyrran paladins founded by one Samular Caradoon, used Thornhold as its base, though the hold remained the personal property of the Margaster family.",

When the Zhentarim marched through the Underdark to claim Thornhold, they passed through the caverns of Clan Stoneshaft, which had lived below since before the time the surface city was erected by humans. Though the Zhentarim killed or enslaved many of the dwarves there, they failed to destroy the clan. The survivors soon escaped, regrouped, and retook Thornhold by force under their leader, Ebenezer Stoneshaft, with the aid of Samular's descendant, the Harper Bronywn Caradoon. After the fortress was reclaimed, in a gesture of respect and gratitude, Caradoon bequeathed its custody to Clan Stoneshaft.",
								"The dwarves of Thornhold are all of the Stoneshaft clan, and because tunnels from their home connect to the castle, they refer to the place as Stoneshaft Hold; they use \"Thornhold\" only when a non-dwarf in a conversation is confused and an explanation must be made. By habit and nature, Stoneshaft dwarves are secretive (even for dwarves), but nonetheless always eager to hear what's afoot in Waterdeep, particularly any doings involving the Margaster family, whom they see as foes who will one day attack their home to regain it or destroy it if they can't take it back.",
								"To most humans, Thornhold is merely the fortress above the surface, a castle of gray stone with a thick, curving wall and a two-towered central keep. They don't know of the caverns below that lead to the Stoneshaft clanhold. The cliff facing the sea is so sheer that no wall need be built to protect that side of the hill on which Thornhold sits. The castle is utterly without adornment or ornamentation, and only crenellations and arrow slits break the solid face of stone. Within the castle, surrounding the bailey, are small buildings of wood and plaster that hold animals and are used for smithwork, candlemaking, laundry, wood repairs (including wagons and the like), and brewing beer.",
								"Long ago, Thornhold was a profitable stopover for caravanners, adventurers, and other travelers journeying north along the High Road past or through the Mere of Dead Men. For decades, the expansion of the Mere in the calamities of the Spellplague cut off most travel along the High Road. During that time, the Stoneshafts lived in relative isolation, stockpiling their ore, refined metal, and crafts. Stoneshafts are known for the fine metal- and gemwork they craft, considered by most to be works of art worn as personal adornment.",
								"The Margasters of Waterdeep believe that they still have a right to Thornhold. The fortress sits on the reestablished High Road leading to Neverwinter, so it is no wonder that the nobles wish to profit from the fortress's location along that route. The Knights of Samular also show interest in restoring their outpost at Thornhold as a prelude to sorties into the Mere, and there is talk that these desires may lead to a curious alliance between the grasping human nobles and the high-minded paladins.",
								"Stoneshafts fear the politics of powerful Waterdeep will lead to an assault on Thornhold. They have thus been preparing for siege by gathering supplies and reinforcing Thornhold's defenses.",
								"Stoneshaft dwarves can taste the wealth, bustling energy, and constant excitement of nearby Waterdeep, and want to share in it. They don't want to be forced into isolationism, and kept away from Waterdhavian society and the riches of trade. The Stoneshafts aren't blind to House Margaster's ambitions, and they know that they must bring in profits if they hope to weather the challenges to their home. They're very careful to avoid being caught alone, fearing kidnap or torture at the hands of hired agents of the Margasters eager to learn the secrets of their defenses. For the same reason, only the Stoneshaft elders know and plan all the details of those defenses, so any single dwarf doesn't know everything and can't reveal it.",
								"Stoneshafts like and are interested in the full variety of clothing and fashions, music, jokes and current news and rumors, and household goods and tools that Waterdeep offers. They tend to favor maces and morningstars and other bludgeoning weapons, plain armor with fullface helms that conceal a wearer's identity and that have plates to protect the vital areas of a knocked-down dwarf, and spicy foods."

								"I don't know what the people of Mintarn did to attract Beshaba's ire, but they surely have her attention. For as long as I can remember, Mintarn has lived in the shadow of the dragon Hoondarrh—called the Red Rage of Mintarn since he dwells on an island close by—but for just as long, the people of Mintarn have been able to purchase the dragon's mercy. Now a series of events conspire to threaten their power to pay the dragon, as well as their other aspirations on the Sword Coast.",
								"Mintarn has long been a neutral ground for various forces—a place aloof from the conflicts between the citystates of the coast and the rivalries of the Northlander isles. Any ship—be it pirate, privateer, or merchant vessel—could dock at Mintarn and find a warm welcome. Many treaties were struck on its shores, and when peace couldn't be achieved, soldiers and ships of Mintarn hired themselves out to various power groups, with no fear of retribution on Mintarn.",
								"Not long ago, Mintarn was awash with coin. Dagult Neverember invested heavily in the island, creating a ship-building company, combat-training facilities, and even lending his coin to the yearly tribute to Hoondarrh when other means fell short. The White Sails company in which he invested grew to become Mintarn's preminent supplier of mercenary ships and soldiers.",
								"Things only improved when Waterdeep wasted its navy chasing Northlander pirates. Then Neverember, acting as Open Lord of Waterdeep, relied on his connections to Mintarn to draft a new mercenary navy for the city. What's more, Neverember took it on himself to raise Neverwinter from the ashes, hiring more mercenaries of Mintarn to serve his needs as that city's Lord Protector.",
								"With funds from two of the greatest cities of the Sword Coast filling its coffers, Mintarn knew a prosperity of which its people had never dreamed. It's true that the same tide that had coin flowing into Mintarn drew much of its young and vibrant people outward, but those they left behind were comforted by the knowledge that their family and friends didn't leave for war, but for much safer duties.",
								"The trouble started, not surprisingly, with Hoondarrh. Though Mintarn made yearly tributes to the great wyrm and was always careful to neglect not a copper, old Hoondarrh was known to sleep for decades at a time, and the folk of Mintarn took their agreement with the dragon for granted. But something awoke him early a few years ago, and it was as if the red bastard could smell the gold coming into the island. Although Mintarn had made proper tribute, Hoondarrh landed atop Castle Mintarn, toppling two of its towers with his weight, and roared a demand for more treasure, right then, and in future tributes.",
								"Of course, the folk of Mintarn scrambled to meet the impatient wyrm's demands. Even if they had all the soldiers shipped away to Neverwinter and Waterdeep, what could they hope to do to mighty Hoondarrh?",
								"Things got worse recently when Neverember was deposed as Open Lord of Waterdeep. The Lords of Waterdeep have decided to reestablish their own navy, and they've told the soldiers of Mintarn to leave the city or take a commission among the navy or the city's other armed forces. Now in Neverwinter, Lord Neverember has decided to do away with a mercenary force as well. He says he wants to instill a sense of civic pride among the folk of Neverwitner, but many in Mintarn see it as a betrayal. Neverember is a cunning man. I think with Hoondarrh active, the Lord Protector is simply cutting his losses. He didn't get the nickname Dagger just because his first name is Dagult.",
								"Mintarn had been playing the game well, but now it finds itself backed into a corner with few moves left to make. The coin is no longer flowing into its harbors, and many of its best and brightest have decided not to return. There's talk of hiring adventurers to slay Hoondarrh, but Hoondarrh's hoard must be massive. If that's not enough of a draw to dragon slayers, then there's no amount of money Mintarn could offer that would sweeten the deal.",
								"I like Mintarn. It has cozy inns, and they make a brilliant green wine unique to their island. But, there are safer harbors during the current storm. Maybe in another decade or two I'll try Mintarn again. In the case that you visit, here are a few other things you should know of Mintarn.",
								"Every five or six years, a new tyrant—yes, that's what they call themselves—emerges on Mintarn, ruling the island kingdom in the name of preserving its status as a neutral ground and a free port. A few years ago, Her Tyrancy was Bloeth Embuirhan, the supposed great-granddaughter of a tyrant from a century ago. She ruled the island through its most prosperous days, but odds are that the folk of Mintarn (and maybe herself as well, if she has her wits bout her) wants someone else on the throne now.",
								"Despite its open harbors and many fine establishments, Mintarn remains a loosely settled island. There are farms and homesteads, to be sure, but also wide, open spaces between them, and enough land that anyone could make a small living if so inclined."

More caves are said to lead out from that bay, one even going straight up into the ceiling. Sometimes the tribute carriers can hear Hoondarrh's breathing from one of the caves: great inhalations, exhalations, and deep rumbles of slumber. When they can't hear such noises, you might think folk of Mintarn would be inclined to explore Skadaurak, but as it was explained to me, the lack of the dragon snoring might mean he is away hunting somewhere, but it could just as easily mean he is present, watching, and holding his breath."

Where some pirates hold to their own code of conduct, the folk of Nelanther care nothing for rules, honor, or even good, neighborly sense: they attack each another as often and as viciously as they do any passing ship or convoy. Simply put, the Nelanther Isles are a chain of reavers and raiders, who eke out a living fighting whomever they can find.",

For one thing, it's a fool's errand: tribes split up or are destroyed at such a rapid pace that by the time you finished counting, you'd have to start over anyway. For another, it's dirty, dangerous work, and dealing with pirates is a task best left to swift ships, well-armed navies, and the kinds of fools that would want to count them in the first place.",
										"If you do find out the name of a tribe in the Nelanther, be careful about mentioning it to another Nelanther ship unless you can confirm that the ship belongs to a friendly tribe. Even so, be advised that alliances are short as summer storms in these isles, and it's not likely you'll be around long enough to witness a new one being forged. Proclaiming your allegiance to a certain tribe might anger the one you're talking to.",
										"Still, if you're looking for cheap, strong hands, Nelanther may be the place for you, but don't expect much in the way of loyalty or cleverness out of them. Hiring too many Nelanther sailors on a ship is just asking for your ship to be taken from you, sailed back to the islands, and given new life as a pirate vessel."

Four ship captains of my acquaintance claim to have seen it one moment, and then not seen it the next, and sailed straight through its former location as though it was never there.",

If any isle were to vanish into thin air, it would be theirs. Likewise, Nimbral's return is certainly within their capabilities, and perhaps this event is the climax of a trick so long and complex that even a gnome can envy its scope.",

They in turn appoint the heralds, who proclaim the laws, and the Knights of Nimbral, fabled hippogriff riders clad in armor clear as glass but strong as steel. Don't let the fact that they are called knights fool you. The Knights of Nimbral have always acted as pirates when out on patrol over the seas, preying on ships that strayed close to their island.",

Alas, in the time since we last spoke, all those captains have died, and I can't question them further about what they know of the place.",

In ancient days, so long ago that even elves think of it as their mythic past, the elves of many nations sought a perfect homeland for their people. (That was the problem there, of course. You'll miss out on a wealth of beauty it you're always looking for the perfect gem.) Not finding it in the world, some elves (sun elves, I'd wager) looked beyond the world to create one. These High Mages gathered together to perform a mighty work of magic that would bring Toril into contact with Arvandor—that's right, the mad fools actually wanted to bring into our world some of the lands in which their gods dwelt!",

How would you know, right? Well if you're ever honored to meet an elderly elf at such a time, you'll see a similar arc in each of the elf's eyes above the pupil. This is Sehanine Moonbow's way of guiding the elf to the afterlife. The arcs can blind the elf to this world, but they vanish when the elf enters the next, allowing sight of the elven heaven. Well that's exactly what happens in Evermeet, and the elf need not be dead to achieve it. Don't believe me? Well, I saw what I saw.",

This alone makes it remarkable, but there, in the midst of a wilderness with nothing to set it apart for greatness, a mortal man murdered Bhaal, the god of murder. This is no tall tale. Even a century after Bhaal's blood was shed there, the river's waters run black and foul for miles west of the bridge.",
								"Adding to the location's sacred nature, Cyric, the man who killed Bhaal, was himself elevated to godhood. Although he proved to be a malign power, statues of both Cyric and Bhaal were erected on the ends of the bridge, the two gods facing each other (though it is said Cyric stabbed Bhaal in the back). About a century ago, fanatics of Mystra tore down the statues and flung their stones in the river, but fearing retribution for such sacrilege, the merchants who use the bridge pooled funds to have them rebuilt in grander style than before. Now each god stands atop his own decorated archway that serves as entrance to the bridge.",

The bridge serves as a connection between the lands of the North and the Western Heartlands.",

Although an investigation was undertaken, no sign of Tamal or any of the others was discovered. Thavus Kreeg, Tamal's rival for the post, was elevated to the post of High Observer soon after, and one of his first declarations was that Bridgefort be rebuilt and given a new name in honor of lost Tamal.",
										"A flurry of activity occurred around Boareskyr Bridge at that time, with the soldiers of Elturgard making frequent patrols of the road and surrounding lands while Fort Tamal was being constructed. Today things are fairly quiet at the bridge. The tradition of caravans camping at the bridge and pilgrims visiting it continues, but now people stay in a caravan ground around a small village that has grown up outside the fort.",
										"Activity around the area is overseen by a curious mix of Companions of Elturgard. The Companions—all paladins of gods such as Tyr, Torm, Helm, and Amaunator—tend to be either young firebrands or grizzled veterans content to sit by a fire. Many of the veterans have been stationed at Fort Tamal since it was constructed, and they have families that live in the village outside its walls. Their more youthful counterparts come from all over Elturgard, but all seem to have been assigned to Fort Tamal after some act of insubordination. Perhaps it is hoped that time out on the frontier with their more experienced counterparts will cool some of the young Companions' zeal.",
										"Certainly some of the young Companions I've spoken with see their post as a punishment. Boareskyr Bridge is far from the rest of Elturgard, and the caravans that camp at Fort Tamal never seemed to need such a robust guard before. Even the relative nearness of Najara seems to provide little reason for so many of Elturgard's mightiest defenders to be squandered on such a trivial task. For their part, the elder Companions talk of fulfilling duties and following orders, but to me they seemed too content.",
										"A paladin should have drive. They have been granted the power of the gods for a reason, and surely that reason can't be to stand guard while merchants sleep. Then again, the High Observer is, by all reports, a wise and effective ruler. Perhaps he perceives threats at Boareskyr Bridge that I can't. Najara has been more active of late, despite its quiet exterior, I assure you. Dragonspear Castle to the north was once again the source of an infernal incursion. And maybe there is something sinister about this place where a god of murder died and a god of lies is honored.",
										"For my part, I sympathize with the young firebrands, and I counseled those to whom I spoke to look to the skies. In the time of Cyric's legendary battle with Bhaal, pegasi dwelt nearby. The magical creatures are said to favor those of pure heart and even allow themselves to be ridden by such folk when the cause is just. That favor might never be bestowed on the young paladins, but I'm sure the thought will provide them with some pleasant daydreams."

This wall is interrupted by several towers all the way around, and it encloses a large space from which even more of these same towers rise. Those who have seen this vista from above have said that it looks like nothing so much as a cake decorated with too many candles.

The Waterdhavian sage Waldrop tells me that the recipient of this spell is an Avowed in a room nearby with a massive tome that notes the books in Candlekeep's vaults.

The monks' first priority is the defense of the library's knowledge against those who would steal or destroy it, but also against natural effects that might do likewise, such as mold, wet, and decay. Many of the monks wield various kinds of magic items to aid in these endeavors, and Candlekeep's facilities include more than a few scriptoria to facilitate the copying of books becoming worn, binderies to repair the same, and even magical storage that preserve rare books from any further decay or damage.",

As it does so, everything else falls silent around you. In short order, a procession of Avowed arrive on the scene, and the only sound anyone can perceive is their echoing, sonorous chant. The Chanter or one of his subordinates (called \"voices\") leads this procession, and each of the Avowed is expected to lend his voice to the procession occasionally.",

She was tall, and I remember thinking that she was one of the most erudite folk I'd ever spoken with. Each of the Great Readers is given an arena of responsibility within the Avowed, usually a topic of scholarly importance, and acknowledged and treated as the foremost expert in that field.",
										"Finally, above them all are two others: the Keeper of Tomes and the First Reader. Where the First Reader's focus is maintaining the integrity of Candlekeep's scholarship, and ever expanding its literary resources and base of knowledge, the Keeper governs the great library. The Keeper's word is law, quite literally—each Keeper's edicts are recorded for the edification of future Keepers, and all are maintained as ongoing traditions until changed by the word of a future Keeper. Waldrop tells me that traditionally the Keeper and the First Reader are supposed to have an antagonistic relationship, one focused on the cloistered monks and the enlightened goals of the library and the other on the mundane aspects of scholarship and Candlekeep's interactions with the outside world.",

While these scholars rarely have much coin to pay for the services of a company of venturers, they do possess the precious currency of Candlekeep: knowledge. I know of many companies who have been shown lore concerning lost ruins, then asked to brave some dangerous place and return with prizes that can be found only in that location. If the treasure that might be found in such places isn't enough of a reward, some Avowed are empowered to offer inducements such as procedures for creating magic items and written copies of rare spells to sweeten the deal."

The vaunted Black Network was shredded. Cells of Zhentarim agents were cut loose, and without connections or direction, they dissolved or were crushed by rivals. The Zhentarim was no more.",
								"Or so it seemed. There was one stronghold of the Zhents that had not fallen and whose leader never wavered in his dedication to the organization. Darkhold stands deep in the mountains of the Western Heartlands, and there the remnants of the Zhentarim quietly gathered. There they swore allegiance anew to the leader who promised to reforge the organization into something stronger than before.",
								"The man to whom this new Zhentarim owed fealty was a dark knight known only as the Pereghost. The Pereghost had long led the armed forces of the Zhentarim at Darkhold, and his vision for the revival of the organization was along military lines. After a time of recruitment and training, the Zhentarim emerged from Darkhold not as conquerers or as bullying capitalists but as mercenaries willing to serve others instead of forcing them to serve.",
								"In the years that followed, the transformation served the Zhentarim well. They earned a reputation for sterling service, and their ranks swelled. Those who knew of Darkhold thought of it as the headquarters of this new version of the Zhentarim.",
								"Membership in the Zhentarim is difficult to assess, but my source told me they might have greater numbers now than before their organization's fall. New leadership for this larger group has led to a shift in focus. While still a source of capable mercenaries, the Zhentarim have diversified into mercantile pursuits. Zhent guards now ride alongside caravans of their own. And whereas a military organization served it well in the chaotic period after its fall, my source frequently described the Zhentarim as a \"family\" and leaders as \"my good friend.\"",

An enormous mountain peak called the Gray Watcher of the Morning looms behind Darkhold to the east, casting a great shadow over the keep from sunrise until nearly midday. Darkhold sits in a cleft in the side of the Gray Watcher, the highest point of permanent occupation in a relatively flat and defensible valley called Darkhold Vale.",
										"Darkhold Vale contains a small settlement of the same name, consisting mostly of shepherds who tend their flocks in the high meadows of the Sunset Mountains, and a few farmers who coax fine crops from the soils that cling to the vale's fields. The settlement's main source of prosperity is the black stone quarry at the southeastern edge of the vale; the heavy carts groaning with slabs of stone for sale and the large, muscled workhorses that pull them are common sights here. The common folk of Darkhold Vale tend to be surly and suspicious of outsiders, though they are careful to avoid offense.",
										"This settlement of about a hundred or so is utterly under the dominion of Darkhold and has seen some benefit from the situation: the vale folk see a great deal more traffic and trade than the little hamlet would ever expect otherwise. Until recently, all the caravans bound for Darkhold could seek sanctuary only in the shadow of the keep itself. Now the people of the vale have recently built both an inn, called the Wyvern's Rest, and a separate tavern, called the Rookery.",
										"Some of the locals send to market bales of the thick, rich wool they shear from their sheep. Others make a living hawking the dandelion wine that Darkhold Vale has always produced, but only recently begun to sell abroad. The vale has a small militia, technically under the command of the Pereghost, but which answers to a local captain named Sulvarn.",
										"To those who've come into conflict with the Zhentarim, living in a place so firmly in their power seems unthinkable, but the reality is that life is sedate here. Certainly, the soldiers in the castle aren't to be trifled with, but they hardly ever engage in the acts of petty cruelty that one expects from warriors serving a local lord. Those who misunderstand the Zhentarim often do so because they imagine them to be cackling villains in the vein of the Zhents of yore. In reality, they are pragmatic, willing to do whatever necessary to achieve their ends. But they have no need to terrorize the folk of Darkhold Vale, for one simple reason: they already control them.",
										"In years past, these folk lived in fear and suspicion, with a hearty helping of racial prejudice; my first visit to Darkhold nearly a century ago was occasion for me to hear some of the vilest epithets attached to my kind that I've ever heard—even worse than those that fall from the foul lips of orc raiders in the North. The attitudes of the vale folk have changed over the years, however, no doubt due in part to the orders of the Pereghost when he reengaged the Zhentarim with the wider world."

It was built as a summer capitol for the so-called \"giant empires.\" Situated in the Far Hills, the castle was in a position to dominate trade routes north out of the Iriaebor Valley. It could also dominate river trade down the Yellow Snake Gorge.",
										"The role of the so-called Giant Emperors is still a matter of conjecture and discussion today. However, there are some, scattered among the giant tribes of the North, who claim to be heirs to the ancient thrones. Whatever the truth of the empires might be, the castle itself was definitely built for giants. Its size and construction support no other explanation.",
										"Legend has it that Darkhold was lost to the giants due to internal strife—a pair of brothers quarreling over their inheritance. Through poison, magic, and mercenaries, the brothers thinned the castle's population until only the brothers themselves were left. The two fought and mortally wounded each other, and each dragged himself off to die alone. The brothers' spirits are still said to stalk the castle, each still seeking his brother's destruction.",
										"The keep was then occupied by a succession of owners, including a dragon of some repute, but it was not until a lich claimed it that the castle came to be known as Darkhold. The lich was called Varalla, and supposedly she conjured all manner of evil creatures to serve her, sending them out to dominate the lands beyond and establish an empire of evil. Varalla ruled Darkhold until the infamous leaders of the old Zhentarim—Manshoon and Fzoul—heard tales of her wealth in magic and gold. Lured by the promise of such rich rewards, the pair defeated her and claimed the castle for themselves.",
										"Upon my arrival at the great gates to the fortress, I found that I was expected, as I must have been watched since entering Darkhold Vale—perhaps even before then. After a short wait, I was met by a seneschal, a forthright woman with a strong handshake, who warmly referred to the person who secretly supplied me with the history of the Zhentarim. I found myself taken aback by this because I had thought my source and I had spoken in confidence. As you no doubt have noticed, I've avoided mentioning the name, gender, or physical description of my source, for I swore an oath of secrecy. Besides my initial shock, my exchange with the seneschal was pleasant, and I was given a tour of some of the mighty castle.",

When asked about castle hauntings, the seneschal only smiled in reply. Although it seemed a genuine smile, I could wring no truth from it.",
										"Of the castle's defenses, I can say little. My tour was limited. But I did note that, while some things on the giants' scale have been modified to suit humans (such as stairs and most doors), other things remain titanic. For instance, I have no idea how they managed to open the gates for my entrance without the use of magic."

While at Darkhold, I heard the name of another leader of some importance, Manxam, but my queries about this figure were redirected to other topics, and I didn't feel comfortable pressing the seneschal on the matter.",
										"Of the rest of Darkhold I can relate only a little more. The Zhentarim maintain two war units within Darkhold: the Storm Watch, a cadre of veteran Zhentarim soldiers who act as heavy infantry, and the Gray Feathers, archers primarily responsible for the defense of the fortress.",
										"These aren't the only forces Darkhold can bring to bear, however. The years when a contingent of giants lived in Darkhold are long gone, but in their place is an aerie of wyverns, bred and trained to defend Darkhold and to obey the Pereghost. Their trainer is a ranger named Grigarr, whose body is pocked with myriad scars from wyvern stings. The man is a greedy wretch who claims he is now immune to the wyverns' venom, after having been stung so many times. He loves telling stories in the Rookery about how he got his many stings, and thinks himself an entertaining storyteller because people listen and applaud. The truth is that the locals are terrified of him, so they humor him while he is in his cups."

								"Ah Elturgard! If any place in the world exemplifies humanity's potential for greatness, it is this nascent nation. Who could forget the shining sight of a host of its Companions, paladins all, riding out on the field, banners taught and snapping, breastplates and shields agleam with the symbol of Elturgard, and each bearing a holy symbol of his or her god—armor for the soul. We have no shortage of the good and the just among my people, but the sheer zeal and genuine bravado the Companions have in pursuit of righteousness seems to me something uniquely human. And it's not just those few touched by the gods who seek these high ideals; Elturgard's armed forces swell with men and women who aspire to join the Companions. They are the Hellriders, so named because long ago warriors of Elturel literally rode through a gate into the Nine Hells to pursue and destroy devils that had been plaguing their people. With these bright examples to look up to, is it any wonder that the common people of Elturgard also tend to be devout in their pursuit of justice and worship of the gods?",
								"Oh how bright Elturgard's light burns! If only it could last. Humans are, after all, short-lived creatures, and fickle in their faith and attentions. Elturgard is the product of just a generation or two of humans, and it seems implausible that it will last many more. Sadly, I think I shall witness Elturgard diminish. But it was a miracle that brought about the nation of Elturgard, and perhaps that divine provenance will preserve it.",
								"It began, as all the great stories do, in darkness. Half a century ago, the city of Elturel was a petty power. It had claimed its neighbors' territory under various excuses, putting them under \"Elturel's Guard.\" Then, the city's leader, its High Rider, was revealed to be a vampire. The extent of the vampire's network of charmed servants, undead allies, and willing sycophants took the Hellriders by surprise. An undead plague swamped Elturel, and although its Hellriders made some gains by day, in darkness the vampire and its minions inflicted cruel losses. Each night the good people of Elturel prayed to the gods that dawn might come more swiftly.",
								"Then, on a particularly disastrous night when all seemed lost, dawn did come. A warm golden light suffused the city and surrounding lands, cast down from a golden orb that hung unwavering in the sky, so bright that it seemed a new day had dawned. Caught outside when this miracle appeared, the High Rider and his {@creature vampire spawn} burned away to dust, and the other undead quailed in its illumination. In short order, Elturel was free.",
								"When the true dawn came, the new sun remained. And it stayed in the sky through the next night, and the night after, and each night from then until now. While some called it Amaunator's Gift, none could say what god granted them this boon. Most saw it as a companion to the sun and to themselves, and so it is known as the Companion. This holy wonder brought pilgrims of all kinds to Elturel. The devout, the curious, the afflicted—all came to bathe in its warmth and see its blessed light by night. Paladins had always been small in number among the Hellriders, but the Companion drew many to Elturgard, and the best among them was named High Observer to rule in the High Rider's place.",
								"To maintain order among the many faiths of the paladins, a special knighthood was created, named after the Companion sun. These paladins swore to uphold the Creed Resolute, an oath of service to Elturgard and all good people. And thus Elturgard now has both the Companions and the Hellriders.",
								"The post of High Observer is no longer occupied by a paladin, but by a priest of Torm named Thavus Kreeg, and this to me seems fitting. Paladins should be out in the world, using their divine gifts for the good of all, not signing documents behind some desk or dithering with dignitaries. High Observer Kreeg has ruled wisely and well these past forty years or so, but as a shortlived human, he is nearing the end of his years. When he passes or can no longer cope with the demands of his office, I hope that Elturgard can make a smooth transition to equally strong leadership. It is during such change and the struggles for power that result that humans often stray from the righteous path. Perhaps the light of the Companion will show them the way.",

The wilderness to the south is home to ravenous monsters, and the serpent kingdom of Najara to the north routinely sends agents—both raiders and spies—to test the strength of Elturgard. The knights can't afford to be anything but vigilant, and fortunately for the folk of Elturgard, they are just that.",

The fort remains sealed today, and guards occupy a fortified encampment nearby. The camp serves as a base from which the paladins of Elturgard can patrol this area of the nation, and also as a deterrent to adventurers and other ne'er-dowells who might otherwise try to find whatever is trapped in the fort's depths."

Beyond that, the orb is visible as a bright beacon in the sky. It can be seen clearly at night from as far away as Boareskyr Bridge and Berdusk, looking like an unmoving star low on the horizon.

Those who swear the Creed Resolute also promise to serve the High Observer and uphold the laws of Elturgard, and always be in service to the greater good. While originally the Creed Resolute was intended to forge the fractious paladins of Elturgard into the Companions, the oath has since been taken by all among the Hellriders as well.

This castle, whose walls surround the summit of the mount, is home to the High Observer, and to a great deal of the bureaucracy of Elturgard. A stream runs out of the center of the castle, spawned by the powerful springs in its cellars. It flows north across the tor's top and then down one of its cliffs in a series of waterfalls called the Maidens' Leap. By canal it forms a moat for the eastern Dock District, before it joins the Chionthar. Along the stream across the tor lies the long, narrow garden, an open place of flowers, wooded paths, and arched bridges. The garden is a favorite meeting place for citizens of Elturel and retains a wild beauty in winter. The rich folk of the city dwell nearest the garden atop the tor, while folk in the town below live mostly in tall, narrow homes that are rich in balconies and windows.",

Inns and boarding halls usually swathe the windows of their guest rooms in thick cloth to block out the light so that visitors can get some sleep. Without the onset of dawn or dusk to frame the day's labors, citizens rely on the tolling of the bells from the High Hall to denote the start and end of the workday. The lack of natural darkness means the city sees less of the sorts of activities that city folk in other places often undertake at night. Elturel has a low incidence of brawling and ambushes in the alleys around its inns and taverns, and those who would engage in thievery must be especially careful and shrewd to succeed."

These agents then travel out and sell the elven crafts to others, which has given the Halfway Inn an undeserved reputation as Evereska's trading post.",

They have been warmly welcomed into Evereska, but some of our people are concerned that so many new residents will disrupt the peace and balance we've thus far been able to maintain. At the same time, some of the newcomers have reacted unpleasantly to Evereska's reclusiveness, which they see as a form of prejudice or cowardice, and a few of their younger folk have taken it upon themselves to speak on such topics rather heatedly. I'm hopeful that the coming decades will smooth over these differences and sooth the contentions. Evereska is a beautiful place, and I see no reason to mar that beauty with an argument among friends."

It is said that the hills that dot the countryside here all hold the dead, and there is some measure of truth to that—many of the hillocks are indeed barrows, raised to house the fallen dead of one faction or nation on either side of a war. I have seen more than one such barrow, either broken open from the outside by those seeking lost treasures, or somehow broken from within.",
								"The Fields of the Dead is a vast, rolling plain of windswept grasses that seems to go on to the horizon in every direction.

The wind almost always blows here, and it isn't uncommon to smell salt in the air even dozens of leagues inland.",

Even if many monsters hide in the tall grass or build burrows in the sides of the hills, the fields represent an opportunity for shepherds and free folk to claim a plot that no one else has yet occupied. Small, stout farmhouses and even a few walled enclosures that contain several such dwellings can occasionally be found a short distance away from the roads and rivers that run through or near the Fields.",
								"The folk of this land are kind but wary, usually willing to share their wells or cisterns, and part with the goods they store away in return for goods in trade. I have met a few who show greater hospitality, letting strangers make camp within the shelter of the low stone walls that surround their steadings. They are a good and honest people, by and large.",

Small bands of nomadic humanoids traverse these grasslands, as do monsters from out of the Wood of Sharp Teeth to the south, the Trollclaws to the north, or the serpent kingdom of Najara to the east.

								"Built by an adventurer named Daeros after he found a wealth of gems in a sunken dwarven settlement, Dragonspear Castle was erected above the very caverns where that settlement—fallen Kanaglym—was interred. Two hundred years ago, sorcerous machinations brought about the fall of Daeros and the opening of an infernal portal in the depths of the castle.",

Discovering that the portal yet existed, but unable to destroy it, they established the Hold of Battle Lions, a fortified temple of Tempus, in an attempt to prevent anything from coming through. In time, though, devils broke through new portals inside the castle's walls and overran the defenders.",
								"Then came the Second Dragonspear War, more than a century ago, during which a strange cloak of mist settled over the castle, and the forces of Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate once more attacked. This time, they defeated the devils, leaving the castle ruined and still cloaked in mists. At least one other time since then, the devils have punched back through, amassing other fell creatures to attack the nearby settlements (notably Daggerford), but they have been fought off by adventurers each time. The most recent stories tell of heroes confronting Red Wizards of Thay and other devilry. I pray that this will be the last time such efforts are necessary, but somehow, I think not.",

Rumors say that the castle—seemingly quiescent—has become home to undead horrors of some sort, but no one seems terribly inclined to investigate such claims, so long as they don't threaten the folk who live nearby. Some interested parties out of Baldur's Gate offered me more than a fair amount of coin to investigate the truth of these rumors, though I demurred.

The river splits as it runs through the hilly lands, eventually draining into a series of lakes along the southern edge of the vale. Two small woods also grow in the vale, one along its northern edge, between the vale proper and the northern Ice Spires, and another fed by the lakes on its southern edge.",

So far as I know, they live peaceably distant from the human lands, and taboos exist among both humans and giants that keep them separate. In my time in Hartsvale, I saw no giants, but surely I saw their works. At the boundaries of lands where humans (and other folk smaller than giants) may not go stand titanic menhirs, likely erected by stone giants.",

He came back with a wife, the sorceress Ylienna of Silverymoon, and has begun to take on more of his father's onerous responsibilities. There is some strife in the court, however, for the earls don't seem to trust his \"out-vale witch-bride\" (a phrase that infuriates Taumarik, but seems to gently amuse Ylienna). For myself, I found the lady Ylienna a delight on the one occasion when I was in her company.",

Nonetheless, a certain strong breed of merchant travels the narrow mountain passes leading into Hartsvale. The dwarves of Citadel Adbar jestingly refer to these people as \"goats of coin,\" for they will cling like such animals to the most precarious of mountain ridges while seeking the opportunities that wait beyond. My own journeys with the goats of coin have impressed upon me the skill of these folk, who brave crumbling paths, avalanche-ridden passes, terrible howling blizzards, and monsters of all sorts to reach Hartsvale and get safely out of the vale again.",

In my time traveling these lands (with one of the few goats of coin that refused to be daunted by the fens around Castle Hartwick), I've found these lands to be still frontier-like, similar to some of the wilder portions of the North, particularly in the days before the founding of Luruar and the resettlement of Mithral Hall.

Thankfully the brutes are still too stupid for such complex tasks as working metal, but from what I heard in my time in the vale their culture is surprisingly sophisticated. Different tribes worship different gods, Vaprak being the one I heard most about, and these differences in religion apparently set the tribes against each other. From what I heard, both the giants and the people of Hartsvale hate the ogres, a fact for which I'm sure many are grateful.

Even during the dark times when Helm ceased showing signs to his faithful, the priests and people at Helm's Hold kept their doors open and their eyes on the road, providing refuge to any who came in peace. This outlook was recently sorely tested, and I'm uncertain if Helm's Hold passed or failed the test.",

The kindly clergy of this temple, dubbed the Cathedral of Helm, took in those who had been touched by the plague or rendered insane by the destruction of Mystra's Weave. Sadly, as all too often occurs, corruption crept into the settlement, in the form of predatory creatures and malefactors who sought to experiment on the unfortunates in the care of the temple.",

This man was Javen Tarmikos, and seeing the horrors unleashed on the world in Helm's Hold, he found his own order at fault. The Order of the Gauntlet doesn't punish the criminal before the crime is committed. When evil arises, members of the order strike and strike hard, but they leave the orcs alone in their mountains and don't disturb dragons in their slumber. After Helm's Hold, Javen found this philosophy flawed. Evils unlooked for can breed in the shadows, growing stronger until they attack. This seemed particularly true of otherworldly threats, such as portals to fiendish realms, evil spirits that seek to possess the living, and the corrupting influences of alien planes.",
										"Javen says he was ruminating on this when he received a sign of Helm's return. In the main chapel, the faithful had erected a new symbol of Helm after the last had been desecrated. Javen says he was gazing at this symbol and meditating on his order's failure when Helm's unblinking eye wept tears of gold. Soon after, uncorrupted priests of Helm's Hold, men and women who had remained ever watchful for Helm's return, experienced their own divine signs. In response to prayers, some were even rewarded with spells. Javen took those priests and followers from the Order of the Gauntlet loyal to him and formed a new order, swearing them in under the watchful gaze of Helm's still-weeping eye.",
										"The Order of the Gilded Eye is dedicated to protecting the world and good people by rooting out hidden evils and severing connections with other planes. According to their members, it's not enough to fight threats that arise. Many lives can be saved if the signs of evil and those who dabble in darkness are actively sought out and destroyed before they open the gateways to larger threats. Since its founding, the Order of the Gilded Eye has grown in number and its capacity to deal with threats, welcoming exorcists, abjurers, and spies, as well as paladins and clerics of Helm. I've even heard that assassins bear the order's symbol—Helm's eye upon a golden gauntlet curled into a fist—and it is a claim I can't disregard. The Order of the Gilded Eye can be brutal in their pursuit of evil.",

Helm was ever a god of watchfulness and protection, but that didn't make him a just god, nor a kindly one.",

The market is so named for the shrine to Sune that once stood along its edge. That shrine has since been replaced by a recently constructed temple to Lady Firehair, called the Heartward Hall.",

As much a fortification as it is a temple, the cathedral has a small building on its grounds that serves as an orphanage, wards for caring for the sick and injured, as well as a newer addition that houses the mad and deformed who have been brought up from the catacombs.",
										"The settlement enjoys prosperity today, but such benefit was hard-won and requires vigilance to retain. Helm's Hold is vulnerable on many fronts, in large part because of its proximity to Neverwinter Wood—which, if anything, has become more dangerous in recent times. Rumors of maddened treants abound, as well as stories of Uthgardt barbarians once again raiding the trails that lead to the hold.",
										"Worse still, the Holy Watcher has seen premonitions of something unspeakable rising from the depths beneath the hold, bringing down the lowest vaults of the cathedral in its bloody ascension. As a result, the temple has dramatically increased guard patrols in the tunnels, perhaps as a prelude to hiring adventurers to explore the tunnels deep under Helm's Hold for some clue of what those visions might portend."

These beasts graze without great risk, because wolves and other predators that would thin the herds are themselves the prey of the trolls and goblinoids that otherwise rule the moor. These two-legged threats sometimes seed the High Moor with traps, but are normally occupied with fighting and killing their prey and each other. There is something of a cycle to the hunts of the High Moor: wolves are killed off by the hobgoblins one year, leading to more sheep grazing, which brings the trolls out (the local trolls enjoy mutton, it seems), which brings intrepid adventurers to deal with the growing menace, enabling just enough of the wolves to survive that they aren't wiped out completely.",

They speak a dialect of Illuskan I'd not heard before, and my first meetings with them were quite tense and filled with misapprehension. However, I came to know people from both the Girondi and Belcondi tribes, all of whom acted with bravery, honor, and good humor in my presence.

								"Gone are the days when the tales of a kingdom of serpents were rumor and hearsay, stories concocted by adventurers and travelers who strayed far off the path and somehow managed to escape. It was once easy to doubt their veracity, for what nation didn't patrol its borders or establish communication (amicable or otherwise) with other nations? The stories of naga and yuan-ti were easy enough to believe, for this area had always hosted such things. But a nation of such creatures?",
								"As we now know, the kingdom of Najara, as proclaimed by the serpents that live within, lies along the northern edge of the Trade Way, northeast of Boareskyr Bridge and southeast of the High Moor. The Winding Water flows through these lands, and its other main geographical features are the Serpent Hills, the Marsh of Chelimber, and the Forest of Wyrms.",
								"I discovered for myself the truth of Najara, the Kingdom of Serpents, when a sage in Baldur's Gate hired me to guide him, his apprentices, and a handful of adventurers to some ruins in the eastern edges of the High Moor. I will forever regret accepting that commission, for not only did half the adventurers turn out to be greedy swine intent on plundering the ruins rather than allowing the sage his study, but their idiocy awoke an ancient spirit that caused most of the group to drop off into a deathly sleep while it consumed their souls. Since I am unaffected by magics that force slumber, I escaped, along with a half-elf among the apprentices to the sage. The spirit chased us across the moors relentlessly, forcing us into the tunnels beneath the Serpent Hills, where we were taken prisoner by yuan-ti patrolling the borders of their domain. The half-elf was hauled away in slaver's chains, but for some reason I was taken to the court of Jarant, the Serpent King. A brief account of that experience follows.",
								"Ancient and evil, the spirit naga Jarant rules the kingdom by virtue of his personal power and thanks to the aid of the marlspire of najara, a thin silver crown that has protective and other magical abilities. Though he still preferred to remain utterly isolated from the outside world at the time when I met him, ten years ago the Dark Serpent began sending ambassadors to neighboring kingdoms to warn them about the consequences of interfering in Najaran matters. Though I saw the king for but a moment, Jarant's influence in his realm is undeniable, for his name is spoken reverently by all his subjects. A guard might swear \"by Jarant's crown\" to emphasize an edict, and the yuan-ti who owned the keys to my shackles referred to Najara's laws as \"Jarant's will.\"",
								"No one knows why Jarant chose the time he did to make public his kingdom's sovereignty, or what he hoped to gain by such an act. The yuan-ti ambassadors he sent forth made their king's wishes clear to the nations they visited: leave Najaran prosperity alone, and discourage intruders (such as adventuring types) from violating Najaran borders to steal the fortunes of the serpentfolk. In return, the serpents promised that any caravans and other legitimate travelers passing through Najara's dominion would be unharmed and unhindered—as long as they don't stray from the main route.",
								"Reaction among the places approached raged from one extreme to the other. Darkhold reportedly feted the ambassadors well, and the serpentfolk left with not only an agreement from the Zhentish lords, but also an offer of a possible future military alliance. Not surprisingly, Elturgard refused the edict outright—and in the process of expressing that refusal, bloodshed erupted. The paladins slew all but one of the ambassadors, and sent the survivor back to Jarant's court to communicate their answer.",
								"The other responses to the Najaran ambassadors fell somewhere in between. Acceptances and refusals to cooperate, usually polite, trickled in, but regardless of their substance, Jarant's goal had been accomplished: Najara's neighbors now saw the realm as a nation, no matter whether they viewed it as a potential ally or foe.",
								"The economy of Najara, such as it is, depends on slaves to exist. Slavery is arguably the only actual trade conducted in Najara, with the ruins of Thlohtzin in the Forest of Wyrms serving as a gathering place for those who would stoop so low as to sell slaves to the yuan-ti. Different factions among the Najarans have agents waiting near Thlohtzin, each hoping to strike a bargain with slavers before others arrive. Slaves with unusual abilities or specialized knowledge sometimes set off bidding wars among the yuan-ti. I fear that such was the fate of that apprentice who accompanied me out of the High Moor.",
								"To everyone of any influence who might read this, heed my words: do not be misled. The serpents do not intend to coexist peacefully—they merely wish to use their strange diplomacy as a cloak and a shield, to protect them against the vigilance of others until they are ready to put their plans, whatever they may be, into fruition.",

										"I was imprisoned in Ss'khanaja, a mostly subterranean city on the Winding Water, where gathers the court of King Jarant.",
										"During my time in the custody of the Najarans, I learned much about—and from—Dhosun Silverscale. A yuan-ti pureblood in Najara, Dhosun acts as a councilor to the king and often seeks to mitigate Jarant's excesses. I believe that the sending out of the ambassadors was Dhosun's idea, for while I was imprisoned, he visited me several times, asking what I knew of the arts of embassy and ambassadorship. From the talk at court, Dhosun makes no secret of his desire to help his king build a nation whose status equals or outmatches other realms across the face of Faerûn. Jarant keeps him near, it is said, because of all the king's courtiers, Dhosun is the likeliest to attempt to steal away the Marlspire. Whether or not he is capable of such an act, I found the yuan-ti naga to be honorable—it was he who secretly arranged the opportunity I needed to escape, and I know he has done likewise for others in the past. I owe him a debt I intend to repay one day.",
										"Another figure of note in the court is the cunning green dragon Emikaiwufeg, often called the Emerald Daughter. She is young for a dragon and still small enough to fit in tunnels leading down to Jarant's audience chamber. Jarant is said to appreciate the twists and turns of her wit. Some courtiers believe that she is frequently kept to hand as a foil to Dhosun, as her slickly vicious nature offsets the Dhosun's more honorable tendencies. For my part, I believe she's biding her time. A great many metallic dragons dwell in the Serpent Hills, and a clear rival for mates, wealth, and power—the green dragon known as Ralionate—lives in the nearby forest of Wyrms.",
										"A variety of advisors and hangers-on can be found within Jarant's court, which is a dangerous place. A trio of yuan-ti warlocks, who claim to have tapped into the vestiges of the ancient serpent deity once worshiped at Ss'thar'tiss'ssun, leads the yuan-ti of Najara, though at court they frequently lurk in the background, simply watching."

										"The Serpent Hills is a desolate region of red clay hills and deep, treacherous ravines, featuring stretches of rough, ridged land surrounding tall mesas. Only scrub can manage to grow here, tenaciously clinging to the dry clay. Beneath this perilous territory—filled with serpents and poisonous creatures of all manner—lie the Serpent Ways, a series of intricate, well-guarded tunnels interspersed with caverns and chambers. The passages serve as the main pathways for the folk of Najara through these lands; indeed, it was while resting within such a cavern that the half-elf apprentice and I were captured by yuan-ti. I have since learned that in general, the serpents don't care who tromps over the hills, so long as they stay out of the places under them. The Najaran capital city, Ss'khanaja, is found in the northwest of the Serpent Hills, but an even larger population of snakefolk live beneath the surface. It is common to find settlements inside the large underground chambers connected by the tunnels, excavations many centuries in age."

A vast marshland pocked with sulfurous pools that often gout their steaming contents high into the air, the marsh is inhospitable even to most serpents; the majority of the denizens in these lands are lizardfolk. Once a Netherese principality, ruled by vampires, and then a holding of the Zhentarim, the Marsh of Chelimber is solidly within the grasp of Najara today.

The forest is infested with a great many serpents of both normal and monstrous varieties.",
										"Sages who have studied the serpent-life of the forest claim that some force seems to draw ophidian creatures here and then changes them—varieties of snake that ought not be poisonous bite with envenomed fang in this forest, and most breeds of snake grow to nearly double their size here. Ralionate, an ancient green dragon apparently not aligned with the yuan-ti, makes this forest her lair. It is good terrain for her; tall redwoods and coarse pines create a dense, dark canopy.",
										"Dhosun warned me that the ruins of Ss'thar'tiss'ssun, an ancient temple-city, lie in the northern fringes of the forest. At some point in the distant past, humans built a small settlement, once called Serpent's Cowl, above these ruins, but it now stands empty, likely due to the depredations of yuan-ti. Though discernible as little more than low hills in the forest today, Dhosun told me that deep inside the ruins lies the Shrine of the Cowled Serpents, a site of pilgrimage for the serpent-folk.",

								"That, of course, is just the way its residents like it. They enjoy their solitude, which is broken only rarely. The hills of Trielta do occasionally offer up some impressive bounty, in the form of heretofore-undiscovered gold and silver. While such finds are usually small lodes that are played out almost before others become aware of them, Trielta has played host to full-on gold rushes from time to time. Someone stumbles on a particularly large vein of ore, and prospectors and fortune-seekers come pouring in by the dozens. Trieltan folk tend to see these occasional influxes of gold-hungry seekers the way other settlements look upon periodic plagues of locusts: aggravating, inevitable, and thoroughly disruptive, but also part of the natural order, and so nothing to get bothered about.",
								"Indeed, even the largest of these discoveries isn't so lucrative as to be worth the construction of the full-scale mining operations that can be found in other lands. No large nations or trading consortiums are waiting in the wings to invade and take over the mines of Trielta. They are what a dwarf acquaintance of mine once referred to as \"scratch mines\"—close-to-the-surface operations, with decent yield for a small amount of digging, but not worth the construction of \"proper\" (by which he of course meant dwarven) mines.",
								"I was in Trielta resting after my escape from Najara when just such an outbreak of \"gold on the brain\" (as the locals term it) occurred. Though most of those who come at such times are honest prospectors seeking to make their fortunes, the sudden opportunity for wealth does attract less scrupulous sorts, including all manner of thieves, swindlers, and claims-jumpers—not to mention monsters that prey on unlucky or ill-prepared miners who unknowingly invade their territory.",
								"The most intense traveling I've done through these hills was in pursuit of a band of marauding lizardfolk. The head of the kindly gnome family I was staying with was taken prisoner, along with his oldest son. I helped the local halfling sheriff and the small band of militia he put together to track the band, and to do so quickly, rescuing the captives.

										"At the southern edge of the hills lies the walled settlement of Hardbuckler. It is a town of mostly gnomes, with the occasional human, halfling, or half-elf among their number. It is one of the best-defended towns I've visited, with a several batteries of ballistae on impressive cog-run cranking mounts that allow for a nearly constant cycle of firing and reloading from any of the wall emplacements. Though the folk of Hardbuckler don't have cause to use them very often, these weapons usually discourage the bandits, raiders, and occasional orc bands that would lay claim to Hardbuckler's wealth.",
										"The town eschews the sort of street network that tends to delineate most large settlements; instead it has a single street running inside the circular town wall, and another pair of straight roads crossing the town north-to-south and east-to-west that meet in the center of town in a crossroads marketplace. Many buildings structured for larger folk line these streets, for taller folk tend to prefer the comfortable familiarity they provide, but the rest of the town is made up of a series of narrow paths between the smaller-proportioned buildings that are the homes of the city's gnomes.",
										"The first time I walked along these tight lanes, I felt as though I was only seeing a small portion of the actual settlement, and I was right. Later I discovered that beneath the slate-roofed houses, with their modest little adjoining gardens behind plank fences or fieldstone walls are the tunnels that constitute the true thoroughfares of Hardbuckler.",
										"Beneath each small dwelling is an extensive cellar, often three or more levels in depth. These spaces are where the industrious folk of Hardbuckler engage in their livelihoods. Some of the cellar spaces are shops or workspaces for artisans who sleep in the house above. Other of these croftholds rent out their extra space to travelers, setting aside a few rooms for rent, and using a single large space as an open taproom, serving the sort of fare one might find in an inn. The food in such an establishment is odd—a great deal of mushrooms, potatoes, turnips, dense lichens, and stews made of shrews and voles—but filling and tasty in its own way.",
										"The chambers in these underground inns are well heated by generous hearths, and thus provide for very comfortable accommodations. More than a few merchants arrange their travels so as to be in Hardbuckler ere winter arrives, so that they can spend the cold months beside a hearth, with a slice of fried pie in one hand, and a tankard of bitter gnomish stout in the other.",
										"Any cellar space not devoted to another purpose is used for storage rather than being left vacant. Almost every family in the town has some space that it uses for its own needs or rents out for use by others. Those who buy storage from a Hardbuckler must purchase their storage crates and other necessary goods from local artisans, who also make locks, latches, waxy sealants for waterproofing crates and boxes, and the like. The crates are all built to specific sizes, with shelving and space in the cellars measured so that each container fits snugly and exactly.",
										"Hardbuckler has a well-paid wizard who provides magical security for stored items, for those who wish it. Outlander wizards aren't permitted to lay wards or protections on goods destined for the cellars—such must be applied by Daelia Inchtarwurn, the latest wizard in a long line of folk who have worked in Hardbuckler over the generations.

										"Most of the outlying settlements in the Trielta Hills consist of a dozen or two dozen halfling or gnome families, living in homes molded gently into rolling hills. Relatively shallow valleys serve as agricultural land, while the slopes are used for growing vine crops (such as pumpkins and strawberries) or grazing small herds of the large-horned sheep many of the halfling families keep, or the ornery braid-bearded goats favored by gnome goatherds.",
										"Most of these small communities aren't exclusively populated by halflings or gnomes, since such groups seem to prosper better when members of both races are in residence. Halfling families often focus on agricultural endeavors (aside from the small fungi gardens many gnomish households maintain in their cellars), while the area's miners are almost exclusively gnomes. Both folk work as herders, with halflings favoring sheep, and gnomes goats, as well as artisans of all sorts. Each community has a sheriff who maintains peace and leads defense—a role most often fulfilled by a halfling, I've found, though gnomes will certainly rise up in defense of their homes and neighbors when called upon.",
										"Some of the rural settlements mark the former locations of mines that have been played out. It isn't uncommon for halflings to move in where a gnomish mine have been abandoned, fixing up the surface entrances into acceptable, comfortable homes, with built-in tunnels that worm through the settlement. These passages might be helpful for defense or escape, but they are most often used when it's raining out to reach a neighbor's door and borrow a cup of honey, so as not to get oneself wet or track mud everywhere.",
										"On occasion, a community that sports large dwelling-tunnels, with ample space for larger folk (or \"big'uns,\" as the local gnomes say), turns its settlement into an establishment that caters to such clientele. The inns I know of are the Merry Mine-Lass, the Pipe and Hearthstone, and the Giants' Respite, my favorite.",
										"Each of these settlements is impressively self-sustaining. When official leadership is needed, the eldest halflings and gnomes are called upon to act in that capacity, but amity is the heart of community life in these hills. It is a shameful act among the Trieltans to refuse to reach a peaceable accord with one's fellows over some dispute. The folk here enjoy their simple lives, although I've come across a half-dozen or so young adventurers who hail from here, seeking out the newness of the world as a contrast to the familiarity of their homeland.",
										"Few dangerous creatures lurk in the hills—they are so densely settled (on and beneath the surface) that there is little space for monsters to lair. Cruel or ravenous creatures do occasionally creep into Trielta, mainly from the Forest of Wyrms, but such incursions don't last long—after a few sheep (and possibly a shepherd or two) are eaten, the sheriffs waste no time in forming a posse to hunt down or chase off the predators before they can do more harm.",
										"Now, sad to say, this situation might be changing for the worse. According to recent letters I have received from friends in these hills, parties of Najaran raiders have become more common and numerous. My friends fear that the threat from the Serpent Kingdom to the north will force Trieltans to seriously consider putting up an active defense of their lands for the first time in generations."

								"When I was newly departed from my homeland and first found my way to the North, I encountered a band of Uthgardt nomads on the trail—a part of the Elk tribe, led by a warrior named Gyrt. It was a tense meeting.",
								"I think the only reason I was not killed on sight is that I was an elf traveling alone. I think they feared I was a wizard. Uthgardt hate all magic but that of their shamans and any enchanted weapons and armor they find, but a wizard willing to walk the wilds alone could be a powerful one. Traveling as we were on a grassy plain, we could see one another for some distance. Since I didn't strike them down with lightning from afar, they were willing to approach peaceably.",
								"Still, they stopped when they were within bowshot and seemed to be arguing about whether to shoot me. I waited as patiently as I could until one who seemed to be their leader addressed me in heavily accented Common. I replied a greeting in Bothii, their own ancient language, which again set the group to argument. At last, the leader dismounted and approached me, giving her name as Gyrt. Glad was I then that I took the time to learn the language from a learned friend in Evereska!",
								"In anticipation of any demand, I offered Gyrt a fine dagger from Evereska, as well as a necklace I wore. For her band I offered a bag of baubles I'd brought for such an occasion. Pleased with my gifts and assured that I was no wizard, Gyrt and I sat down to talk. I asked to share her campfire for the night, and Gyrt made space for me. That was my first meeting with Gyrt, but it wouldn't be my last, nor my last encounter with Uthgardt. I'm grateful to my friend Gyrt for teaching me so much about her people, for it has allowed me and many fellow travelers to see Uthgardt and live to tell the tale.",
								"Over the years, as I earned Gyrt's respect and she mine, we became friends, and I came to know her three sons as well. Though Gyrt died some decades ago, I still visit her children, whom I played with when they were young. They now have children of their own, and all call me auntie.",
								"During my time with Gyrt and her kin, the people of the Elk explained much to me about the workings of their tribe—their view of the world and their place in it, their traditions and the laws they live by. I came to realize, as I came across other Uthgardt tribes in my travels, that much of what is true for the Elk tribe is true for other Uthgardt. Though they comport themselves in seemingly disparate groups honoring different totems, Uthgardt have much in common. What follows is what I have learned of the people who call themselves \"children of Uthgar.\"",
								"Though the Uthgardt each belong to a given tribe, these are markers of identity, rather than coherent populations. In my experience, it is rare outside of occasional large events (such as the ascension of a new chieftain, or certain religious gatherings) for all members of a single tribe to come together in one place. Instead, the Uthgardt tend to travel in bands, groups of tribesfolk that number between a dozen and a hundred, usually twenty to fifty. These bands generally consist of several family groups, each led by a matriarch or patriarch. In many ways, these folk are similar to nomadic Tel'Quessir, in that they make their decisions by consensus among the heads of the families, and disagreements are handled efficiently: those who don't like the decision of the majority go their own way, forming a new band or joining a different one.",
								"The Uthgardt are spread across the North, rarely found farther south than the High Forest. There is no nation of Uthgardt to which they belong; instead, each tribe has a central ancestral mound, regarded as a holy site. Gyrt told me that the holy site of the Elk tribe is at a place called Flint Rock, somewhere in the Evermoors. She, understandably, never offered to take me there, and I was never foolish enough to ask.",
								"By and large, the Uthgardt are a hunting people who rely on game for much of their sustenance, favoring large herd animals such as elk, rothe, and deer. Young men and women looking to make a name for themselves sometimes build their reputations by hunting dangerous predators and great beasts: bears, great cats, large boar, and even monsters such as wyverns, owlbears, and displacer beasts.",
								"Some tribes put the prowess they demonstrate in hunting to good use in another endeavor, for which the Uthgardt are well known: raiding. As a rule, the Uthgardt engage in raiding only in remote areas—meaning that the closer a potential target is to civilization, the less likely it will be set upon. The raiders prefer to strike against wealthy merchant caravans and nobles' baggage trains, which offer the likelihood of fine foods, alcohol, and jewelry that Uthgardt wear as trophies and trade among themselves. For the most part, Uthgardt have little use for coin, so travelers hoping to buy their way out of a confrontation are advised to offer something else.",
								"Uthgardt don't see national boundaries or the bonds of civilization that tie a merchant to a farmer whose house the merchant passes on the road. To them each interaction with us—meaning we who aren't Uthgart—is different. Thus, an Uthgardt band that raids in one season might come to trade during the next. They do understand the concept of belonging to a larger group, and that those groups might be in conflict. After all, each tribe of Uthgardt has its ancestral enemies among the other Uthgardt tribes. Yet when I attempted to explain how I, and elf from Evereska, was connected to folk in Waterdeep or Silverymoon, Gyrt just laughed. She had not seen these cities, so I might as well have said I knew folk who lived on the moon. When I mentioned Yartar and Red Larch, places that I knew Gyrt's band had passed near, she laughed still harder. To her I was too great, too \"strong\" as she put it, to have any connection to places she saw as providing prey for her tribe.",
								"If a band of Uthgardt come upon your campsite, my advice is this. First, do what you can to hide all signs of magic or spellcasting. Then show them hospitality and invite them to warm themselves. If you have jewelry or a fine weapon, offer these gifts to the one who seems like the leader. Ask how their hunting goes, and give them a chance to brag. Be appreciative, but not obsequious. Tell them you have heard of the prowess of the Uthgardt people—their hunting skills and strength first and foremost—but attribute these claims to a tribe other than their own. The strongest among the band will insist on the chance to prove him- or herself better than the stories you've heard, and will want you to bear away tales of about his or her tribe instead.",
								"You or one of your companions might need to agree to a challenge of some kind, a feat of strength or a bout of fisticuffs, by which the band may measure your prowess. It doesn't greatly matter if you win or lose, though. Simply express a desire or a willingness to compete, and you will earn some measure of respect. If you win the challenge, be gracious, and express gratitude that you finally found someone of great status to test yourself against. If you lose, be self-effacing and rueful, and give the victor the best part of the meal at hand.",
								"This advice will not always work, of course. Some bands aren't so easily assuaged, particularly if they are out deliberately hunting you or folk like you. At all times, remember that these are a proud and strong people with a fierce love of life and its simple pleasures. Demonstrate an outlook complementary to theirs, and they might make of you a comrade. Show fear or contempt, and they will respond with quick violence.",

										"The Uthgardt trace their origins back to the mighty hero Uthgar, a warrior without compare. During my time with his tribe, Gyrt spoke freely of the tales of Uthgar that have been passed down among his people. The saga begins in the distant past when the humans of the North lived in fear and isolation. Great spirits roamed the forests of the North, preventing humans from banding together to rise up against them. Into this turmoil came Uthgar, who challenged each of the great spirits, one at a time, besting them and subjugating them to his rule. Each of the defeated spirits became embodied in the totem of one of the groups of humans who followed and revered Uthgar. Thus were born the tribes of the Uthgardt, each taking the name of their totem spirit.",

These holy sites are scattered through the North; in almost all cases, the exact location of one is known to few people other than members of that tribe.",

I was shackled and gagged, my wound wrapped in a bandage tight enough to stop the bleeding and numb my leg, as the gray pests laughed and spouted jokes at me, and then forced me to walk until I lost consciousness. When next I awoke, there was no longer a sky overhead."

I was set to work almost immediately at a forge, to pump bellows, heft ingots, and carry barrels of quenching oil. The place is called the City of Blades, for good reason: the fine steel of the duergar is impressive, considering the quality of the iron they were starting with. Hammering, refining, and careful polishing gave the metal the strength and sleekness necessary, and diligent sharpening added wicked edges to many of the blades I handled.",

To the north, the floor of the cavern that contains the Darklake hovers dangerously low, such that in some places it is barely ten feet above the water's surface. The whole of the great cavern glows, and the continuous flow of hot iron through the city gives the illumination a yellow cast at all times. It is frightening, if you forget where you are. More than that, it is hot.",

It broke, as I expected, but did the job well enough. The duergar didn't seem to be angry that the apprentice lay dead at my feet, but it was only a short time thereafter that I was dragged off to the market to be sold. As it happened, a human was in the city on some diplomatic mission. I caught his eye, and he purchased me."

Together we would journey to a place called Mantol-Derith, where I would serve as his bodyguard. From there we would go to the surface, and I could remain in his employ if I wished. Freedom and a job? How could I refuse?",

Its location is kept secret—I only know that it is fairly close to the Darklake. The drow sell weapons, armor, magic scrolls and potions, and fine works of art. The duergar trade mainly in fine steel, and demand high prices to do so. Deep gnomes come to market with gems, certain fungi only they are capable of growing, and salt, which much of the Underdark has little ready supply of. The surface folk bring wines, ales, and spirits, cloth, wood, paper, and a great many other goods.",

There must be no prohibition on what sorts of creatures can visit here—among other things, I saw a pair of mind flayer envoys doing business in the market. The most serious of crimes are theft, the use of magic to influence negotiations, and the counterfeiting of goods by mundane or magical means. Anyone discovered to be in violation is sentenced on the spot, wrapped in heavy chains, and carted off to be tossed to the bottom of the Darklake.",

At the same time, they are masters of punishment—it is fear of pain, not fear of death, that motivates the slaves of drow. If you're lucky, you'll only feel normal shackles and the occasional whip or light spell-blast. A bit less luck or more malice, and the serpent-headed whips of the priestesses come out.",

								"For much of history, many believed that all drow were beings of inherent and irredeemable evil. In truth, most drow do align with evil, engaging in torture, slavery, murder, and other nefarious activities in the name of their demon-goddess. Almost always, dark elves who reject the ways of their people are exiled, or executed for being rebels, heretics, and insurrectionists who have turned against drow culture and the will of Lolth. But the existence of noble and self-sacrificing drow such as Liriel Baenre and Drizzt Do'Urden suggests that the evil of the drow isn't innate and can be overcome. The actions of these few heroic drow have tempered some people's opinions toward the race, although the appearance of a dark elf on the surface remains a rare event and a cause for alarm.",
								"Many drow in Faerûn hail from Menzoberranzan, the infamous City of Spiders, or one of the other drow citystates in the Underdark, such as Jhachalkhyn or Ched Nasad. Dark elves encountered on the surface are usually found near entrances to the Underdark, because they are harmed by the light of day, which weakens them and their magic. Drow who become adventurers often do so after fleeing the oppressive, cruel theocracy of the city-states. Most of these individuals live as outcasts and wanderers, though a rare few find new homes with another race or culture.",

						"Beyond these typical elements of the halfling character, halflings can be divided into two major subraces. Many aspects of the two groups' cultures make them distinct, but even without such trappings they are distinct due to a divergence in what seems to be a primal drive: to go or to stay. Lightfoot halflings are travelers as a rule, with tongues and hearts as nimble as their feet. Whereas if strongheart halflings are on the move, it always seems driven by a desire to return to home or find and settle in a new one. As the saying goes, \"Lightfoot, light hearted. Strongheart, strong footing.\"",
						"Although there are many halfling communities, particularly in the lands in and around Luiren, halflings frequently fit themselves into dwarven, gnomish, elven, and human societies. Lightfoots breeze into communities as they travel, make friends easily, and then move on as the wind or whimsy takes them.

								"As with all stories of the ancient past, tales of the origins of the dragonborn are hazy and sometimes contradictory. Each reveals something about the dragonborn in its telling, however.",
								"One story relates that the dragonborn were shaped by the ancient dragon-god Io at the same time that Io created the dragons. In the beginning of days, Io fused brilliant astral spirits with the unchecked fury of the elements. The greater spirits became dragons—creatures so powerful, proud, and willful that they were lords of the newborn world. The lesser spirits became the dragonborn. Although smaller in stature, they were no less draconic in nature. This tale stresses the close kinship between dragons and dragonborn, while reinforcing the natural order of things—dragons rule and dragonborn serve, at least according to the dragonborn's former masters.",
								"Another legend asserts that Io created the dragons at the birth of the world, but dragonborn did not yet exist. Then, during the Dawn War, Io was killed by the primordial known as Erek-Hus, the King of Terror. With a rough-hewn axe of adamantine, the behemoth split Io from head to tail, cleaving the dragon-god into two equal halves, which rose up as new gods—Bahamut and Tiamat. Droplets of Io's blood, spattered across the world, became the first dragonborn. For some who believe it, this origin story supports the view that dragonborn are clearly inferior to the dragons that were made by Io's loving hand, while others emphasize that the dragonborn arose from Io's own blood—just as two draconic deities arose from the god's severed body. So are the dragonborn not, therefore, like the gods themselves?",
								"A third origin story posits that dragonborn were the firstborn of the world, created by Io before the existence of other humanoid races, which were pale imitations of dragonborn perfection. Io shaped the dragonborn and fired them with his breath, then spilled his own blood to give them life. The first dragonborn served Io as companions and allies, filling his astral court and singing his praises. The dragons he made only later, at the start of the Dawn War, to serve as engines of destruction. This view of dragonborn history is shared by those who believe that dragonborn are superior to other races and thus should be the masters of dragons and not the other way around.",
								"Despite their differing conclusions, a common theme binds all these legends together: the dragonborn owe their existence to Io, the great dragon-god who created all of dragonkind. The dragonborn, all legends agree, are not the creations of Bahamut or Tiamat—and so they have no predetermined side in the conflict between those gods. Every individual dragonborn, regardless of one's particular draconic ancestry, makes a personal choice in matters of ethics and morality."

The skeptics believe that no matter how their original god, Io, brought them into being, that ancient deity is either long dead or uncaring about their fate, and the dragon gods that supplanted Io seem primarily interested in amassing soldiers for their ages-old conflict.",
								"Still, some dragonborn do hear the call of the gods of Faerûn and choose to serve them, and are as loyal in this faith as they are to any other cause. Bahamut and Tiamat have dragonborn worshipers, and both Torm and Tyr appeal to the dragonborn sense of honor and order. Similarly, Tempus and the Red Knight appeal to the warrior spirit in some dragonborn, and Kelemvor speaks to some of the inevitability of death and the need to live well in one's allotted time. Religious belief is an intensely personal thing the dragonborn who espouse it, some of whom are as devoted to their faith as they are to their family and clan."

Although the Moonstars worked in concert at times with the Harpers, they also worked at cross purposes, and the Moonstars membership included many whom the Harpers considered too evil, such as a vampire. The Moonstars performed many good deeds, but their methods were often more brutal and pragmatic than the Harpers' lofty ideals allowed. When Khelben died, the Moonstars seemed to collapse, and for many years the organization was assumed defunct.

Their monasteries are full of decaying, dying, and dead animal and plant specimens, which they study with detached interest. They frequently purchase rare specimens from adventurers and merchants that they can't obtain easily themselves. But such studies are only part of the monks' daily life: They seek to understand death as it pertains especially to intelligent living beings, and to this end they eagerly welcome the diseased and the dying so that they might watch and record their deaths. If such unfortunates seek release from pain through death, the monks provide it. They view death as a gift that they bestow on those who are ready for it.

								"In the vast wilderness of the Realms one can still find connections to the Feywild. These are fey crossings, places of mysterious natural beauty in the world that have a near-perfect mirror in the Feywild. You can pass through a fey crossing by entering a clearing, passing through the surface of a pool, stepping into a circle of mushrooms, or crawling under the trunk of a tree. A few warlocks seek out such places to bargain with the Archfey of that realm for power. Noteworthy Archfey patrons include the following: {@b Titania,} the Summer Queen, is perhaps the mightiest of the archfey. With a smile, she can ripen a crop, and with a frown, summon wildfires. She rules the seelie of the Summer Court. {@b Oberon,} the Green Lord, an unrivaled hunter and woodland warrior, is Titania's lover and frequently her foe. Oberon is attuned to every bough of each tree and each branch of every stream in the forests of the Feywild. If Oberon has a weakness, it is the wild nature of his heart. His mood swings like a weather vane in a wind storm. {@b Hyrsam,} the Prince of Fools, is thought to be the first satyr. He can sing the shine off gold, and his jokes and antics can cause stones to cry with laughter. Yet Hyrsam is also the soul of savagery and the wild. Hyrsam the Fool is a prankster and prone to mischief, but when such jokes turn vicious and deadly, Hyrsam the Savage is at play. {@b The Queen of Air and Darkness} rules the unseelie of the Gloaming Court from an onyx throne that sits empty except for the hovering Night Diamond, a black gem the size of a human head that dully glimmers with captured stars. The Queen of Air and Darkness is an invisible presence around it, her voice thundering from the Night Diamond or whispering secrets directly in the ears of her courtiers, and sometimes both at once. {@b The Prince of Frost} was once known as the Sun Prince, but his heart grew cold when his betrothed betrayed him and escaped, her soul becoming one of the stars. Ever since, the wrathful prince has sought to reunite with his betrothed whenever she is reincarnated in mortal form."

Such deals need not be struck directly with the power in question, however. Often a weaker fiend serves as an intermediary, and the warlock might not know whom he or she serves. Notable fiendish patrons peculiar to the Forgotten Realms include the following: {@b Baazka} is the pit fiend behind the most recent incursion of infernal forces from Dragonspear Castle. Its plans for the Sword Coast were thwarted along with those of allied Red Wizards, but its ambitions in the region remain. {@b Belaphoss} is a demon that serves Demogorgon. It considers itself the greatest servitor of the Prince of Demons and thus a rival for Demogorgon's power. {@b Eltab} was once bound beneath the city of Eltabbar in Thay, caged even by the layout of the city's streets and canals, which formed a glyph of imprisonment. The demon is now loose in the world, seeking revenge. {@b Errtu} the balor has plagued Drizzt Do'Urden for more than a century, largely over possession of an artifact called the Crenshinibon. Having lost the last battle and been banished from the world, the balor now seeks indirect means of revenge. {@b Gargauth} is a mysterious infernal power who seeks godhood while trapped in the world within a magical shield. {@b Lorcan} is a cambion who collects warlocks like one might collect butterflies. His favorite collection, the Troil Thirteen, includes warlocks of blood descent from the thirteen who first made a pact with Asmodeus. {@b Malkizid} is a solar who fell from grace when he betrayed the Seldarine. Ever since then, Malkizid has delighted in every wrong he can do to elves, but he gains the greatest pleasure when he manipulates the elves into harming each other. {@b Wendonai} is the balor lord who first tempted the dark elves to summon demons in the ancient wars between the elf peoples. It also turned them to the worship of Lolth and continued to advise and tutor them for long after the Descent."

Her warlocks frequently dream of Dendar's hiss and the dry rasp of her scales when they first realize their potential. {@b Ghaunadaur}, That Which Lurks, Underdark god of aberrations, also known as the Elder Eye. It is worshiped (if such a word can be used) by slimes, oozes, and similar creatures. {@b Kezef} the Chaos Hound is a black, skeletal mastiff covered in swarming maggots, its blood a black acid. The gods imprisoned Kezef in an unbreakable leash forged by Gond and a glowing ward conjured by Mystra, for which the Chaos Hound bit off Tyr's hand. {@b Moander} is a dark power of corruption and decay. Those touched by its influence first receive a dream, the \"seed of Moander,\" wherein the following words are heard: \"Question not the words of Moander, lest you be stricken by the Eating From Within. Go forth and possess beings of power and influence for me. Slay, and let the rot cover all. Fear me, and obey.\" {@b Tyranthraxus}, also called the Possessing Spirit and the Flamed One, seeks to rule the world through the bodies of others. Similar to the Earthmother, it uses magical pools as windows into the world to spread its influence. {@b Zargon,} the Returner, also called the Invincible Tyrant, is said to be an undying and unkillable evil. Some stories claim Zargon was the original master of the Nine Hells. Others claim him to be a powerful Demon Prince exiled from the Abyss. Perhaps neither of these stories are true, but it can surely be said that Zargon is a power that inspires madness and terror."
