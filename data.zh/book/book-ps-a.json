						"整个位面转换的事情是因赞迪卡而起的。很难想象有哪个魔法位面比这个从头到尾都被设想为 \"冒险世界 \"的位面更适合D&D的冒险活动。从《魔法的艺术：集会-赞迪卡》过渡到《空间转移》。因此，从《魔法：集会-赞迪卡》过渡到《空间转换：赞迪卡》是非常自然的。接下来是Innistrad，这是因为Strahd的诅咒冒险在同一时间推出，这是个很好的巧合。然后是 \"空间转移\"。Kaladesh时，我又偏离了D&D的核心经验，将D&D的魔法物品改头换面成了Kaladesh的乙太动力发明，呈现出一种相当快速和松散的方式。现在我们来到了阿蒙凯特--一个受古埃及启发的沙漠平面，由一个邪恶的龙行者统治，它的特点是有一个小的安全避难所，不受亡灵侵扰。这不是一个传统的D&D背景。五神的考验为阿蒙凯特的活动提供了最明显的结构。一群来自同一作物的新成员可能会一起经历试炼，而这些试炼本身就可以构成一个短期活动的全部内容。为了充实经验，人物还可以代表神或大臣执行任务：保卫赫克马，加入神在沙漠中的狩猎探险，等等。如果增加了宰相，活动就会变得复杂起来，因为宰相通常不经历试炼（除非他们选择），或者如果任何或所有角色都成为异议者。也许对阿蒙凯特战役最好的看法是，它发生在五个审判的背景下，而不是全部关于审判。审判提供了一个结构和一种戏剧感，但是人物之间的关系--以及人物与世界其他地方的关系--才是故事展开的关键所在。你可以把你的战役设置在启动玩家角色接受其中一个试验之前的阶段，把试验作为整个故事的高潮。你可以用 \"团结的考验 \"和 \"野心的考验 \"作为活动的框架装置，来探讨集体团结与个人成就的问题。(初始角色将根据自己的条件接受知识和力量的考验）。你也可以完全不考虑试炼，而把重点放在试图破坏纳克塔蒙社会秩序的异议人物上。一如既往，《魔法：集会的艺术--阿蒙凯特》是关于这个平面的权威信息资源。有了这份文件，你就可以利用这些信息来建立一个活动，只需对第五版D&D规则进行最少的修改，你可以在这里找到这些规则。即使没有这本书，你也可以在魔法网站上找到关于阿蒙凯特的传说。祝你在试验中好运!"

					"entries": [
						"The Multiverse is a boundless expanse of worlds. These worlds, called planes, are as different from each other as one living being is from another, varying in size and shape, inhabitants and environments, and even the laws of physics and magic. The existence of magic, though, is a common factor that unites all the known planes.",
						"For most inhabitants of a given plane, that plane is the full extent of existence. Esoteric speculation might posit the existence of other worlds, but such concepts are only theoretical. Only a handful of people on any given world know the reality: that all the planes are suspended together in a void called the Aether—or, more poetically, the Blind Eternities. Only one person in a million is born with the potential to travel from one plane to another, and only a fraction of those with the potential actually manage to ignite their sparks and become Planeswalkers.",
						"Often, this happens as a result of a great crisis or trauma. A near-death experience could ignite the spark, as could a life-changing epiphany or even a revelatory trance. But once their sparks are ignited, all Planeswalkers gain the rare ability to open a pathway through the Blind Eternities and pass from one plane to another.",
						"The life of a Planeswalker is a life of choice and self-determination, unrestricted by the boundaries of world or fate. Most Planeswalkers dedicate themselves to some personal mission as they explore the secrets of the Multiverse. Often, they discover the depths of their own souls in the process.",
						"This is the fourth Plane Shift article (corresponding to the release of the fourth volume of The Art of Magic: The Gathering), which means that at this point, you could put together a four-person party of Planeswalkers and have each one of them come from a different plane.",
						"Fundamentally, no game rules are attached to being a Planeswalker. Traveling from plane to plane in this sort of campaign is a lot like overland travel in a normal campaign: it's about getting to where the adventure is. It's a story function, not a rules one. If planeswalking is part of the campaign, then everyone in the party has to be able to do it, so they can travel together. (In modern Magic, there's no way to bring another living person along with you when you planeswalk.) That means there's not really any question of game balance where planeswalking is concerned—it doesn't make one character more powerful than another, and it doesn't make characters any stronger against the enemies they're fighting. So it's something that can be added on to any other character, without changing the character's class, race, or background.",
						"How does planeswalking work? Well, despite the name of this article series, it actually doesn't bear much resemblance to the {@spell plane shift} spell. When characters planeswalk, it usually takes prolonged focus to bring two worlds together and create the bridge to cross between them. This process takes about a minute and is similar to casting a ritual, so it's not generally something that Planeswalkers can do to escape combat. It also doesn't allow for much precision. As a rule, the point on a plane where a Planeswalker arrives is up to the DM, and it's usually the same location for each visit a character makes to a plane.",
						"Occasionally in Magic fiction, characters do planeswalk in the middle of combat, usually when something dire is about to happen. (That includes the circumstances when a character's Planeswalker spark first ignites.) To model that, at the DM's discretion, a Planeswalker who is about to drop to 0 hit points can make a Charisma saving throw with a DC equal to the damage taken. On a successful save, the character instead takes no damage and planeswalks away. It's up to the DM what plane the character ends up on, because this isn't usually an intentional process.",
						"You could do a lot of adventuring on just the four planes detailed in the art books and Plane Shift articles so far. But if you want to take your Planeswalker characters to Theros, Tarkir, Ravnica, Dominaria, Mirrodin, Alara, Fiora, Lorwyn, Kamigawa, or any other plane in the Magic Multiverse, you can follow the example of what I've been doing in these articles. Reskin and tweak existing monsters, and inject a healthy dose of creativity and improvisation as you go. Some of those worlds are full of creatures that could have stepped right out of the Monster Manual, while others will present a greater challenge.",
						"The most important thing is that a campaign involving Planeswalkers requires an agreement between the players and the DM. Even more than usual, if the players decide to ignore the plot hooks set before them and go off anywhere in the Multiverse just because they can, they can make the DM's job more taxing than fun. It's one thing to have a Planeswalker pop off to Ravnica for an hour to buy a cup of coffee, but it's quite another for the players to decide that they want to take on the corruption of New Phyrexia today, instead of following clues that lead clearly to an Innistrad campaign.",
						"Speaking of New Phyrexia, a campaign with Planeswalkers is generally more fun with higher-level characters. The Planeswalkers who feature in the stories of Magic are powerful mages of various kinds, and their actions can sometimes decide the fate of whole planes. It doesn't always need to be like that, of course, but it can be hard to motivate characters with the ability to travel literally anywhere to stick around and root out a nest of giant rats.",
						"So can Planeswalker characters travel from Amonkhet to whatever plane the Forgotten Realms lies on? That's up to you. The Plane Shift series more or less assumes a certain continuity from one Multiverse to the next, even as (for example) it makes no attempt to model Magic's five colors of mana in the D&D magic system. So there's no real reason an elf from Evereska couldn't \"spark out\" and find herself on Kaladesh, as long as it works for your players and your campaign.",
