						"对我来说，这是一个相当特别的 \"位面转移 \"系列，因为我是伊克萨兰世界建设的创意负责人。也许是背叛了我在《龙与地下城》工作的14年历史，艾克萨兰是一个探索和宝藏的世界，有许多古老的遗址等待着无畏的英雄们去探索。其中一个地点，显示在艾克萨兰套装的卡片上，显然是受到D&D经典冒险的启发，塔莫阿坎的隐秘神殿。这个位面只需要龙就可以成为一个完整的D&D环境--甚至还有一个世界地图 归根结底，这意味着编写《星球转移》。伊萨兰》既充满乐趣，又相对容易。Ixalan的居民与D&D的角色有很多共同点，将他们与现有的类别和背景进行映射是一项非常简单的任务。同样地，飞机上的生物--尤其是恐龙--在游戏中已经有很多类似的东西了。尽管如此，这仍然是《飞机转移》中最长的一期！这部分是因为我有一个很好的机会，让我能够在游戏中找到类似的东西。部分原因是我可以自由地发挥创意和灵感，帮助你在这个令人兴奋的世界中扮演一个角色。你会发现这里有比以往更多的表格--用来充实你的角色的个性特征和理想的表格，用来充实你的囤积物的宝物表格，以及用来将你的队伍团结起来的灵感表格。这种东西写起来既有趣又有挑战性--实际上，这很像魔术卡上的风味文字，因为每张卡都是一个自成一体的小块，一个完整的想法在一句话里。我希望所有这些东西都能丰富你的游戏。本文件的附录是对魔法的颜色及其与D&D角色和法术的关系的延伸思考。这是在午餐时间与同时也是狂热的D&D粉丝的《魔法》创作团队成员的谈话中占主导地位的那种东西，也是我在Twitter上收到的很多问题的那种东西。就像本文件的大部分内容一样，重点在于角色扮演和角色塑造，而不是规则。但这是对这两个游戏的世界之间的关系的更全面的理解的第一次尝试。一如既往，《魔法：集会-艾克萨兰的艺术》是关于这个平面的权威信息资源。有了这份文件，你就可以利用这些信息来建立一个对第五版D&D规则进行最少改动的战役，你可以在这里找到这些规则。即使没有这本书，你也可以在魔法网站上找到关于伊萨兰的传说。那张地图上有很多开放的空间。我希望你在探索伊克萨兰世界的过程中能获得乐趣!"

A tropical land covered in lush rain forest, soaring mountains, lofty plains, and winding rivers, Ixalan is shaped like a large crescent enfolding a vast inner sea. Its history has been shaped by the interaction between the Sun Empire and the River Heralds. Both peoples lived in balance while the Sun Empire maintained its stewardship of the Immortal Sun. But that balance was upset when the emperor abused the artifact's power. Now the Sun Empire has been pushed to the coastal lands of Ixalan, while the River Heralds dominate the interior.",

Some of these remnants are no more than heaps of rubble overgrown by hardy plant life, potentially interesting for the sake of inscriptions that might remain on worn stone surfaces, but otherwise remarkable only as landmarks for those traveling through the uncharted wilderness. However, several whole cities also lie in ruins scattered throughout the jungle.",
						"Quetzatl was once the home of a self-proclaimed king who challenged the authority of the emperor. Its ruins betray the violence used to tear its buildings down stone by stone, and legend holds that spirits of the dead, including the Pretender King, still haunt those ruins.",
						"The city of Pecatli was known for its grand temple, which boasted three great spires for the three aspects of the sun. The spires have long been toppled, but the diamonds, emeralds, and rubies said to have crowned them have never been found.",
						"Techepec was a retreat for the emperor and the imperial family, a place where they could escape the trials of life at court for a time. In fact, Emperor Huatzan II used Techepec as a sort of capital-in-exile during a brief period of insurrection, when another pretender sat on the throne in Orazca.",
						"Azcanta, now called the Sunken Ruin, was a thriving population center until a prolonged conflict with the River Heralds caused it to sink into the waters of the Inner Sea. Its buildings are still largely intact far beneath the waves, and some pirates now seek the city's treasures.",
						"A few lone shrines and temples dot the jungle as well, the last remnants of cities whose wooden buildings have long since rotted away. These include Tonalixco, the temple of the eastern sun, which marked the western edge of the empire in the fortress-city of Tanaztac. Icalaquiampa, the temple of sunset, was the focus of a religious sect that tried to replace the emperor with a high priest and establish theocratic rule.",
						"Aclazotz was a temple dedicated to a bat god of the night, opposed to the Threefold Sun and the empire devoted to the sun. The temple makes an appearance in \"X Marks the Spot,\" a special D&D Ixalan adventure created for Extra Life 2017, but there's much more to this legendary site. Aclazotz was partially inspired by the classic D&D adventure The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan, which appears in updated form in Tales from the Yawning Portal. If you want to more fully explore the ruins, you might use that adventure as a starting point. Perhaps this is where Elenda, the knight who brought the rites of vampirism to the Legion of Dusk, underwent her own transformation.",
						"Of course, the grandest ruin of the ancient Sun Empire is Orazca, the glorious golden city where the Immortal Sun still lies hidden. It was the empire's capital for many centuries, and tribute from across the breadth of Ixalan was brought to adorn its palaces and temples. Gold covers nearly every building in the city, and jade inlays reflect the influence of the ancient merfolk who shared Orazca with the humans of the empire. But the world has since closed up over the golden city, hiding its secrets and its treasures from all who seek it. Three golden spires are now the only visible signs of Orazca where they rise above the forest floor."

												"Many mages, especially Planeswalkers, routinely draw on two or more colors of mana. In some worlds, color pairs or triads have such a strong identity that they are manifested in the world. The guilds of Ravnica, for example, are each aligned to a specific pair of mana colors, and each of the clans of Tarkir used three colors. And some lands produce mana of more than one color, so that a highland lake might produce both red and blue mana. Mana pairs similarly suggest certain principles, create certain magical effects, and favor certain personality traits.",
												"Based on the color wheel, it's possible to speak of two colors of mana as either \"allied\" (adjacent to each other on the wheel) or \"enemy\" (separated by another color). White's allied colors are green and blue; its enemy colors are red and black. That doesn't mean that creatures associated with allied colors are necessarily on the same side of any conflict, or that creatures associated with enemy colors are actually enemies. But if conflict does arise—for example, in a party of adventurers—it's more likely to arise between a whitealigned and a red-aligned character than between a white-aligned and a blue-aligned one. That's the natural result of the different personalities and principles associated with each color. A white character might put a lot of stress on the value of law and order, and of working together toward a common goal. A red-aligned character values freedom and individuality."

When a spellcaster draws upon or manipulates the Weave (see chapter 10 in the Player's Handbook), part of that process involves tugging on a strand that connects to a land that produces mana of the desired color. Whether consciously or unconsciously, a druid casting barkskin tugs on a strand of the Weave connected to a forest in the world, drawing out the green mana needed to cast the spell.",

If you're playing a cleric, you might find it helpful to imagine your character drawing on white mana, and you'll find that a lot of your spells could indeed be white spells in Magic. You might also find inspiration in the personality traits and ideals described in the white mana entry. But there's no rule preventing your character from using spells like divination (a blue spell), stone shape (a red spell), create undead (a black spell), or insect plague (a green spell). On the other hand, you might find that thinking about your cleric as a white-aligned caster shapes your choice of spells as well as your personality."
