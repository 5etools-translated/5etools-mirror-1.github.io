				"拉夫尼卡是一个全新的世界，供你的龙与地下城活动探索。作为一个覆盖整个已知世界的庞大城市，拉夫尼卡充满了阴谋和冒险，由统治这个城市的十个强大的行会之间的冲突所驱动。",
				"拉夫尼卡最初是作为《魔法：集结号》交易卡游戏的一个场景出现。它已经成为八个卡组的主题：2005-6年的{@i Ravnica: City of Guilds}、{@i Guildpact}和{@i Dissension}；2012-13年的{@i Return to Ravnica}、{@i Gatecrash}和{@i Dragon's Maze}；以及2018-19年的{@i Guilds of Ravnica}和{@i Ravnica Allegiance}。在魔术迷中，拉夫尼卡是最受欢迎的设定之一，部分原因是世界上的十个公会强烈支持玩家构建魔术卡组的方式。",
				"事实证明，拉夫尼卡的十个公会也为龙与地下城的活动提供了一个很好的框架。它们提供了角色原型，玩家角色可以加入的竞争性派别，以及丰富的机会来发展和推动由公会的计划和互动驱动的活动。",

				"不过，种族和阶级只是角色的骨架，第二章的目的是帮助你在这些骨架上添加肉，以便使角色成为拉夫尼卡的行会织锦中的一个组成部分。第二章详细介绍了十个公会，每个部分都包括反映角色在公会中的成员身份的背景。这一章还描述了角色通过获得声望在其公会中提升等级和地位的机会。",
				"第三章的重点是城市本身--特别是第十区，它是拉夫尼卡的中心。对该区的重要辖区和街区进行了广泛的描述，使你作为管理人有足够的余地来发展地方和NPC的具体情况。",
				"第四章是关于拉夫尼卡的冒险，在{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}的基础上扩展了数百个种子，这些种子可以在DM的想象力的沃土上成长为成熟的冒险。本章还包括一个简短的起始冒险，你可以用来启动拉夫尼卡的活动。",
				"第5章包括在拉夫尼卡战役中作为奖励使用的魔法物品和其他宝物。这些魔法物品中有许多是对特定魔法神器卡片的D&D解释--不是将其机制从一个规则系统翻译成另一个规则系统，而是从卡片的味道和能力中获得灵感的游戏元素。",
				"第6章介绍了新的怪物和NPC，再次反映了在魔法卡上看到的生物，以及每个公会的性质。本章详细介绍了每个行会的行会会长，以及各种行会成员。",

										"像往常一样，阿佐里乌斯将混乱的代理人视为他们最大的敌人。他们对格鲁尔家族进行了打击，并实施了各种创造性的法律，在尽可能多的公共场所宣布该公会为非法。阿佐里乌斯也憎恨{@creature Rakdos|GGR}的讽刺表演（部分原因是阿佐里乌斯经常被{@creature Rakdos|GGR}的表演者嘲笑），并试图用有关公共表演的新法令来遏制它们。为了应对其他行会试图绕过该系统的做法，Azorius经常制定新的法律来支持或抵制旧的法律。"

All it takes is a villain willing to upset the balance of power, and the characters' guild or their own motivations should easily bring them into conflict with the villain. A party's own guild could even provide a villain, given the amount of scheming and intrigue that exists even within the guilds. A guild official gone rogue, members of the same guild at odds with one another, or even a corrupt guildmaster can put characters in conflict with their own guild.",

Initially, their motives might not be outwardly sinister. (The Orzhov Assignments table can serve as inspiration.)

								"As lumbering giants put up makeshift stages and cackling devils ignite the footlights, the first performers begin to gather the crowds. Exuberant music with erratic rhythms draws spectators from the surrounding neighborhood, and cheers of approval greet the more accomplished performers—along with gasps and shrieks as the acts get more risky and the first blood is drawn. Acrobats cavort through the streets while sword swallowers and knife throwers flash bright steel. The crowd gets larger and wilder, the shouts and screams get louder, the fires burn brighter, and blood glistens red in the torchlight. The spectacle is gruesome but captivating; the crowd hates to watch but can't look away. Soon madness takes them, and they—devils and ogres, acrobats and spectators—are caught up in a frenzy of violence. Only when it is over does the horror of the event sink in.",
