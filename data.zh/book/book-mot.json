								"命运的概念是，每个凡人的生活轨迹都是预先确定的，由三位半神的女人--命运女神--织成的挂毯来纺出。神灵不受命运之线的约束，他们的生活和传说不断变化，无尽地不确定。就大多数凡人而言，人们认为他们自始至终沿着预定的道路艰难前行，执行指定的任务，直到完成前往冥界的旅程。",
								"这种相当暗淡的生存观被神话、传说和塞洛斯人的生活经验中所体现的英雄理想所破坏。根据定义，英雄是藐视命运的预定路线的人。他们把命运掌握在自己手中，规划自己的路线，大胆地走进未知的世界，击倒所谓不可战胜的敌人，并抵制神的意志。当他们最终完成凡人的旅程时，他们对命运的自豪感得到了回报；有价值的英雄在伊利亚度过他们的余生，伊利亚是冥界最美丽的地方，在那里他们终于从生命的挣扎中得到休息。在许多情况下，他们的作品也会继续存在，既存在于后代的故事中，也在尼克斯的星空中重复出现。",
								"命运是不同的。命运之丝是从古神克洛蒂斯的头发中纺出来的，但它们并没有描绘出一个预定的未来。命运确立了事物的秩序、存在的等级、神与凡人之间的关系、支配凡人行为的本能和冲动，以及事物存在方式的其他方面。神灵和凡人都受到命运之线的制约。凡人几乎无法改变它们，但诸神的傲慢和自以为是不止一次导致了命运之线的纠缠。Klothys神执行着命运的界限。她不仅是命运之线的编织者，也是复仇的怒火，惩罚那些纠缠它们的愚蠢的神。"

						"众神可以采取他们选择的任何形式。他们最常见的是以人形出现--这是特洛斯人最容易想象的形式，但规模巨大。他们常常似乎在天空的穹顶上行走，他们的脚就在地平线下消失。神身上任何没有被直接照亮的部分都会呈现出Nyx的星空的样子。众神有时也会以动物或魔法生物的形式出现，或者以阳光或风等非实体的形式显现出来。",
						"当身体出现在凡人世界时，神能够进行毁灭性的物理攻击。赫利奥德的长矛击中了奥兰丁的城市，使其永远沉入大海，而普尔福罗斯的锤子的错误打击则塑造了山脉。",

								"泰罗斯的万神殿经过四代的神性演变而不断扩大。一些故事将这些描述为实际的世代，暗示（例如）风暴之神凯拉诺斯是海神塔萨和锻造之神珀弗洛斯的儿子。还有人以隐喻的方式描述这几代人，认为凯拉诺斯代表了普尔福罗斯的创造能量和塔萨的深刻知识的结合，从而产生了闪电般的灵感火花（以及物理风暴的愤怒）。不过，在其所有不同的形式中，这些神话在万神殿发展的基本结构上是一致的。",
								"第一代的时间早于通常被理解为 \"神 \"的存在。在凡人梦见诸神之前，在他们甚至可以想象像诸神一样高贵的生命之前，尼克斯的可塑性梦境物质以泰坦的形式为他们的恐惧提供了形状。",
								"泰坦是完全混乱的生物，代表了凡间一切反对秩序的东西，从不被崇拜，但有时会被安抚。神话讲述了诸神如何与泰坦作战并将其囚禁，将其封在冥界下面的监狱中。现在，在凡人的想象中，泰坦巨人几乎被遗忘。最古老的故事中很少提到他们的名字和外号，暗示着孕育他们的噩梦。Kroxa，死亡饥饿的泰坦，体现了死亡的恐怖--以及它对新生物的贪得无厌的消耗。自然之怒的泰坦乌洛可能被视为凯拉诺斯和萨萨的直接前身，但它是自然灾害的化身，没有那些神的创造力和思考力。燃烧之风的泰坦Phlage是一股无孔不入的火旋风，而永恒黑暗的泰坦Skotha则是无星之夜的彻底黑暗。",
								"最古老的神灵，通常被想象成兄弟姐妹或泰坦巨人的某种分支，是克鲁普希克斯和克洛特斯。这第二代神灵的起源是神秘的。也许Klothys的出现是出于一种不可避免的感觉，一种世界正按其规律发展的观念，因此，凡人的行为没有什么区别。克鲁普希斯可能是从一种神秘感中诞生的，支持宇宙的运作对凡人的思想来说根本无法理解的观点。也有可能Kruphix和Klothys是与泰坦或其他神不同的生命，而Klothys至少已经存在了不知多少年，尽管在凡人中几乎被遗忘。",
								"一旦凡人能够想象一个超越地平线的世界和一个抛开生活磨难的命运轨迹，他们就可以提出原则、秩序和自然法的概念。从这些观念中，第三代神灵诞生了：太阳冠的赫利奥德、深居简出的塔萨、心境黯淡的埃雷伯斯、青铜色血液的珀弗洛斯和目光敏锐的奈拉。众所周知，这些神灵相互之间以 \"兄弟 \"和 \"姐妹 \"相称，尽管他们从未谈论过父母，而且几乎可以肯定的是，他们不会把克鲁普希克斯和克洛特斯想象成这个角色。",
								"其他八位神，即第四代神，代表了抽象原则在凡人生活现实中的应用。例如，赫利奥德代表着普遍的道德戒律，而埃法拉则是法律之神，是管理凡人社会的规则和结构。Nylea是野生自然、掠夺性动物和季节变化之神，同时Karametra是为人类使用而驯服的自然之神--农业和驯化，以及人类生活中涉及的自然周期之神，特别是分娩。",
								"这些神承认上一代人是他们的长辈，但只是偶尔承认他们的父母。伊洛亚斯和莫吉斯被广泛认为是兄弟，但很少有神话描述他们的父母身份，而那些描述的神话则相互矛盾--这与这些永恒的战争之神的性质相一致。"

												"诸神通常将预兆作为警告或作为他们青睐的标志。对{@spell augury}咒语的回应采取预示着成功或不幸的预兆的形式，而诸神可能以同样的方式使用预兆，即使没有被要求提供预兆。当一个神圣的冠军开始行动时，一个神可能会表示赞同或不赞同，希望鼓励或劝阻凡人。",
												"{@spell augury}咒语要求一个预兆。根据你的选择，你可以简单地提供咒语描述中提供的简短答案--好的、坏的、好的和坏的，或者什么都没有，但你也可以描述更详细的预兆。答复的形式可能会根据所使用的占卜方法而有所不同，它可以超越咒语描述中提到的镶嵌的木棒、龙骨或华丽的卡片。泰罗斯的占卜者从星星、飞行中的鸟群图案、云朵的形状、牺牲的动物器官、雷声、海浪在沙地上留下的图案，以及其他许多手段中寻找征兆。因此，如果一个神谕者站在海滩上，向塔萨祈求关于你认为是灾难性的行动方案的预言，你可以描述海浪冲刷着海滩--在神谕者的脚边盘旋，让他们完全干燥。(如果有必要，你应该说明神谕者知道答案是 \"悲哀\"。）",

Whenever Nylea drew close, the great cat vanished into the forest's shadows. Seasons passed as the god loosed arrow after arrow at the lynx, but her efforts remained fruitless. Nylea eventually abandoned the hunt, only to find the feline waiting for her at the edge of a stream the next evening. The hunt resumed, but with the same outcome. It continued like that for some time, until Nylea began to grow fond of the beast. Soon, the pair started hunting together, and the lynx, which she called Halma, became one of Nylea's confidants."

A magnificent shrine to the sun god rose within the polis, and its priests, a group known as the Triarchy, grew wealthy and powerful.",

In a panic, the Triarchy raised an enormous ball of light into the sky as a replacement sun. When the darkness cleared, Heliod saw the fake sun and grew furious. With his spear, he struck Olantin, shattering the city and casting its ruins into the depths of the sea."

Though Athreos ferries the dead across the Tartyx, he's not above accepting a one-way fare from those who still breathe. Even the other fearsome Underworld guardians that keep watch over the dead often allow the living to enter. Leaving the Underworld isn't so simple, and once beyond the Tartyx River the living find themselves in the same predicament as the dead. Within the Underworld, characters who entered bodily are still fully alive. They age, suffer damage, heal naturally, and require air, food, drink, and sleep as normal.

This might even mean pursuing the soul of a player character, particularly if they're somehow barred from being returned to life through usual magical means. In such a case, consider allowing the player to run a temporary character who assists the party in the rescue or to play their own character as a soul and let them rejoin the party to help effect their own escape.",

While many of Theros's greatest myths arise from storied terrors—like the hydra {@creature Polukranos|MOT} or the dreaded titans—the monsters in this section have a feature that sets them apart: mythic traits.",
						"Mythic traits transform battles into truly legendary confrontations, well suited to the climactic battles at the ends of adventures or whole campaigns. Mythic traits are optional; they don't need to be used during combat with these monsters. If you so choose, you may simply ignore a monster's mythic trait and mythic actions. If you wish to increase a battle's stakes, though, using a monster's mythic trait results in some mid-battle twist that changes the way the monster behaves, restores its resources, or provides it with new actions to use. As a result, the battle becomes deadlier and rages on for longer than most combat encounters. Each monster features an \"As a Mythic Encounter\" section that highlights its mythic trait, notes how using it changes the difficulty of the encounter and the rewards, and includes read-aloud text you can use mid-battle to signal a terrifying shift in the conflict.",
