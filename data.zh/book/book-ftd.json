Raulothim is therefore open to negotiating with adventurers willing to aid in that task—but only those he is sure he can trust.

As such, some Fey teach their children to call Nathair Sgiathach's name in times of trouble, on the chance that the faerie dragon might be lurking invisibly nearby, as well as to put out ceremonial offerings of the faerie dragon's favorite food: apple pie."

Many also maintain a collection of portraits they've had commissioned over centuries to chronicle the ongoing changes in the art world.
