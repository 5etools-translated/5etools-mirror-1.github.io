				"收购公司成立于华盛顿州西雅图，当时人们只用沙哑的语调谈论：2009年。它最初是以播客的形式出现的，这在当时是一种不寻常的玩龙与地下城的方式。在这十年间，Acq公司采取了许多形式--流媒体、录制内容、漫画，当然还有现场角色扮演节目。虽然这些都是现在发现和享受D&D的完全正常的方式，但在当时，并不是这样的。我们这样做只是因为这似乎是一个很酷的想法，而十年后，似乎我们是对的。今天，Acq公司的冒险仍在继续，在acq-inc.com网站上尽职地记录着。",
				"我们编写《收购公司》的目的是将黑暗的办公室喜剧带入一个充满剑、巫术、地牢和（我们敢说）龙的世界。本书是与 \"海岸奇才 \"合作编写的，为你在自己的奇幻事业中取得成功做了准备。第1章为新的特许经营成员提供了一个方向，详细介绍了如何开始一个游戏和以收购公司的方式进行游戏。{@book Chapter 2|AI|1}探讨了Acq Inc特许经营中的各种职位，介绍了对冒险企业的成功至关重要的各种角色。(1%)深入探讨了Acq Inc特许经营成员的背景，将公司的目标牢牢固定在他们的核心位置。在{@adventure Chapter 4|OoW|0}中，所有这些都汇集在一个冒险中，人物从1级到6级，建立了一个政党对他们已经开始探索和开采利润的世界的要求。",
				"在这些章节之后，{@book appendix A|AI|3}介绍了收购公司世界的中坚力量，公司的创始成员和正在进行的冒险中的人物。(%%1%)详细介绍了敌人，从可怕的深海乌鸦到臭名昭著的水桶机器人。{@book Appendices C|AI|12}、{@book D|AI|13}和{@book E|AI|14}以各种Acq公司的工具和宝物作为本指南的结尾，从{@vehicle battle balloon|AI}等交通工具到强大的{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}。",

						"由于其根植于英雄主义幻想，D&D可能会感到与现代商业交易不同步。但这个游戏和它的设定实际上是对这种套路的完美诠释。还有什么比作为巨型公司的首席执行官，利用一切资源来支配市场，更能让人联想到处于更大、更坏的计划网络中心的大坏蛋？什么是冒险党，而是一个有限责任公司，每个成员都为发展品牌和扩大权力基础贡献专门技能？",
						"同样，从龙与地下城游戏的最早版本开始，雇佣兵、跟班、学徒和其他为英雄工作的有偿劳动者就一直是龙与地下城游戏的主要内容。AD&D中的魅力除了决定你的角色可能聚集多少追随者外，几乎没有其他用处--更重要的是，在这些追随者抛弃你之前，你可以让他们经历多少痛苦和折磨。在《收购公司》的世界里，这些受雇的帮手因其对战役故事的重要性而回归到突出的位置。当然，也是为了达到喜剧效果。",
						"当角色的等级相对较低时，收购公司的游戏风格会给他们带来更多的障碍，需要克服。公司和商业生活中经常出现的怪异、无情和超现实的元素可以为最普通的冒险活动增加一定程度的危险或荒诞。随着角色等级的提高，以及他们的特许经营权获得更高的等级，他们与收购公司的联系可以帮助拨高任何冒险路径的风险。在Acq公司的活动中，每个NPC都是一个潜在的客户。每一个发现的宝藏都是对特许经营权和其未来的投资。每一个可能成为英雄的人都是竞争对手，而每一个反派都是邪恶公司的头头，都在等待着市场的波动。",
						"俗话说，金钱使世界运转。在现实生活中是如此，在幻想领域也是如此。全球性企业与政治权力结盟的深远力量不仅影响了我们自己的现实世界，而且还塑造了它。将强大的公司与贵族合作或反对贵族以获得金钱、权力和影响力的概念引入D&D，为你的活动创造的故事增加了另一层深度。",

For example, a successful philanthropic enterprise (one of the new activities in this section) could draw the attention of a noble who begins to question the reputation and honesty of the characters running the franchise. Or the party might launch a marketeering campaign (another new activity), only to discover that their branding has an accidental resemblance to the logo of an assassins' guild. Complications are an excellent way to develop rich interactions between the setting and the characters. In an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, even the smallest actions can have unexpected (and, ideally, hilarious) consequences.",
										"Rivals represent any of the factions and organizations that can come into play during an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign. Rivals don't have to be villains or mortal enemies of the characters, though. Other Acq Inc franchises all compete with the characters' franchise, seeking to expand their own reach and impress Head Office. Governments, merchants, guilds, religious institutions, and noble families can all take notice as a franchise grows in power. And outside the characters' immediate sphere of influence, factions such as Dran Enterprises and the Six work dark plots that might make the characters targets for assimilation or destruction. (The plots of the Six and the operations of Dran Enterprises both play a part in the adventure \"{@adventure The Orrery of the Wanderer|OoW|0},\" chapter 4 of this book.)",

Certain complications might be caused by rivals, as when the orc army camping in the characters' territory is revealed to have been invited there by a competing franchise. Other complications might draw a rival in, as when a greedy noble decides they want a piece of the franchise's action.",

Tales of the group's adventures are well known across the North and the Sword Coast. But less well known to many is that the \"C\" team did not come together by mere chance.",
						"{@creature Walnut Dankgrass|AI}, {@creature Rosie Beestinger|AI}, {@creature Donaar Blit'zen|AI}, and {@creature K'thriss Drow'b|AI} were all hand-selected for membership in Acquisitions Incorporated by founder {@creature Omin Dran|AI}, based on an experience he'd had as a young man. Upon entering a creature called the Wandering Crypt, Omin saw a vision of the heroes who would deliver his sister from that same creature years hence—and later created the \"C\" Team as a manifestation of his lifelong goal of seeing {@creature Auspicia Dran|AI} returned to the world.",
						"The \"C\" team is headquartered in the small town of Red Larch, residing at the Dran & Courtier inn. The fact that the proprietor of this inn is one Prophetess \"Propha\" Dran, mother of {@creature Omin Dran|AI}, is entirely coincidental but a totally excellent strategic and cost-saving move.",

								"The hulking dragonborn decisionist of the \"C\" Team, {@creature Donaar Blit'zen|AI} is an icon of brash confidence and warrior chill. He is known for his furious skill in battle, and for his propensity to fall asleep as soon as a fight is done (as well as countless other inopportune times). More immediately notable is the unique physical trait that all members of his clan bear—a stylish tail that is rare and often considered a deformity among dragonborn.",
								"As with his tail, an odd quirk of heritage makes Donaar's acid breath more of a signature vomiting, giving rise to a driving paranoia that this regurgitation might damage his teeth. As testaments to his obsession with dental hygiene, Donaar named his greatsword Toothbrush and calls his whip Floss. He carries an actual toothbrush (named Percival) and actual floss at all times.",
								"Those who know Donaar quickly come to recognize that the braggadocio that defines him involves a certain amount of artifice. When the young dragonborn left his clan and family to adventure in foreign climes, he realized that doing so provided the perfect opportunity to reinvent himself for folk who had no idea what he was once like. As such, Donaar has learned that no amount of bravado and compensation is too much—provided he leaves no openings for strangers to call him on it. By the same token, strangers quickly come to realize that reinforcing Donaar's self-congratulating sense of draconic entitlement makes it remarkably easy to win his favor.",
								"Despite his easily massaged vanity, the dragonborn sometimes shows the occasional streak of selflessness. Most notably, Donaar serves in his off-hours as part-time godfather to a young dragonborn named Chronaar, who had inadvertently imprinted on Donaar as a parental figure while he watched over her while she was in her egg.",

Because after a long adventuring career, he understands that he can't afford to make more enemies.",
								"Given his blue skin tone, rumors suggest that K'thriss is of mixed heritage, but no one knows for sure. As a young and doubting adherent of Lolth, he stumbled upon fragments of a relic known as the Black Altar, exposing him to their infinite truths and shocking the drow's hair jet-black. His matching \"beard\" is actually a slow-growing colony of inert spores that K'thriss believes makes him look distinguished.
