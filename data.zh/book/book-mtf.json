						"早在精灵存在之前，科瑞隆就在世界与世界之间、平面与平面之间跳舞了。科瑞隆是一个具有完美的可变性和无限的优雅的生命，他是一个与众不同的神--可以变成一条笑着的小溪、一阵挑逗的微风、一道白炽的光束、一团跳跃的火焰或一道噼里啪啦的闪电。科瑞隆的身体可以随心所欲地变成一群鱼，一群蜜蜂，或一群鸟。当与其他神明交往时，科雷隆经常采用他们的外表--男性、女性或其他，但也经常以玫瑰花或精致的母鹿的形式与他们为伴。",
						"无论实体采取哪种形式，科瑞隆浮夸、多情的个性都表现出来了。科瑞隆全心全意地爱，毫无保留地违背誓言，并从与多元宇宙其他神性生命的每一次相遇中获得快乐。",
						"大多数神都接受了科雷隆的易变性和热情的行为，但这些特征激怒了兽人神中最伟大的格鲁姆什。格鲁姆什的愤怒几乎得到了普遍的尊重，甚至在神圣的力量中也是如此，但科雷隆却毫不在意他。也许正是这种看似高傲的态度，使格鲁姆什能够接近并伤害科雷隆，引发了传说中的冲突，使格鲁姆什失去了一只眼睛。根据谁的说法，这场战斗是一场跨越许多星球和世界的泰坦冲突，或者对科雷隆来说只是个小麻烦。但传说中都同意，第一批精灵是从科瑞隆流下的血中出现的。",
						"这些原始精灵与科瑞隆很相似，没有那么强大，但同样多变和大胆。绚丽的精灵生物，他们在科雷隆的影子里穿梭，像精雕细琢的宝石的反光一样闪闪发光。当科雷隆注意到这些光辉的回声时，这位神在成为阿凡多王国的地方与他们一起逗留。在享受这些原始精灵的陪伴时，科雷隆开始欣赏他们的想法，这些想法既新颖又熟悉，并挑选出那些有声望的人进行特别处理。科雷隆给这些发光体的每一个人都起了一个独特的名字--艾尔德里、凯普托罗、索洛诺、纳拉利斯、埃里温、哈纳利、塔塞利斯、里利法恩、赞迪拉尔、拉贝拉斯等等，每说出一个名字，一个新的精灵神就诞生了。",
						"这些生命中的一个，虽然有幸被提升到高于其他原始精灵的地位，但并不满足于成为科瑞隆信任的下属之一。她--她这样宣布自己--看到在他们周围的多元宇宙中，其他生命在各个世界中产生了影响。这个自称为洛神的实体与其他新神交谈，并编织了一个诱人的故事，说明只要精灵们能放弃一点个人自由，他们就能获得优势。团结一致，目标一致，众神可以成为这一努力的先锋。为了实现伟大的目标而失去自由难道不值得吗？通过这个论点，洛尔思说服了原始实体采取静态的形式，大体上类似于今天的精灵的样子，从而摆脱了科瑞隆狂野的、不断变化的方式的例子。",
						"随着科瑞隆的这些原始反映改变了他们的本性并定义了他们自己，他们开始用新的眼光看待科瑞隆和洛尔思。他们现在把科瑞隆看作是他们的父亲，是他们的父亲，而洛尔思是他们的母亲，是她让他们走上命运之路。其他原始精灵中的每一个，就像孩子们会做的那样，都偏爱父母中的一方。科瑞隆对这种被认为是背叛的行为感到反感，并对洛尔思的入侵进行了抨击。一些原始精灵站出来为她辩护。他们争辩说，从科瑞隆产生的任何实体，无论多么叛逆，都不应该受到攻击。那些仍然拥护科瑞隆的人坚持认为，他们的陛下也想让精灵们变得伟大，如果所有的原始精灵都跟随科瑞隆的领导，这种伟大就能实现。",
						"原始精灵们成群结队地聚集在洛尔思和科瑞隆周围，每个实体都在为自己的案子辩护。在科里隆分心并陷入思考的时候，洛尔思悄悄地靠近他，试图给他致命一击。赞成科雷隆的精灵们帮助阻挡了攻击，但洛尔思阵营中的人仍然冷眼旁观，没有做任何事情来阻止她的攻击。",
						"这一行为使精灵们四分五裂。洛尔思和科瑞隆分道扬镳，洛尔思成为深渊中的恶魔领主，而科瑞隆则成为一个不能再被信任的万神殿的实际领袖。与科雷隆站在一起的精灵诸神成为塞尔达林，而那些与洛尔思一起逃亡的精灵诸神则成为塞尔达林的黑暗反映。除了那些被封为神的人之外，科雷隆将原始精灵从阿凡多赶了出去，并将他们托付给物质世界和多元宇宙的其他世界，如精灵世界和阴影之城的实体存在。从那时起，所有的精灵都将成为凡人，固定在他们无视科瑞隆的意志而采取的形式中。最崇敬洛尔思的精灵成为了乌鸦，而其他的精灵则分成了许多居住在地表的团体，每个团体都在各自的飞地里崇拜着部分或全部的塞尔达林人。",
						"作为这个裂缝的后果，没有一个精灵会完全回到科里隆的怀抱，在阿凡多享受永恒的生命。相反，当一个精灵的灵魂回到阿凡多时，它会被塞尔达林的其他神灵收养，并在一段时间内得到喘息的机会，在此期间，它被单独留下思考其创造者的失望。然后，灵魂从阿尔凡多出来，重生到一个漂亮的、优雅的身体里，活得非常长，这证明他们的创造者对他们的爱，在内心深处，是无限的。"

						"大多数精灵最终从精灵世界传播到了其他世界，因为流浪欲和好奇心驱使他们来到多元宇宙的远方。在那些其他世界，精灵们发展了现在与他们的民族相关的文化和社会形式。在一些地方，科瑞隆这个名字已经从精灵的记忆中消失了，但神的血液仍然在他们体内流动，即使他们对其来源一无所知。",
						"无论他们身处多元宇宙的何处，各种类型的精灵都觉得与精灵界有着特殊的联系，因为那是他们的种族在漂流后的第一个家。即使他们不能说出那个领域的名字，或者不知道如何回到那里，但当他们精神恍惚时，脑海中有时会闪现出关于那个地方的残余记忆。",

								"精灵们很少轻浮和无忧无虑的原因是源于一种与生俱来的萎靡不振或悲伤，当他们选择停止追随科瑞隆的道路时，这种悲伤就注入了原始的精灵。这些遗憾和悲伤的感觉在他们生命中的不同时期笼罩着所有的精灵，并影响着他们社会的各个方面。",
								"精灵中的祭司们通常认为，除非科瑞隆改变心意，否则断裂的联系永远无法愈合。尽管科瑞隆易变，但神一直坚持一点：只要洛神还存在，她背叛的责任就落在所有精灵身上。当原始精灵为了伟大的承诺而抛弃了无形和无常时，他们放弃了科瑞隆最珍视的本性部分--更糟糕的是，他们这样做也在某种程度上损害了科瑞隆的可变性。",
								"在科瑞隆看来，无论洛尔思是否欺骗了原始精灵，都是无关紧要的。他们选择了跟随她的脚步，这催生了科雷隆和洛尔思之间的分裂，即使他们中的许多人最终仍然忠于科雷隆。现在，世界上的精灵们必须永远生生不息，死而复生，承受他们祖先的错误判断带来的后果。在这一点上，科雷隆就像世界的根基一样僵硬和不变。而所有的精灵都为他们和他们的创造者之间不可修复的联系的记忆而悲伤。"

								"精灵的自然寿命为七个世纪或更长。毫不奇怪，这一特性影响了他们对凡人生活的各个方面的态度和看法。",
								"几个世纪前的事件，对人类来说是遥远的甚至是古老的历史，但许多仍然活着的精灵可能已经亲身经历过了。精灵对这些事件的记忆可能比经过仔细研究的历史学家的描述更准确，因为精灵可以在恍惚中一遍又一遍地重温记忆，每次都把它牢牢地记住。",
								"精灵的价值感与时间有关，是人类难以理解的。",
								"精灵很少感情用事，例如人造结构和家具，除了那些具有个人意义的物品，原因很简单，因为这些物品很可能在精灵之前就已经腐烂了。即使是精美的珠宝和钢剑也会变得黯淡无光，在它们的主人年事已高之前，就已经屈服于岁月的摧残了。",
								"矛盾的是，精灵们对短暂的东西特别感兴趣：一团蜉蝣、水中的气泡、幻觉、日蚀、彩虹、艺术表演等等。他们对任何美丽的事物--物体、生物、场景或事件--都很着迷，这些事物可能只经历一次，但却能在精灵的记忆中捕捉到，并在余生的恍惚中重温。",
								"与其他种族的人形成牢固关系的精灵很罕见，尤其是那些寿命更短的人。人类喜欢相信精灵不会与他们形成密切的联系，因为每当他们失去一个人类朋友时，精灵都会感到悲伤，但这只是事实的一部分。在精灵看来，人类的生命结束得太快了，精灵们无法建立起他们认为的真正的友谊。在精灵中，个人之间100年的相识被认为是亲密关系的良好基础。",
								"为了与他们看似冷漠的性格保持一致，精灵们在面对悲剧时可能会显得冷漠和没有感情。他们确实能感受到其他人所感受到的痛苦，他们也确实为自己的损失感到悲痛。但他们也明白，以一种其他生物无法理解的方式，所有世俗的痛苦都是短暂的。而且，如果一个精灵对某项损失投入了太多的情感，那么这种经历可能会在未来几个世纪的恍惚中重现。在自己和他人的关切之间保持一定的距离，对精灵来说是最好的。",
								"尽管他们对别人的感情很吝啬，但大多数精灵对性格都有很好的判断力。因此，他们可以很快与其他生物形成表面上的联系。精灵常常在见到某人的几分钟内就知道这个新认识的人是否会成为旅行或冒险的合适伙伴，而且他们的第一印象很少出错--尽管可能要到几十年后关系才会变得深入人心。",
								"正如其他种族所定义的那样，耐心的品质在精灵身上是如此根深蒂固，以至于超越了第二本性。当敌人威胁要入侵他们的领地时，精灵们往往满足于在他们隐蔽的据点中等待危险的到来，而不是站出来战斗。为了避免流血事件的发生，一年甚至十年不受伤害是一个很小的代价--因为精灵们毕竟拥有世界上所有的时间。"

								"与他们对世界的长远看法和对世界历史的了解相一致，精灵们对道德有一种特殊的看法。他们遵守善与恶的传统定义，但又带着精灵的敏感。例如，当有人夺走他人的生命时，精灵们有一种独特的方式来伸张正义。",
								"像大多数文明的生物一样，精灵认为谋杀是严重的罪行，但他们关于惩罚的推理是他们自己的。凡人生物，如人类，谴责谋杀和那些犯下谋杀的人，因为它扼杀了一个生命。在涉及到凡人的生命时，精灵们也是这么看的。即使一个被谋杀的生物用魔法复活了，这也不能否定其罪行，就像更换被盗的黄金可以弥补最初的偷盗行为一样。但精灵并不像人类和其他生物那样是真正的凡人。如果一个精灵被杀，其灵魂会在某个不确定的时间后转世到一个新的身体里。只有死去的精灵的野心和当前的生活目标被切断；灵魂最终会得到另一个生活和实现的机会。",
								"由于精灵是转世，他们的社会将被杀精灵的家人和朋友视为谋杀案的真正受害者。幸存者必须在没有心爱的父母、孩子、伴侣、兄弟姐妹或伙伴的情况下继续生活，并可能在几个世纪里感受到这种损失。在这种情况下，正义是以他们的利益为导向，而不是为生命被终结的人复仇。对谋杀者的惩罚在某种程度上取决于犯罪的性质以及是否有预谋。它的形式可以是被放逐出社区，向幸存者支付一大笔钱，或者被迫继续从事被杀精灵所从事的任何未完成的工作。其中，流放是最严厉的惩罚。地表精灵对谋杀的态度--有些种族认为这种态度近乎轻率--被乌鸦带到了极端，他们把暗杀敌人和朋友都提升为一种艺术，他们认为杀人只是解决争端和为社会进步扫清道路的另一种工具。",
								"盗窃等财产犯罪通常被认为是重大性格缺陷的证据，因为精灵们不像寿命较短的种族那样重视物质财富。一件物品的内在价值是次要的，它的历史和情感价值可能是相当大的。一个偷了满满一袋宝石的精灵会被人同情，但偷了一朵她死去已久的姐姐送给精灵的干花的人，会被视为怪物，并可能被放逐出社区。"

For that reason, clerics are more common among the dwarves than in other races. Dwarves who are especially devoted to the clan are believed to have a special connection to the deities, and often learn how to use that conduit to bring forth divine magic.",
												"Arcane magic in all its forms is a different matter. Dwarves have no innate fear or hatred of such things, but arcane magic has no true patron among the dwarven deities. As such, the dwarves ignore it in their daily lives, and clan members who take up the practice are exceedingly rare. Using arcane magic to assist in the creation of one's works is anathema to almost all dwarves, because the act amounts to nothing more than cheating. The few dwarves who embrace arcane magic tend to venerate Abbathor, if only in secret."

										"Finally, Asmodeus confronted Laduguer. The Lord of the Nine laughed, joked, and cajoled with all his guile, but Laduguer remained grim and stoic, refusing to be affected even when the mightiest celestials might have admitted some grudging amusement at the devil's antics. Laduguer was resolute because he wanted one final treasure: the allegiance of Hell in the coming war against the mind flayers. Asmodeus offered a world's worth of other temptations, but Laduguer's countenance never changed. Even when Asmodeus relented at last, Laduguer accepted the arrangement as nothing less than his due and refused to display any reaction.",

Inspired by the great leader for whom the race is named, the gith rose up to overthrow the mind flayers that held them in servitude. But after they won their freedom, two factions among the gith disagreed on what kind of civilization they would forge. That disagreement quickly flared into open hostility, and the two groups distanced themselves from one another to pursue their separate agendas. They remain bitter enemies today, each side willing to fight to the death whenever they cross paths.",
				"The githyanki were motivated by revenge and convinced that they deserved to take whatever they wanted from the worlds they traveled. Ranging out from the titanic city of Tu'narath on the Astral Plane, they send raiders out to plunder the Material Plane and other worlds, bringing treasures and slaves back to their ageless realm. At the same time, they hunt down and kill mind flayers whenever possible, as recompense for what the illithids did to them.",
				"The githzerai believed that the path to an enlightened civilization lay in seclusion, not conflict. Their dedication to the principles of order is so strong that they can manipulate the stuff of chaos and use it to their benefit; thus, they have carved out a stronghold for themselves on the plane of Limbo that is virtually impervious. Though the githzerai are pacifists by nature, they share the githyanki's racial hatred for mind flayers, and from time to time they send out squads to destroy illithid outposts.",
				"If the two races were ever to team up against the illithids, a combined force of gith could conceivably tip the balance in their favor. But as long as the githyanki and githzerai stay at each other's throats, their goal of ultimate victory over their original common enemy will likely remain unachieved.",

Instead, the great red dragon Ephelomon brought news to the gith: Tiamat had pledged many of her red dragon servants to the gith cause. They would refrain from attacking gith and would provide support against the illithids and protection for the gith's outposts on the Material Plane. In return, a few select young dragons would serve alongside the gith for a time, for purposes known only to Tiamat.

Later, near the end of training, a drill of the same sort might be a fight to the death-the ultimate way of weeding out all those who don't meet Vlaakith's standards.

Vlaakith can still summon her people to action, and when she does so they obey her willingly. But when they aren't otherwise occupied, many of the citizens of the city spend their time in self-indulgent activities.",
								"For all her seeming invincibility, Vlaakith finds herself in an awkward situation that—in her paranoid mind—has no easy resolution. If she keeps her people busy more often by ordering an increase in raids, she risks her best warriors and marauders becoming experienced and powerful enough to challenge her rule. Also, if she sends out too many raiding parties at one time, the security of Tu'narath might be compromised. So she addresses the problem by not dealing with it directly, but by trying to encourage her indolent followers to find purpose in meaningful activities that don't involve plundering and killing.

While orcs, dwarves, and humans struggled, fought, and spilled blood to expand their territory, the elves noted that the halflings dwelled in a state of placid disregard, uncaring of the events of the world. They remarked on how the halflings enjoyed the simple pleasures of the moment, such as food and music, family, and friendship, and how they seemed to desire no more than that.

Halflings would welcome an orc with a good heart into their company and treat it as politely they would as an elf visitor.",
										"This openness doesn't extend all the way to naiveté. Halflings won't be taken in by merely a promise of good intentions, and their instinct for self-preservation makes them wary of any new \"friend\" that doesn't come across as genuine. Although they might not be able to define the feeling, halflings sense when something isn't quite right, keeping their distance from a questionable individual and advising others to do the same.",
										"This aspect of the halfling mind-set accounts for what members of other races often characterize as courage. A halfling about to enter the unknown doesn't feel fear as much as wonderment. Instead of being frightened, the halfling remains optimistic, confident of having a good story to tell when it's all over. Whether the situation requires a rogue slipping into a dragon's den or the local militia repelling an orc attack by refusing to yield, halflings surprise larger folk again and again with their unflappable nature."

										"As do many other races, halflings enjoy accumulating personal possessions. But unlike with most other races, a halfling's idea of value has little if anything to do with monetary concerns. A typical halfling's most prized possessions are those that have the most interesting stories attached to them. Indeed, entering an elderly halfling's home is much like opening a book of tales. Every nook and cranny contains some quaint curio or another, and its owner is more than happy to tell the story of where it came from. A halfling who has retired after a life of adventuring might own mementos as diverse as a spoon from Sigil's Great Bazaar, a pan pilfered from an elven kitchen in Evermeet, a rake received as a gift from a svirfneblin mushroom tender in the Underdark, and the scale of a white dragon acquired from its lair.",
										"Of course, most halflings' possessions aren't so exotic in origin. But even a stay-at-home halfling strives to collect everyday objects that played a significant role in an exciting story (such as \"the rolling pin that Aunt Hattie used to chase away a bugbear\" or \"the shoes that Timtom wore when he escaped from the wolf\"). Halflings believe that an item has a \"spirit\" of its own-the more dramatic or incredible its story, the stronger its spirit. This outlook prompts them to ask probing questions about the possessions of other folk they encounter-queries that can make them seem nosy to those who don't understand where they're coming from.",

A tale with all the trappings told by an elder can cause listeners to howl with laughter, long for home, sit on the edges of their seats, dream of far-off shores, choke up with emotion, or smile from ear to ear.",

It takes a combination of luck and persistence for an ordinary traveler to find such a place, and often that's not enough. For those who subscribe to the idea that Yondalla actively shields her worshipers from harm, this phenomenon is easily explained-she looks out for their homes just as she protects their lives. Whatever the reason, travelers might look for a halfling village, but they fail to notice a narrow path that cuts through the underbrush, or they find themselves traveling in circles and getting no closer to their goal. Rangers who have encountered halflings or lived among them know of this effect, and they learn to trust their other senses and their instincts rather than relying on sight.",

Since a halfling community usually has less than a hundred members, cooperation is critical to their society, and each resident performs regular chores or offers benefits that support the population. One family might provide baked goods, while another one cobbles shoes or knits clothing.

In one of these places, a youngster about to set out is celebrated with a rousing party that goes far into the night, during which the adventurer-to-be is regaled by tales of other \"fancy-footed\" heroes of halfling history."

Lightfoots prefer to live on the move in traveling bands, and their members are most likely to take to a life of adventuring.

Great mimics and vocalists, kender are consummate storytellers, but they often speak too fast for other races not accustomed to their frenetic cadence.",

They are lightly covered with hair over most of their bodies, especially on the backs of their hands and the tops of their feet, and they rarely wear shoes. The three subraces are the hairfeet, which are the most numerous; the tallfellows, which are the tallest and least athletic of the halflings, somewhat resembling elves; and the stouts, which are more akin to dwarves in temperament and stature than the other two.",
												"On the world of Athas in the Dark Sun setting, halflings are feral creatures, prone to devouring the flesh of humans and elves. Small, furtive and sunbronzed, they live a hard life under their chief, eking out a savage existence by hunting, foraging, and raiding. Outside their tribe, halflings are mistrusting, cynical, and often paranoid, since they think that all other races are as fond of devouring humanoids as they are."

One kobold, Kurtulmak, was arguably the craftiest of all kobolds. He sought other creatures to do the work in the kobolds' stead, and found a suitable victim in the gnomes. Because they were less aggressive than their tormentors, the gnomes fell under the sway of Kurtulmak's horde of kobolds.",

Every version of this story ends in some sort of tragedy-perhaps the loss of Gaerdal's hand, the affliction that caused Flandal to need new skin, or the disappearance of Baravar's shadow-and each one concludes with \"And that is why Garl sent Urdlen into exile.\" In tales of his later life, Urdlen is no longer a gnome but has become a greedy and destructive monster, a great blind and hairless mole with iron claws and teeth.",
