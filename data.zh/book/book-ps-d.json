						"当你读到这篇文章时，你应该已经听说了即将出版的《拉夫尼卡公会指南》的消息，我私下里把它称为 \"位面转移\"。拉夫尼卡\"。那本书是本期 \"位面转移 \"系列相对较晚的主要原因，因为我大脑中的D&D部分都在忙于编写它。但是那本书也是我在过去几年中为这个系列所做的所有工作的顶点。Plane Shift--以及你们对它压倒性的积极反应--为精装版的Ravnica书铺平了道路，证明了D&D/魔法的交叉是人们想要看到的东西。因此，你们对这个宠物项目的喜悦和热情直接导致了今年晚些时候《拉夫尼卡公会会长指南》的出版。谢谢你！\"。当我在2000年开始在Wizards of the Coast的D&D团队工作时，已经有一些关于在D&D和《魔法：聚集》之间做一个交叉产品的讨论。在当时，魔法或多或少是多米尼亚世界的代名词。因此，从某种程度上说，这一期的 \"位面转移 \"系列是经过了十八年的酝酿。当然，这项工作并不全面。一如既往，《魔法：集会-多米尼亚》的艺术是权威的资源，但即使是那本书也只能触及多米尼亚的表面。艺术书是建立在世界指南上的，而世界指南特别选择了世界上的十个地区--每个法力颜色两个--作为卡组的重点。在这十个地区中，有七个位于爱罗纳大陆上或周围，或者对其有重大影响。出于这个原因，我在本文中决定将重点放在领域上，省略了乌尔堡、希夫和亚维马亚等地区。我想，省略这些地区可以减少角色环游地球的诱惑，因为地球上有许多地区已经从美术书中省略了。也就是说，美术书中包含了一张完整的地图，互联网上也有很多关于多米尼亚的信息（特别是在{@link the Magic Website|https://magic.wizards.com/en}）。因此，如果你想把你的战役扩展到爱罗娜之外，你应该没有什么困难。本文的规则内容不多，主要是因为多米尼亚是最接近于D&D所借鉴的经典幻想的魔法。请自由地广泛使用类别选项、怪物和第五版D&D规则的其他部分（你可以（%1%））。再次感谢你对 \"位面转换 \"系列的支持，感谢你使更多令人激动的项目成为可能。"

								"Kavu are reptilian creatures that are either very ancient or a relatively recent creation on Dominaria. Either awakening from a millennia-long hibernation or springing fully formed into being, they emerged from the ground to defend against the Phyrexian Invasion. The Llanowar elves now breed the kavu to fill a variety of roles, believing that these creatures were the goddess Gaea's means of intervening in Dominaria's defense. The close relationship between elves and kavu is a constant reminder of Gaea's beneficence. Every Kelfae bonds with an arboreal kavu companion, and some Kelfae and Basiphem warriors ride them into battle.",
