						"La città santa di Elturel è scomparsa dai Reami Dimenticati ed è scesa in Avernus, il primo livello dei Nove Inferni. Questo evento è il risultato di un patto infernale tra l'arcidiavolo Zariel, che governa Avernus, e il perfido Alto Sorvegliante di Elturel, {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}. Zariel sta catturando le città e usando i loro cittadini come carne da macello nel conflitto in corso tra demoni e diavoli noto come la Guerra del Sangue. La prossima città sulla lista di Zariel è la vicina di Elturel, Baldur's Gate. I personaggi possono essere gli eroi che scendono in Avernus, salvano Elturel da una distruzione certa e impediscono che un destino simile si abbatta su Baldur's Gate.",

								"{@adventure Chapter 1|BGDIA|1} inizia nella città indipendente di Baldur's Gate, dove i personaggi si trovano intrappolati dietro le mura della città dopo che le porte sono state sigillate per tenere fuori centinaia di rifugiati dalla vicina terra di Elturgard. Tuttavia, le porte non possono trattenere la notizia che la capitale di Elturgard è caduta e che il Granduca {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA} di Baldur's Gate è scomparso, perso in una missione diplomatica a Elturel. Il fatto che la disgrazia di Elturel abbia coinciso con la visita di Ravengard ha lasciato i balduriani a chiedersi se Baldur's Gate subirà il destino di Elturel.",
								"I personaggi sono arruolati dal Pugno Fiammeggiante, l'esercito di mercenari incaricato di proteggere Baldur's Gate. Senza il Granduca {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA} a guidarli, i mercenari del Pugno Fiammeggiante sono poco più che teppisti esaltati. Gli ordini dei personaggi sono di aiutare a mantenere la pace estirpando e distruggendo i seguaci di Bane, Bhaal e Myrkul, divinità malvagie note collettivamente come i Tre Morti. Questi vili sacerdoti, assassini e negromanti stanno uccidendo la gente della città a caso, e il Pugno Fiammeggiante è troppo distratto e disorganizzato per dar loro la caccia e trovare il loro covo. Nel corso della loro indagine, i personaggi apprendono che i cultisti dei Tre Morti sono segretamente finanziati da Thalamra Vanthampur, uno dei tre duchi rimasti che presiedono il governo di Baldur's Gate, utilizzando il denaro rubato dal tesoro di Tiamat, la cattiva regina dei draghi imprigionata nei Nove Inferni.",
								"Con il Granduca {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA} fuori dai piedi, Thalamra sta pagando i Tre Morti per distruggere la fiducia nel Pugno Infuocato in modo che tutti i pagamenti all'organizzazione decapitata possano essere tagliati. Thalamra, una devota discepola dell'arcidiavolo Zariel, ha mediato un accordo che le permetterà di rivendicare il ruolo di granduca una volta che il Pugno Infuocato si sarà sciolto, aprendo la strada alla discesa della città in Avernus. Per realizzare quest'ultimo obiettivo, Thalamra ha bisogno di un artefatto chiamato lo {@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA}, nel quale è imprigionato un demone della fossa di nome Gargauth. Fino a poco tempo fa, lo scudo era sigillato in una tomba sotto la città, ma i figli di Thalamra lo hanno recentemente rubato e trasportato nei sotterranei sotto la loro villa. Lo scudo è così corrotto che la sua sola presenza a Baldur's Gate ha contribuito alla decadenza morale della città per decenni.",
								"Per evitare che Baldur's Gate cada nelle grinfie di Zariel, i personaggi devono portare lo scudo lontano dalla città. Reya Mantlemorn, un giovane cavaliere di Elturel, sospetta che i Vanthampur si stiano rifugiando {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA} nella loro tenuta e offre aiuto. I personaggi che assaltano la villa del duca Vanthampur trovano Thavius nascosto nelle segrete sottostanti. Thavius sta aiutando Thalamra Vanthampur a usare il {@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA} per far cadere Baldur's Gate, nello stesso modo in cui ha usato il Compagno (vedi \"{@area The Companion|007|x}\") per condannare Elturel. Se i personaggi uccidono Thavius, la sua anima viaggia verso i Nove Inferni e si riforma come un diavolo amnizu su Avernus (vedi \"\"{@area Poor Devil: Thavius Kreeg|2b8|x}\")."

Potrebbero anche liberare una spia imprigionata nei sotterranei del duca Vanthampur che lavora per {@creature Sylvira Savikas|BGDIA}, una tiefling esperta dei Nove Inferni. Determinata a contrastare gli adoratori del diavolo in posizioni di potere nelle Heartlands occidentali, Sylvira opera dalla biblioteca di Candlekeep e ha passato anni a monitorare l'attività del diavolo a Baldur's Gate, Elturel e nella regione circostante.

I personaggi sono invitati a cercare {@creature Sylvira Savikas|BGDIA} a Candlekeep. Sylvira conosce il segreto per sbloccare la scatola dei puzzle di Thavius. Può anche facilitare la discesa dei personaggi in Avernus e fornire loro una mappa (anche se inaffidabile). Sylvira consiglia ai personaggi di lasciare il {@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA} sotto la sua custodia. Tuttavia, ci sono vantaggi nel portare lo scudo con loro, perché Gargauth può guidarli attraverso i Nove Inferni in modi che gli altri non possono. Con o senza lo scudo, i personaggi lasciano Candlekeep e fanno visita all'amico di Sylvira, {@creature Traxigor|BGDIA}, un mago che può usare l'incantesimo {@spell plane shift} per portarli a Elturel.

L'assediato Ravengard esorta i personaggi a fare tutto il possibile per liberare Elturel e restituire a Faerûn ciò che ne rimane.

I personaggi che stringono un'alleanza con un signore della guerra rischiano di alienarsi gli altri. Acquisendo una macchina da guerra infernale, i personaggi possono viaggiare rapidamente attraverso Avernus, un dominio pieno di anime torturate, guerrafondai e diavoli desiderosi di tentare gli aspiranti eroi in accordi che corrodono l'anima.",

Dopo la caduta in disgrazia di Zariel, la spada è stata nascosta in una roccaforte chiamata la Cittadella Sanguinante, un santuario celeste intrappolato in Avernus. La ricerca della spada costituisce il punto cruciale di {@adventure chapter 4|BGDIA|7}, portando alla rivelazione che Zariel può essere redento.",
								"Il successo dei personaggi non dipende dall'acquisizione del {@item Sword of Zariel|BGDIA} o dall'aiutare Zariel a trovare la redenzione, come Gargauth si affretta a precisare se i personaggi si consultano con lui. Ci sono altri modi per liberare Elturel, ma solo se i personaggi sono disposti a fare accordi con gli abitanti più malvagi di Avernus. I personaggi potrebbero mediare un accordo con il deposto arcidiavolo {@creature Bel|BGDIA}, che desidera soppiantare Zariel e riconquistare il suo titolo di sovrano di Avernus. Potrebbero alimentare la rabbia di un orribile demone chiamato {@creature Crokek'toeck|BGDIA} e indurlo a rosicchiare le catene di Elturel.

Restituendo il suo tesoro rubato, i personaggi possono convincere Tiamat a spezzare le catene di Elturel.",
								"Per quanto allettanti possano essere questi inseguimenti, i personaggi devono stare attenti, perché i patti del diavolo, i signori dei demoni e la rabbia di Tiamat sono tra le più grandi minacce del multiverso. Inoltre, Zariel stessa potrebbe arrabbiarsi con i personaggi per aver osato intromettersi nei suoi affari diabolici. Come si conclude l'avventura dipende dalle scelte che i personaggi fanno, dal caos che fomentano e dagli accordi che stringono, come discusso in {@adventure chapter 5|BGDIA|8}.",

Molti dei guerrieri di Zariel combatterono coraggiosamente, ma per altri gli orrori dei Nove Inferni si rivelarono troppo grandi.

Quando la sua spada cadde a terra, Zariel ordinò a Yael, il suo generale più devoto, di prendere l'arma e nasconderla, in modo che i diavoli non la distruggessero o corrompessero. Yael prese la spada e fuggì, insieme al fedele compagno hollyphant di Zariel, {@creature Lulu|BGDIA}. Gli altri due generali di Zariel, Olanthius e Haruman, si rifiutarono di lasciare il fianco di Zariel. Tutti e tre furono catturati e mandati a Nessus, il più basso dei Nove Inferni. Lì, Zariel fu portata davanti ad Asmodeus, che la accolse a braccia aperte. Il Signore dei Nove lodò Zariel per la sua abilità in battaglia e la forza delle sue convinzioni. Le offrì il comando di Avernus, con grande dispiacere di {@creature Bel|BGDIA}. Giurando fedeltà ad Asmodeus e ai Nove Inferni, Zariel poteva portare la sua rabbia contro i demoni e continuare a combattere nella Guerra di Sangue, con legioni di demoni al suo comando. Zariel accettò le condizioni di Asmodeus, completando la sua caduta dalla grazia. Haruman seguì il suo padrone nella dannazione volontariamente e fu trasformato in un diavolo narzugon, mentre Olanthius, che si tolse la vita piuttosto che inchinarsi davanti ad Asmodeus, fu riportato a servire come cavaliere della morte sotto lo sguardo ardente di Zariel."

						"Come DM, puoi interpretare i diavoli come umoristici, distaccati, roboanti, conniventi o con la testa traballante, ma una regola generale da seguire è questa: i diavoli non hanno alcun desiderio di fare del bene. Quando hanno a che fare con i mortali, i diavoli pensano costantemente a come sfruttarli e corromperli, spesso dietro sottili sorrisi di finta preoccupazione e falso fascino.",

Nel frattempo, quando quel mortale muore, la sua anima si troverà condannata ai Nove Inferni dove si contorce nella forma di un {@creature lemure} (a meno che non venga usata per qualche altro scopo morboso). Al diavolo non interessa cosa diventa delle anime che corrompe; vuole solo essere promosso ad una forma superiore di diavolo. Ecco come, nel corso dei secoli, un {@creature lemure} può diventare un {@creature pit fiend}.",

Asmodeus afferma che servire nella sua legione infernale è un onore sacro, perché così facendo un diavolo aiuta a proteggere il multiverso dalla distruzione demoniaca. Anche se questo sembra impressionante, la maggior parte dei diavoli partecipano alla Guerra di Sangue solo per distinguersi tra i loro pari e salire nella catena di comando. Combattere senza sosta i demoni non è ciò per cui la maggior parte dei diavoli ha firmato.",

								"{@b Patience}. I diavoli raramente hanno fretta di fare un accordo o di firmare un contratto. Come maestri della truffa lunga, i diavoli fanno accordi genuinamente buoni con i mortali per comprare apprezzamento e fiducia che possono essere sfruttati durante accordi più consequenziali in seguito.",

I diavoli non hanno problemi ad apparire e ad agire in qualsiasi modo sia necessario per raggiungere il loro obiettivo finale, di solito un contratto per servizi o un'anima. Hanno imparato che si può ottenere di più comportandosi in modo civile piuttosto che reagire con rabbia o violenza.",
								"{@b Deviousness}. I diavoli non invecchiano, quindi raramente c'è un senso di urgenza con un diavolo mentre trama la sua conquista o corruzione di un'anima. Questo permette schemi tortuosi che raramente sono ciò che sembrano in superficie. Per i diavoli minori, una semplice accettazione di un dono malvagio è sufficiente, mentre i diavoli più grandi si divertono ad aggrovigliare i personaggi in scelte che compromettono i loro valori.",
								"{@b Unscrupulousness}. Essendo malvagio e senz'anima, un diavolo non può essere imbarazzato o svergognato, non prova senso di colpa o rimorso, ed è pronto a compiere gli atti più efferati per ottenere ciò che vuole.",
								"{@b Fear of Demotion}. Un diavolo che delude un superiore può essere retrocesso, al che si trasforma istantaneamente in una forma minore di diavolo. Più grande è il diavolo, più teme la retrocessione e la perdita del suo potere. Così, un diavolo si preoccupa di nascondere i suoi fallimenti o di attribuirli a qualcun altro."

				"Baldur's Gate iniziò come una città portuale dove i commercianti si incontravano con i \"accendini fantasma\", abitanti della Costa della Spada che usavano le luci per attirare a riva le navi bloccate dalla nebbia. Quando queste navi si incagliavano, i lumieri fantasma recuperavano i relitti e trasportavano le merci saccheggiate a Baldur's Gate, situata sulla riva nord di un'ansa del fiume Chionthar, e vendevano il loro bottino. Negli anni successivi, Baldur's Gate è diventata una città fortificata. Oggi, le sue strade nebbiose si tingono di rosso con il sangue degli sfortunati che cadono preda di opportunisti malvagi, molti dei quali si considerano nobili, commercianti, pirati e assassini. Un esercito di soldati mercenari chiamato il Pugno Fiammeggiante mantiene l'ordine in città, e questi soldati rispondono al Granduca {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA}. I membri del Pugno Fiammeggiante non si preoccupano della giustizia; bramano il potere e il denaro, nient'altro. Ma nonostante la reputazione di crudeltà del Pugno, il Granduca è ampiamente considerato un uomo onorevole e ragionevole.",
				"La città di Elturel, capitale di Elturgard, si trova molto più all'interno lungo il fiume Chionthar. Mentre Baldur's Gate ha la meritata reputazione di essere un nido di vipere, Elturel è vista come un faro di fede, ordine e alta cultura. Le due città hanno sopportato una lunga e aspra rivalità che ha avuto origine quando Baldur's Gate ha iniziato a rubare carichi e monete dalle navi dirette e provenienti da Elturel, soffocando il commercio marittimo di quella città. Sebbene i conflitti tra Baldur's Gate ed Elturel non siano mai sfociati in una guerra aperta, le relazioni tra le città sono state tese per molto tempo, troppo a lungo, secondo alcuni.",

Ravengard, tuttavia, non andò con entusiasmo. Ci vollero mesi di persuasione da parte dei suoi colleghi duchi, gli altri tre membri del Consiglio dei Quattro di Baldur's Gate, per convincerlo ad accettare l'invito di Elturel e lasciare la città nelle loro abili mani. {@creature Duke Thalamra Vanthampur|BGDIA} fu particolarmente convincente, avendo raccolto petizioni dalla nobiltà e dai leader della plebaglia comune.",
						"Non molto tempo dopo l'arrivo di Ravengard a Elturel, la città fu trascinata giù nei Nove Inferni e cancellata dalla mappa. Data la distanza tra le due città, non sorprende che gli abitanti di Baldur's Gate non abbiano saputo del destino di Elturel finché i rifugiati di Elturgard non sono arrivati in massa. Le voci sulla scomparsa di Elturel si diffusero a macchia d'olio, alimentando il timore che Baldur's Gate potesse essere la prossima. Allo stesso tempo, il panico travolse i ranghi del Pugno Fiammeggiante, che improvvisamente si ritrovò senza un leader forte.",

Il duca Portyr è arrivato al punto di richiamare sua nipote, Liara Portyr, dal suo posto di comandante del Pugno Fiammeggiante a Fort Beluarian a Chult, nella speranza che possa tenere il Pugno Fiammeggiante sotto controllo. Tuttavia, ci vorrà del tempo prima che la sua nave arrivi. Nel frattempo, i rifugiati di Elturgard continuano ad arrivare con terribili affermazioni che non rimane nulla di Elturel tranne un cratere nel terreno.",
						"Tra coloro che fuggono da Elturgard ci sono diversi Hellriders-paladini che hanno giurato di difendere Elturel. Questi guerrieri sono sfuggiti al destino della città solo perché non erano a Elturel quando è caduta, e il Pugno Fiammeggiante ha preso ad arrestarli a vista, per evitare che cerchino di creare problemi a Baldur's Gate. Gli Hellriders non se ne vanno in silenzio, tuttavia, portando alla violenza e allo spargimento di sangue."

												"The book is a testament written by Gideon in the months leading up to Elturel's fall. It pontificates about the evil of demons, instructing the reader to be ever vigilant against their incursions, and expounding that the demonic threat must be defeated at all costs. It praises the devils that stoically stand against the unending demonic tide, while chastising Helm, Torm, Tyr, Lathander, and their angelic servitors for not doing the same. Gideon has nothing but praise for Zariel's efforts to end the demonic threat. Any character who spends 10 minutes poring over the tome can conclude, with a successful DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check, that it's the work of a madman.",
												"Any character who continues to read the book beyond that basic level of understanding must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed check, the character is cursed with a particularly intense hatred of demons. A creature cursed in this way takes 5 ({@dice 1d10}) psychic damage if it can see any demon within 60 feet of it and ends its turn not having attempted to attack a demon. This curse can be removed with a {@spell remove curse} spell or similar magic. At the end of each long rest, a cursed creature can make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success."

The crimson flags of the ship referenced the brutal life of a pirate, blood spilled on the deck or in the water.

With the Flaming Fist too eager to punish criminal behavior by drubbing both accuser and accused, it's important that common folk have someone to watch their backs. That's why the people of Baldur's Gate created crews—collections of likeminded folk who band together for mutual protection.

This applies even to members of opposing crews, though anyone requesting sanctuary from a crew other than their own incurs a debt, both personally and on behalf of their crew.

From carpenters to grocers, the Forgeworkers' Lodge to the Wisewoman Weavers, nearly every profession offers some access to a crew.

As a side effect, it also means many patriars go months without engaging with the city's common folk, their insulation leading to the spread of divisive rumors.",
								"Patriars know the danger of the other districts, where their wealth is a lure and their names carry no weight. Patriars who have to travel the Lower City always do so with guards, and still risk robbery or worse violence.",

If circumstances force patriars to visit the Outer City personally, they typically travel in disguise, paying adventurers or mercenaries to protect them without drawing the attention of a uniformed personal guard.",
								"Among the common folk and criminal element of the city, patriars have a reputation for callousness. Common wisdom holds that patriars are out of touch with everyday life and value citizens' lives cheaply. For some nobles, this assessment holds true. These patriars are class-conscious dilettantes who spend their money on frivolous bets, debauched entertainment, and risky business ventures. For this callous lot, the common people are nothing more than fools to be bilked, clods undeserving of comfort and wealth due to their lack of comfort and breeding.",
								"For a few patriars, though, the inequality of Baldur's Gate is a serious concern. Blocked by a corrupt government and uncaring peers, these civic-minded nobles use unorthodox channels to distribute aid. They quietly fund vigilante action that protects the vulnerable groups. They stage robberies on their own property and secretly send the \"stolen goods\" to sick houses and charities. These patriars know that to act openly is to invite scorn from their peers, which may edge them out of alliances and deals that could strengthen their standing. Worse, it makes them targets for corrupt elite who prefer the city's divisions as they are.",
								"Some good-hearted but naïve patriars have been known to venture into the Lower City and even the Outer City to volunteer with the disadvantaged or share their wealth. Even in disguise, though, these nobles are usually quickly identified and become targets of the Guild or other criminals. More than one patriar on a mission of mercy has disappeared into the Lower City, never to be seen again.",

Assassination and murder underpin many of the plots in the city, from the business of highly-paid killers on patriar payrolls to slayings of opportunity committed by Outer City fanatics. Such bloodthirsty faithful rarely gather in numbers, but they typically mark themselves by carving a fresh gouge on their thumbs—spilling their blood in Bhaal's name while creating a subtle mark identifying that identifies them among allies. Despite the Lord of Murder's decentralized worship, some believe a temple to Bhaal exists near or under the city, possibly in an ancient chamber beneath the sewers or carved into Dusthawk Hill. Rumor holds that eleven red crystals on the wall of the temple grow brighter with every murder committed, gathering power for either Bhaal or one of his future chosen.

The Flaming Fist suspects a group of Bhaal worshipers behind a spate of recent similar murders, the victims stabbed to death and their own blood dribbled like a crown around their heads. The Fist's investigations have not yet resulted in an arrest, but officers suspect the murderers to be commoners with seemingly unremarkable lives covering their true, bloodthirsty natures.",
								"In the Upper City, murder brings results. Muggings and crimes of opportunity are rare here. The Watch keeps Upper City residents safe from criminals and riffraff. The biggest threat to patriars are other patriars.",
								"Bribery and blackmail can secure votes or sway an allegiance temporarily, but murder permanently changes the makeup of the Parliament of Peers. Several elite assassins exclusively take on political targets. The Watch puts little effort into tracking down expert assassins, knowing that arresting one means possibly exposing a whole cadre of powerful patriars. The wrath that would fall on the Watch isn't worth putting one assassin in the cells."

						"Today, Baldur's Gate is split into three districts: the wealthy Upper City on the hills above the docks, the bustling Lower City around the harbor, and the lawless Outer City (which includes all neighborhoods outside the city walls). Regardless of what district one might be visiting, certain features are impossible to ignore, like the wash of Gray Harbor, the shadows of Dusthawk Hill, or the gates that contribute to the city's name.",

								"Nine gates separate the districts of Baldur's Gate, providing the only points of entry to pass from the Upper City to the Lower City, or from the walled city proper to the Outer City and the wider world beyond. Baldurians, particularly if they do not wish to reveal a crew or family affiliation to a potentially hostile audience, often describe themselves by the nearest gate to their homes. Terms like \"Gondgater\" and \"Dragongater\" are widely understood as neighborhood identities, and are also understood as a way of eliding more troublesome connections.",
								"The Watch guards gates leading to the Upper City, while the Flaming Fist oversees the rest. Guards assigned to Baldur's Gate and Black Dragon Gate stay at sharp attention and seldom accept bribes. Those assigned to the smaller and more secluded gates, however, can be less attentive, particularly when distracted by jingling coins.",
								"Anyone entering the city must pay a nominal entry toll of 5 cp. While this is a small sum, it ensures that the truly destitute remain outside, consigned to the slums of the Outer City. Beggars and refugees crowd at the fringes of these slums, typically around Black Dragon Gate and Basilisk Gate, pleading for money to pay the toll and hoping that the guards won't drive them off for annoying more prosperous travelers.",
								"When the city is not under lockdown, merchants pour through the external gates from morning till night, while peddlers, delivery carriers, and servants move in equally swift streams through the inner gates. Toll collectors work quickly but methodically to inspect incoming and outgoing trade goods, ensuring that commerce flows smoothly and the city gets its share at every turn.",
								"The city gates are closed at night. At dusk, the Watch evicts anyone from the Upper City who is not a patriar, bearing a patriar's livery or permission letter, or carrying a Watch-issued token. The enforcement of this rule is one of the means by which the Upper City reinforces its snobbery over the other districts. More than one Lower City merchant visiting an Upper City restaurant or theater near sundown has been embarrassed by a Watch member's loud, public caution that the gates are about to close. While being seen hurrying toward the gates is an obvious embarrassment, being caught and escorted out would be far more bruising—both to one's ego and body.",
								"The nightly closing of the gates ostensibly keeps the patriars safe. Closing off the Upper City pushes street crime into poorer neighborhoods, or out of the city altogether. In the Upper City, patriars can walk down alleys with relatively little fear, but beyond its well-lit streets and tightly watched gates, the other districts become much more dangerous after dark."

								"One of the largest and deepest harbors on Faerûn's western coast, Gray Harbor is also one of the busiest. The city's independence and general laissez-faire attitude toward the types of goods and people flowing through its port—so long as the government gets its cut—means that the harbor throngs with both honest captains conducting forthright trade and pirate crews looking to fence their wares. Plenty of sailors also make their homes nearby in the Lower City.",
								"The harbor's most immediately striking feature is its machinery, with dozens of enormous cranes and countless powered scoops and cargo carts dramatically accelerating the loading and unloading process. Though designed by the Church of Gond, these marvels are run by the Harborhands, the most powerful crew in the city thanks to the dockworkers' ability to shut off the city's economic lifeblood with a strike. Managing the whole affair is Harbormaster Darus Kelinoth, a lawful neutral male human {@creature noble} who runs the port's operations and taxation from a small, heavily fortified brick building set well apart from other structures.",
								"The port itself is a tangle of piers, floating docks, and anchorages, from the massive Freighter's Finger pier catering to the heaviest barges to the more ordinary slips at Northtree or Commonsdock. Not actually attached to shore, the chaotic Flotilla is the city's cheapest long-term moorage option, where boats are welcome to raft together around common anchor buoys, and where some houseboats haven't moved in generations. A special division of the Flaming Fist called the Gray Wavers patrols the harbor, yet it's no secret that the more expensive docks are safer than the budget options. Sailors and even whole ships have been known to go missing in Gray Harbor, and while some assume such disappearances are the result of local shore-based pirates, others speak of Ol' Cholms, a mysterious sea beast capable of dragging ships down to the river's lightless bottom."

								"Local legend holds that the dusthawk was Balduran's favorite hunting bird, and that the Chionthar population is descended from his own personal hunting hawks. When the dukes of Baldur's Gate realized that the dusthawk was on the verge of extinction, they declared the hill, which included both the hawks' cliffside nests and their hunting grounds, to be off limits to unlicensed hunters. Despite the fences and cliffs that cordon off most of the hill, trespassers remain common, the demand for dusthawk hunting birds having exploded among the wealthy.",
								"Many in the Outer City resent the hill being turned into private land. Several camps and slums were cleared as a result, their dwellers losing everything. The homeless resent the patriars for being willing to spend money giving hawks a home, but not them. Others resent the Flaming Fist guards who keep them from trapping on the hill. Stringy rabbits and scrawny quail made poor meals, but they were meals, and now many hunters have none.",
								"Rumors hold that werewolves lair in the sea caves under Dusthawk Hill, pretending to be ordinary smugglers—or ordinary animals—while plotting against the city. Whenever a grisly murder captures Baldurians' imaginations, someone is always quick to claim that it must be one of the Dusthawk werewolves who did the deed."

The Watch is merciless about turning beggars and malcontents away from the gates, where an erratically enforced entry toll for non-residents and those without Watch tokens or escorts effectively bars the poor from setting foot within this district. A patriar caught outside the Upper City after dark, therefore, is at high risk of robbery, beating, or worse.",

								"The Old Wall, built at Balduran's behest centuries ago, surrounds the Upper City. Six gates pierce it, channeling the district's visitors and commerce. Entering the Upper City requires either being a patriar, having a patriar's letter or livery, showing a Watch token issued to the Upper City's residents or licensed to its few inns for guest use, or paying an entry toll. Tokens and tolls are only accepted at Citadel Gate, Baldur's Gate, and the Black Dragon Gate, since the other gates are reserved for the exclusive use of patriars, their servants, and their guests.",
								"{@b Black Dragon Gate}. Named for the dragon's head that a victorious knight once hung upon its arch, the Black Dragon Gate faces the road heading north toward distant Waterdeep. The original dragon's head is long gone, but a stone replacement snarls above the gate's arch. Local legend claims that the stone head will magically spew acid at attackers if the city should ever fall under siege.",
								"{@b Citadel Gate}. The only entrance to the Watch's fortress, Citadel Gate nestles into the Upper City's landward wall. The Watch maintains a small cavalry, nominally for defense and crowd control, but primarily for parades, honor escorts, and other ceremonial functions. Because of this, the Citadel maintains the only stable within the city walls.",
								"{@b Patriar Gates}. The four gates known collectively as the patriar gates—Gond Gate, Heap Gate, Manor Gate, and Sea Gate—are smaller and are generally not accessible by the general public. They were built after the construction of the Lower City walls and were intended to offer patriars convenient access from their homes to their business concerns and back. Privately funded by the patriars, and thus serving as a display of their personal success, these gates are more ornate and tightly guarded than the public gates. Officially, none may use them without bearing a patriar's livery or letter of permission, although rumors persist that Guild kingpins and veteran servants among several patriar staffs know exactly which guards to bend. Regardless, the visible double standard imposed at these gates is a constant gall to Lower City residents forced to take longer routes through the public gates because they cannot use the ones in their own neighborhoods."

Beyond the Citadel, this neighborhood includes many shops and the comparatively modest, though still grand, houses that belong to the few non-patriar residents of the Upper City.",

Each push for renewal saw a conflict between Gondan engineers advocating for new building techniques and materials, and patriars and preservationists striving to protect the original architecture. Meanwhile, smugglers and Guild agents bribed building crews, altered blueprints, and otherwise put their fingers in the plans at every turn to steer reinforcement efforts away from their own secret passageways or induce builders to make new ones.",

Both buildings are decorated with adventuring trophies both exotic and mundane, including a bronze-horned marble unicorn bust in the Helm's common room. Its horn, which patrons often rub for good luck, is as shiny as the day it was made.",
										"The Helm and Cloak has long attracted idealistic sons and daughters from patriar families. For generations, these young romantics, taking the god Lurue as their inspiration, have called themselves the Knights of the Unicorn. Over time, what began as a light-hearted lark became a real force for good in the world, and several of the early knights achieved renown for their heroics. Today, the Knights of the Unicorn continue to call the Helm and Cloak their informal headquarters. The establishment is even run by two retired members, Vedren and Halesta (neutral good human {@creature Knight||knights}). The couple's presence shapes the inn's clientele significantly, and the unicorn bust in the Helm's common room honors their origins in this place."

Unless an impartial witness or evidence of questionable circumstances is brought to the court's attention, the word of a Flaming Fist or Watch officer suffices to convict, and the judge has only to stamp a seal on the paperwork that the guards have already prepared. This results in a certain degree of corruption, naturally, which is compounded by the proxy judge's near-absolute discretion in deciding whether to accept a conviction or exonerate a suspect. Bribery and influence-peddling run rife through the courts, where honest judges are rare and widely feared.",

The libraries don't share a common index, and sorting through their overlapping and idiosyncratically organized holdings can be confusing, so most people opt to pay one of the resident librarians to locate what they need.",

										"Patronized by all levels of society, Baldur's Mouth is the city's primary news service and gossip rag. Utilizing a small army of lantern bearers, the Mouth spreads news both by selling broadsheets on street corners and by shouting summaries of top stories at passersby. From the slums of the Outer City to the finest manor house sitting rooms, the Mouth is where Baldurians go to be informed, incited, and pleasantly scandalized. While some of the news—such as word of new laws passed by the Council of Four or official election results—is handed down directly by the government, most comes from freelance journalists, and official pronouncements often sit side by side with scathing editorials or unflattering political cartoons of those same officials.",
										"Ettvard Needle, a chaotic good male human {@creature commoner}, runs the operation from a surprisingly modest converted warehouse in Heapside. The son of an established Lower City tailor, he had always rankled at the way Lower City residents were treated by haughty patriars, and started Baldur's Mouth as a way to empower the city's poor via what he saw as the greatest weapon of social change: information. In the beginning, he simply paid local lantern bearers to shout his stories of upper-crust injustices, but as enthusiasm for the practice built and more people began bringing him information, he began writing the stories down for his distributors—teaching many of them to read in the process—and then selling the notes directly. Today, Needle prints his broadsheets by the cartload, aided by mechanical scribes purchased from the Hall of Wonders and funded by advertisements from merchants across the city.",
										"Though beholden to advertisers and tacitly sanctioned by the city government, the Mouth has never lost its populist bent. Needle carefully ensures that the paper is useful enough to the government that it's never in their interest to shut it down, yet devotes the rest of the paper to news the government might prefer hushed up, from aristocratic scandal and evidence of corruption to straight talk about various threats to the city, always with a healthy dose of anti-elite rhetoric. His editorials have a particular soft spot for his friend {@creature Rilsa Rael|BGDIA}, the Guild kingpin of Little Calimshan. While Needle loathes the Guild, he sees in Rilsa's egalitarian tendencies the potential for a hero of the people, and naively hopes she'll transform the Guild from a predatory criminal organization into a community police force serving the city's downtrodden.",
										"Baldur's Mouth is a prime source of opportunity for adventurers in the city, as Needle is always looking to hire daring \"investigative reporters\" willing to investigate rumors of strange happenings or procure proof of corruption by the city's elite. Even just reading the broadsheet can present adventure opportunities via advertisements recruiting mercenaries, half-substantiated reports of monster attacks ignored by the Flaming Fist, and more. And of course, should adventurers succeed or fail in some high-profile venture, they might just find caricatures of themselves and stories of their exploits in the Mouth's latest edition."

The former innkeeper of the Blade and Stars, a chaotic neutral half-orc {@creature bandit} named Aurayaun, used to insist that the illusory effect was the shield's only magic, and that it did exactly what she intended it to do: draw in business.",

Since then, though, Lupin has received parcels containing pieces of the shattered shield, each bearing a tiny constellation upon it.

Instead, its plethora of back rooms and antechambers act as de facto offices for the menagerie of shady characters who spend their days drinking here. Ostensibly retired sailors, the bar's regulars are in fact contacts for a variety of unsavory organizations, from smugglers and bandits to fences, drug dealers, and panderers. Some work for the Guild, others for operations all along the Sword Coast. Those looking to do business with the Gate's underworld find that a handful of silver in the Mermaid can open doors, but the wrong word can find you dumped {@condition unconscious} in the alley out back.

Eventually the local government got involved after several overly ambitious patriar scions vanished on ventures hastily outfitted by Eastway Expeditions. Now Shilvin can sell her modest selection of goods and any jungle-related gear only after a ten-day waiting period, helping to ensure that fewer citizens rush off to Chult unprepared. To make up for the resulting loss of business, Shilvin has made connections with several trading (and piratical) ventures in regular need of crew.

While patriars might still be able to afford house calls and personal priests and physicians, commoners funded the building of a single large facility where everyone could come for treatment. Eager to no longer have every worship service interrupted by contagious congregants, several of the city's temples were only too happy to provide clerics to work in the facility. Of course, coin still determines one's quality of care, the clerics rarely work for free, and those without sufficient funds generally end up in the ominously stained basement with the chirurgeons-in-training—but at least those in need know where they can go for help.

Unlike Merilyn, the Reveler's Union—the city-spanning crew of night-workers—isn't averse to selling secrets teased from the bathhouse's clients, and those looking to purchase such information need only whisper in the right ear here.

These arboreal visions of the future are often cryptic, yet inevitably come to pass. As much as the city's elite would love to harness this power, anyone else attempting to peel the tree's bark or force a prophecy reveals only bark and sends Torimesh into a near-murderous rage.

Three levels of dungeons extend beneath it, the lower two below sea level and integrating part of a naturally occurring cavern system. This both keeps the prison secure and pacifies prisoners, as any who act out know that they can always be moved from the dry cells to the dank lower levels. Particularly problematic inmates end up in the Swimming Hole—a flooded and lightless shaft where prisoners must constantly tread water or risk drowning, while also fending off the blind, biting shrimp that dwell there. Though long-term incarceration is rare in the city, there are always a few inmates rotting in these cells, ranging from petty criminals to political prisoners locked away on trumped-up charges.",
										"Characters who run seriously afoul of the law in Baldur's Gate might wind up in the Seatower. While the Fist treats the prison as something of an afterthought, any trying to break in or out of the dungeons still have their work cut out for them. Only the upper cells have windows, and anyone trying to break through the walls of the lower cells risks catastrophic flooding. Sentries are constantly on alert for ships drawing suspiciously near the island, and no one is allowed through the fortress's gate without a reason and an escort. Cells themselves have heavy steel doors with high-quality locks, with the keys held by Jailer Albrecht Little, a lawful neutral male human {@creature gladiator}, or his second, Jailer Cogrus Stonehammer, a lawful neutral female shield dwarf {@creature knight}. Soldiers are often assigned to \"cell duty\" as a temporary punishment—while this generally means rougher treatment for prisoners, the regular turnover might present a sliver of opportunity for anyone attempting a rescue."

										"Ambitious and thoroughly amoral, Skoond rose to prominence as the Council of Four's wizard, doing regular favors for the council to further his own plots. Though rarely home, he boards four alchemist lackeys in the building, along with several guards, using the secret passages to cover their comings and goings. Their only job is to uncover and map out as many of the building's secrets as possible—one of the histories Skoond read suggested that the building's original architect had died while smuggling a rare magical tome, leading him to suspect that it still lies hidden in the house's walls.",

Drawn up through hidden tunnels by the magical auras of both the tome and neighboring Mandorcai's Mansion, a {@creature nothic} lurks in the house's passages, using them to spy on the wizards and search for the treasure. So far, none of the residents have detected it—the last person to do so was the previous owner, killed by the nothic's rotting gaze.

										"Shortly after Balduran disappeared for the final time, this statue appeared on the cliffs of Tumbledown. Twice the size of the actual man, the statue bears an uncanny likeness to Balduran, squinting west over city and river. While its sudden arrival created something of a stir, most assumed it was simply a tribute to the great man—until one morning several months later when passersby noticed that one of the statue's hands had risen to shade its eyes. Scholars immediately began studying the statue, learning that at sunrise on the first day of each new year, the statue flickers, changing its position in an eyeblink. Though it always looks west, the precise line of its gaze can change by up to thirty degrees, and it may peer through a spyglass, stand with hands on hips, point with an open hand, and so on.",
										"For centuries, the predominant theory was that Balduran still lived somewhere far to the west, and the statue tracked his movements. Yet a generation ago, a knight of Oghma vowed to follow the line of the statue's gaze as far as necessary to learn the truth. His journey was shorter than expected. In a wood just a few miles west of the city, he came upon a cylindrical stone building, its open doorway revealing stairs leading down into the forest floor. Atop the building, a smaller statue of Balduran stared back the way he had come. Prevented from entering by a pattern of magical lights he couldn't identify, the knight raced back to the city to gather additional scholars—yet when he returned, the structure was gone. Since then, the forested structure—which popular stories now refer to as Balduran's Tomb—has been discovered three more times in the same fashion, each time in a different location, yet so far no one has been able to enter."

										"The value of land and sheer population density in Baldur's Gate means only the wealthiest patriars can afford to bury their dead within the city, interring them in catacombs beneath the city's temples or in family crypts on their own grounds. For everyone else, there's the ignoble Shrine of the Suffering or the scattering of cemeteries outside the city. The largest of the latter is Cliffside Cemetery, located in the Tumbledown neighborhood and employing many local residents as gravediggers, stonemasons, morticians, and professional mourners.",
										"Long ago, the graveyard was an empty estate owned by the mercantile Szarr family, with only a few family crypts near the cliffs. When a business rival murdered the entire family in their beds, no one was eager to move into their former manor, and the city decided to turn the estate into a single massive graveyard that acts as the primary repository for the city's dead.",
										"The graveyard itself is a maze of crypts and monuments, its organization nearly impossible for outsiders to discern as the multi-chamber ossuaries of rich merchants and pirate lords loom over the simple plaques and rotting wooden holy symbols of the poor. Natural cavern systems have been expanded and shored up to create extensive crypts, yet over generations maps have been lost or poorly updated, and it's not uncommon for a gravedigger to find themselves striking the wood of a coffin where no coffin should be, or tumbling through into a forgotten stretch of tunnel. Rampant grave robbery by brigands and necromancy-obsessed followers of Myrkul only increases the chaos, as bodies get exhumed and reburied wherever it's convenient. Most significantly, a major landslide decades ago dropped a large portion of the cemetery's cliff into the river below, causing the remaining bone-houses and markers to shift and lean, while also exposing numerous crypts and tomb-tunnels to the air, prompting a fresh rush of grave robbing. Though Baldurians rarely bury their dead with valuables anymore, and many of the easier pickings have been taken, it's common wisdom that some of the greatest treasures of past centuries still lie entombed with their heroes, their headstones wiped anonymously clean by wind and rain.",
										"Watching over all of this is the powerful Gravemakers crew. Far more than simply caretakers and laborers, the Gravemakers guard the dead—and Tumbledown—from threats. With so much death concentrated in one spot, undead are a constant problem. Skeletons and revenants regularly claw spontaneously out of their graves, while ghouls and ghasts burrow into crypts and catacombs, drawn by the scent of decaying flesh. Wights hide in their tombs by day, while ghosts and wraiths terrorize unsuspecting mortals. Putting down such threats before they can prey on citizens is the Gravemakers' primary job, and though rightfully proud of their prowess, their leader Leone Wen, a lawful good female human {@creature knight} and servant of Torm, is always looking for fresh recruits or contractors to join them in their crusade. The crew operates out of the half-burned old Szarr Mansion in the cemetery's center, its moldering halls reputedly still infested by the ghosts of the murdered Szarrs—though stories remain split as to whether the ghosts prey on the Gravemakers or aid them in their duty."

How Mother Aramina learns of individuals' distress and under what circumstances she offers free room and board in her facility is something of a mystery, but as of yet, none have discovered any sinister angle to her work. In fact, Mother Aramina has been known to hire empathic intermediaries to help extricate the needful from destructive conditions. Despite its charity, though, the Church of Last Hope is not universally loved. The Faithless, the Guild-associated gang in Twin Songs, see a trove of wealthy city-dwellers and wishy-washy non-priests in their midst, ripe targets for protection schemes, kidnappings, and all manner of other plots. Currently none of the Church's patients have been endangered, but Mother Aramina is cautiously looking for more permanent security solutions."

Presiding over the crammed shelves is Entharl Danthelon, a neutral good male shield dwarf {@creature commoner} who claims to have been an adventurer once himself, as evidenced by the magical flying axe that guards his shop at night. Customers are inevitably treated to the story of the grateful elven princess who enchanted the axe for him as a reward for a daring adventure undertaken on her behalf.",
										"In truth, Danthelon's \"dancing axe\" is actually a tame {@creature stirge} wrapped in the illusion of a double-bladed axe, which Danthelon sets loose each night. The illusion is courtesy of Yssra Brackrel, a neutral female half-elf {@creature mage} and brilliant hairstylist who rents out the shop's attic. Yssra's cantankerousness is as legendary as the shop's flying axe, and anyone seeking just her spellcasting is subject to a frank and unflattering critique of their current coiffure.",
										"While Danthelon may never have been a real adventurer, he loves associating with them, and constantly keeps his ears open for rumors and opportunities, which he happily passes along to paying customers. At the moment, he's obsessed with reports of a group of smugglers who recently went missing in the Riverveins tunnels along with a chest full of valuable magic potions, and eagerly encourages his shoppers to investigate—and then return to tell him the story."

Of these, the largest is Garynmor Stables, which offers the unique benefit of operating locations in both Stonyeyes and Blackgate; those travelers passing through have the option of leaving their beasts on one side of the city and picking them up on the other, after grooms have ferried them around the outside of the walls. The stables are also unusual in their willingness to rent mounts to city residents in need of transportation, cutting down on the need of city dwellers to own their own horses. Yet the true gem setting Garynmor Stables apart is its menagerie.",

His menagerie in Stonyeyes contains a variety of rare creatures both mundane and magical, from an aged cockatrice and two wing-clipped hippogriffs to an owlbear. Always on the lookout for new attractions, he happily pays adventurers for healthy specimens of rare creatures, sometimes reselling the smaller and less dangerous species. While the menagerie is popular with city folk who pay a few coppers to view the creatures, many neighbors fear that Ubis doesn't take security seriously enough, and that his desire to coddle such dangerous beasts could lead to them breaking free and rampaging through the district."

Yet it's the citizens themselves who should be nervous, for the slaughterhouse recently came under new management.",

He engineered the death of the slaughterhouse's former owner so that he could take over, figuring that constant blood, offal, and animal screams would provide a suitable cover for the cult's murderous activities. Since then, he's been slowly laying off existing workers and replacing them with cultists loyal to the group's mission. Assisting him are Corian Khee, a {@creature death's head of Bhaal|BGDIA} who spends days crushing livestock skulls with a massive hammer and nights leading the cult's murderous field operations, and Jaemus Exheltarion, a half-elf {@creature master of souls|BGDIA}. Of the three, Jaemus is the least convincing in his role as the slaughterhouse's new accountant, as he greets customers with an eerie stare, openly reads strange-looking tomes, and spends entirely too much time in the cult's trophy locker, a cold-storage facility where he's using pieces harvested from victims and livestock to construct a ram-headed flesh golem."

										"Generations ago, a fleet of Calishite refugees fleeing war in the south came sailing into Gray Harbor. Rather than opening their doors to the foreigners, the people of Baldur's Gate quickly hustled them out of the city, forcing them out the Basilisk Gate in the middle of the night and taxing them for the privilege. Desperate and weary, the refugees finally found succor in a caravanserai run by a fellow Calishite in the Outer City. There they used what little wealth they'd been able to bring with them to construct a new home—a traditional Calishite settlement that would be precisely as friendly to Baldur's Gate as the Baldurians had been to them.",
										"Though much time has passed since that ignominious beginning, tensions remain high between Little Calimshan and the rest of the city, particularly with regard to those Baldurians living in the city proper. Unlike most of the Outer City, where neighborhoods blend into each other and no one can quite say where one ends and another begins, Little Calimshan is sharply defined by brick-and-plaster walls, 15 feet tall, 5 feet thick, and topped with minarets in the classic Calishite style. These walls don't simply surround the neighborhood, either. Little Calimshan is built like a traditional Calishite city in miniature, with its interior divided into multiple drudachs (neighborhoods). Each drudach is walled off and inhabited by a particular family or tribe, with its own religious site, inn or tavern, marketplace, and places of industry such as smithies, armories, tanneries, or mills. While such an abundance of walls might make Little Calimshan seem fractious and standoffish, in fact the opposite is true: the thick wall walks act as elevated streets, with locals able to look out over the layout from above and easily pick a path to their intended destination.",
										"Second only to the Wide in the chaos and liveliness of its markets, Little Calimshan opens its gates to outsiders for just a few hours each day. Inside its warren of bazaars, local merchants have a near-monopoly on many southern imports, from silks and fine blades of Calishite steel to tomes of rare magical lore, thanks to exclusive trade agreements with various caravans. As soon as mid-afternoon arrives, however, shoppers are shuffled back out the arched gates, and the only non-Calishites still allowed within the neighborhood are those who've married into a Little Calimshan family or otherwise earned the sacred trust of a drudach's residents. While many residents of Little Calimshan venture into the larger city for business or pleasure, not even the Flaming Fist is able to force its way into the neighborhood-turned-fortress after hours except in the direst circumstances, and each drudach is instead patrolled by a militia of young unmarried warriors ({@creature Guard||guards} with scimitars instead of spears) called amlakkars.",

Income inequality is made all the more obvious by density, with paupers living literally side-by-side with wealthy genie-binders. Older isolationists clash with young folk eager for more interaction with the wider city. Yet by far the largest issue is the gang war currently ravaging Little Calimshan. Seeing the Guild as fundamentally an outsider organization, a Calishite gang called the Right Pashas seeks to oust Guild agents from Little Calimshan's underworld. The Guild's popular half-Calishite kingpin, {@creature Rilsa Rael|BGDIA}, naturally objects to this insult, and each night residents bar their doors tight as a turf war of thugs and thieves rages across their rooftops.",
										"Among Little Calimshan's most notorious locations is the Calim Jewel Emporium, widely regarded as the best jeweler in the city—and the best place to fence stolen gems, as it's also the local Guild headquarters. In addition to hosting regular public forums in her shop, Rael tacitly oversees the Garden of Whispers, a maze of wood-and-paper screens where people from across the city can buy and sell secrets with Guild agents and each other, speaking through the barriers so as to maintain anonymity. Also popular are schools like the Lamp of Learning and the Verdashir Academy (also known as the Dervish Academy), which train spellcasters and warriors in the styles of their ancestral homeland, allowing only the most talented outsiders to access their archives or join in their lessons. And, of course, every patriar in the city has visited the famous Oasis Theater, home of the city's most daring—and sometimes dangerous—productions."

Productions involve everything from live monsters to powerful illusion magic, while also showcasing the most talented performers in the city. Actors and musicians perform their songs and monologues from atop flaming trapezes or human towers, while acrobats shock the audience with physical feats bordering on the supernatural.",

The fact that these performances sometimes go terribly awry, with monsters breaking loose or a broken piece of equipment sending a performer plummeting into the crowd, only adds to the excitement, and patriars and common folk alike vie for seats at the theater's afternoon-only performances. Ticket prices are decided capriciously and on the spot by Goodnight, varying wildly between any given individual.",

The cost of putting on his outrageous shows has landed him deep in debt, and his compulsive need to roast every potential patron or ally in the city hasn't helped matters. With the Guild ready to step in and assume ownership if he doesn't start repaying his loans, he needs to either turn to outright crime or put on a show more amazing than anything he's done before.

Ramshackle wooden tenements, taverns, and shops crowd both sides of the arched stone spans, leaning out over the narrow road between them. Even more cling to the sides of the bridges, anchored to each other or cantilevered over the water. The tendency of these latter structures to occasionally drop into the rushing river, pulling their neighbors down with them, is not enough to deter residents who hope to be the first to sell to travelers on their way into the city, or the last to pick their pockets on the way out.",

At the same time, it also has a large and tight-knit strongheart halfling community, whose low-ceilinged tenements and lighter weight are perfect for the neighborhood's precarious architectural style.",

Between twenty-five and fifty Flaming Fist soldiers staff the checkpoint, which operates only during the day.

Soldiers stationed in the fortress tend to fall into two categories: those disappointed at being stuck on toll-collection duty so far from the city, and those overjoyed at easy work and a chance to carouse in Wyrm's Crossing, with the latter ensuring that the Fist doesn't patrol their neighboring bridges too heavily.",
