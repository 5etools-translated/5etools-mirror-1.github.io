						"La dottoressa Cassee Dannell, brillante accademica, ha imparato da tempo a nascondere il suo interesse per l'occulto. Ha invece costruito una carriera acquisendo competenze sui popoli e le culture della regione circostante Varkenbluff, continuando la sua ricerca occulta in segreto. All'età di ventiquattro anni, la dottoressa Dannell aveva conseguito il dottorato in antropologia presso l'Università di Varkenbluff, una prestigiosa istituzione della sua città natale. La sua capacità di collegare gli oggetti archeologici locali con il loro contesto culturale era impareggiabile, così, dopo la laurea, la dottoressa Dannell divenne membro della facoltà di Varkenbluff e scienziata sul campo, accompagnando le squadre di archeologi dell'università negli scavi della zona.il museo, rubare l'uovo e restituirlo alla dottoressa Cassee Dannell per essere neutralizzato prima che rilasci un orrore ultraterreno.",
						"Durante una recente spedizione nel vicino Murkmire, gli archeologi hanno portato alla luce uno strano oggetto. Verde chiaro, opaco e con una lucentezza simile a quella delle pietre preziose, questa pietra ovoidale era ricoperta da strani solchi. La pietra sembrava di natura rituale, ma non corrispondeva a nessuna pratica storica registrata e nessuno era in grado di identificarne la composizione. Più la dottoressa Dannell la studiava, più si convinceva che questo oggetto, che gli archeologi avevano soprannominato Pietra di Murkmire, non era stato creato da nessuna civiltà conosciuta e poteva essere pericoloso. Dannell divenne membro della facoltà di Varkenbluff e scienziato sul campo, accompagnando le squadre di archeologi dell'università negli scavi della zona.il museo, rubare l'uovo e restituirlo al Dr. Cassee Dannell per essere neutralizzato prima che sprigioni un orrore eldritico.",
						"La dottoressa Dannell cercò di convincere gli archeologi dello scavo a isolare la Pietra di Murkmire fino a quando non avesse potuto saperne di più, ma la notizia della scoperta si diffuse rapidamente. Quando il Museo di Storia Naturale di Varkenbluff offrì un prezzo generoso per la pietra, questa fu ben presto trasportata dal sito di scavo al museo.

						"La dottoressa Dannell continuò a fare ricerche sulla strana pietra. La sua preoccupazione si trasformò in terrore quando trovò descrizioni di oggetti simili nei suoi tomi sull'occulto. Questi oggetti erano, in effetti, uova di creature ultraterrene. Apprese che tali uova giacciono dormienti per generazioni, ma una volta dissotterrate, le creature al loro interno si sviluppano e si schiudono rapidamente. Le creature che ne derivano sono fameliche di carne cruda e crescono esponenzialmente mentre si nutrono, finendo per sopraffare interi villaggi. Le uova sono quasi indistruttibili, ma i tomi affermano che incastonarle nel cristallo può neutralizzarle.rkenbluff membro della facoltà e scienziato sul campo, accompagna le squadre di archeologia dell'università negli scavi della zona.il museo, ruba l'uovo e lo restituisce al dottor Cassee Dannell per essere neutralizzato prima che liberi un orrore infernale.",

La dottoressa ha presentato freneticamente le sue scoperte agli amministratori dell'università, che hanno giudicato il suo lavoro pseudoscienza e si sono rifiutati di interferire con l'imminente mostra della Pietra di Murkmire al museo. Disperata, la dottoressa Dannell si intrufolò nel museo dopo l'orario di chiusura e cercò di rubare la pietra, ma fu catturata. L'università ha rinnegato le sue azioni e l'ha licenziata.

Shortly after Frody was interred, a tiefling named {@creature Sythian Skalderang|KftGV}, who lived many miles away, learned of the famous bard's untimely death.",
						"Sythian had inherited his parents' estate and debts, but a mysterious poison killed off the family's olive orchard, leaving him with nothing but the mansion and its furnishings. Those furnishings included a multitude of musical instruments Sythian's parents had bought in the hopes of making him a musical prodigy. While he excelled at none of the instruments, he realized he could pay off his family's debts by turning his home into a conservatory for young musicians from wealthy families. One of his current students, Wylie van Timmel, shows great promise. Sythian hatched a plan to snatch Golden Axe from Frody's grave and give it to Wylie as a present, hoping to earn the favor and long-term financial support of her wealthy family.",
						"Sythian hired a pair of halflings named Mackerel Mudbottom and Trout Bonanza to dig up Frody's remains and pry the Canaith mandolin from his hands. They did just that, leaving behind an open grave. After the halflings fled with the mandolin, Frody awakened, crawled from his coffin, shambled to his mother's old cabin, and knocked on the door. The young family living there fled in terror at the sight of him and took shelter in a neighbor's barn. The good folks of Toadhop have been on edge ever since.",
						"The characters arrive in Toadhop and quickly discover that someone has disturbed the grave of a famous bard named Froderic Dartwild and that Frody's corpse is \"none too happy about it.\" Locals ask the characters to speak with Frody, who is holed up in a cabin on the outskirts of the hamlet. From Frody's zombified corpse, the characters learn that the stolen mandolin is called Golden Axe. They also learn the identities of the grave robbers who stole the mandolin, as Frody's restless spirit heard the halflings refer to each other by name before they inadvertently animated his corpse. Frody refuses to return to his grave until the mandolin is returned to him.",
						"If the characters agree to retrieve the mandolin, they find Mackerel and Trout at their riverside abode, five miles from Toadhop. The two halflings reveal that their employer, {@creature Sythian Skalderang|KftGV}, has Golden Axe in his possession and plans to give it to one of his students. Stealing Golden Axe from Skalderang Conservatory forms the crux of this adventure. Ideally, at least one character in the party should be a bard.",

						"The Silver Fingers Society is no mere guild of pickpockets and ruffians. The elite thieves of this multinational organization pull off impossible heists, targeting crown jewels, national secrets, and other heavily guarded prizes. Decades ago, the elf Nixylanna Vidorant joined the Silver Fingers, where she partnered with a dwarf named Samphith Goldenbeard. These friendly rivals made a good pair. Vidorant was skilled with picking locks and deftly getting into tough places, and Goldenbeard used his connections and quick thinking to research targets and talk the pair's way out of trouble.",
						"As the years passed, the duo rose in the ranks of the Silver Fingers. But their partnership abruptly ended when they stole the Ruby Diadem, an heirloom once worn by Queen Erlynn Blessedore. Goldenbeard's family traces its lineage to the dwarven queen, who was captured in a battle centuries ago, and he desperately wanted to reclaim his family's diadem. The heist seemed like any other—until thirty guards suddenly surrounded the pair of thieves. Vidorant nimbly escaped via the roof with the diadem in hand, but Goldenbeard was caught. He avoided imprisonment by calling in favors with powerful friends, but when he tracked down Vidorant, she refused to hand over the diadem despite his family's claim to it.",
						"Goldenbeard claimed Vidorant set him up and alerted the authorities. Meanwhile, Vidorant claimed innocence, insisting Goldenbeard was covering for his own inability to escape the situation. Whatever the truth, she kept the diadem, the once-friendly rivalry turned bitter, and the two have tried to outmaneuver each other ever since.",
						"Recently, their uneasy relationship changed again with the death of the longtime leader of the Silver Fingers Society. Vidorant and Goldenbeard each competed to win leadership of the society, calling in favors from every ally they had in the organization. Unfortunately for Vidorant, Goldenbeard proved defter at internal politics, winning leadership of the society—and getting Vidorant expelled in the process. Goldenbeard promised harsh retaliation against anyone who helped Vidorant, ensuring none of her former allies would stand against him.",
						"Weeks after his takeover of the Silver Fingers Society, Goldenbeard made an even bigger move against Vidorant. He promised a favor to any existing or aspiring Silver Finger who steals the Ruby Diadem of Erlynn Blessedore and delivers it to him. This challenge is the talk of scoundrel circles as everyone vies to steal the diadem from Vidorant. Doing so won't be easy, as Vidorant keeps her treasures in her secure vault on the outskirts of the city."
