Solo che ora, la ricerca perduta di Kwalish è disperatamente necessaria! Oserai una spedizione alternativa nei Picchi della Barriera per trovarlo?",
				"Come offerta speciale a sostegno di Extra Life 2018, siamo lieti di presentare il seguente scenario di avventura, costruito intorno a una nuova spedizione ai leggendari Picchi di Barriera. Questa avventura è adatta a personaggi dal 5° al 10° livello.",

						"Nei secoli passati, un comune studioso di nome Kwalish prese una strada improbabile per diventare uno dei più potenti inventori arcani di tutti i tempi, dopo la sua scoperta di una strana magia nei Picchi di Barriera. I suoi studi su un'antica imbarcazione planare che si è schiantata lo hanno messo su un percorso che avrebbe potuto farlo rivaleggiare con Ioun e Heward, fino a quando i suoi esperimenti lo hanno superato e lui si è perso nei secoli. Tutto ciò che è rimasto della sua eredità è un singolo esempio del suo primo lavoro - il {@item Apparatus of Kwalish} che è l'unico modo in cui la maggior parte della gente ora conosce il suo nome.",
						"Fu l'incursione di Kwalish nei Picchi di Barriera che mise in moto i suoi studi avanzati, quando si unì a una spedizione sfortunata alla ricerca di Daoine Gloine, una città leggendaria che si diceva fosse popolata da creature di vetro. Anche se il resto del suo gruppo perì lungo la strada, Kwalish si imbatté in un relitto di un'imbarcazione planare di provvidenza sconosciuta e passò anni ad esplorarne i segreti. Ha persino riutilizzato gran parte della tecnologia magica unica dell'imbarcazione nel suo primo laboratorio, costruendo porte planari di sua progettazione.",
						"Il test di una di queste porte, che creava una connessione con i Nove Inferni, attirò l'attenzione di un diavolo d'ossa. Inseguendo Kwalish attraverso i piani, il diavolo si impadronì del laboratorio dell'inventore. Kwalish riuscì a fuggire, ma si lasciò dietro gran parte del suo sapere, mentre il diavolo d'ossa passò gli anni successivi a convertire il luogo in un oscuro monastero e a stabilire il proprio culto.",
						"Dopo molte peregrinazioni tra le montagne, Kwalish si trasferì in un luogo altrettanto remoto: Maoine Gloine, la misteriosa città che la sua spedizione aveva originariamente cercato. L'isolamento del sito lo rendeva un luogo adatto per continuare le sue ricerche. Tuttavia, i suoi abitanti non erano creature di vetro come le leggende suggerivano, ma clan di kenku che adoravano una medusa con la capacità unica di trasformare le sue vittime in vetro.",
						"Prima che Kwalish potesse subire la stessa sorte per mano dei caotici kenku e della loro folle medusa, aprì ancora una volta una porta planare, questa volta verso il 222° strato dell'Abisso-Juiblex's Slime Pits, da cui evocò un'orribile piaga di melma per ripulire la città e aiutarlo a difendere il suo nuovo laboratorio.",
						"Kwalish tagliò ogni accesso a Daoine Gloine e la città si perse nei secoli. Da allora non si è più sentito parlare del leggendario inventore. Solo ora, i personaggi hanno un disperato bisogno del suo aiuto...",

Le informazioni raccolte da Anaxi nel corso degli anni hanno tracciato il percorso di Kwalish nei Picchi di Barriera, almeno fino al punto in cui la sua spedizione si è persa, nonostante le formidabili conoscenze e abilità dei suoi membri.",
						"Facendosi strada tra i Picchi della Barriera, i personaggi arrivano infine al primo laboratorio di Kwalish: i resti di una nave planare la cui tecnologia ha guidato le prime ricerche dell'inventore. Ma scoprono che Kwalish è stato esiliato da tempo e che il suo laboratorio è stato trasformato in un monastero ora dedicato al diavolo d'ossa che è il Gran Maestro del sito. I personaggi devono negoziare il loro ingresso nel monastero, e da lì al suo tesoro. Nascosti all'interno del tesoro ci sono appunti della spedizione originale di Kwalish che conducono a Daoine Gloine, la leggendaria città nelle profondità dei Picchi della Barriera e il sito dell'attuale laboratorio di Kwalish.",

Una volta raggiunto il laboratorio, i personaggi incontrano il leggendario inventore e possono negoziare l'assistenza necessaria per completare la loro missione e potrebbero anche avere la possibilità di aiutare Kwalish a risolvere uno dei suoi problemi.",

The second device has a flying speed of 40 feet, and can be flown remotely under the creature's control as part of its own movement. The remote device also grants the creature a sensory awareness of the area around it. This allows the appendage to be used normally, so that the creature can undertake any activity remotely that it could accomplish close up, including making physical ability checks and attacks.",

If the characters manage to secure a pair of such devices, you can let the players come up with novel ways to make use of them in those locations (assigning appropriate Intelligence checks if you want to make the process difficult). However, they can't be claimed as treasure."

Once the sphinx is slain—or if the characters killed it before coming to the monastery—any ability checks made to deal with the brains are made with advantage."

						"A secret entrance might be concealed behind the Grand Master's throne in area M3, opening to reveal a spidery contraption resembling an iron golem, and operating as a climbing elevator down into the lower decks. Another entrance might be concealed within one of the immured ones' cells at area M6. Opening the cell could reveal the entrance standing open, with the prisoner gone and residing somewhere below.",

Characters are fully conscious and ambulatory while in such a state, their heads operating independently of their bodies until both are reunited.

Kwalish might also ask for their aid in restoring the city to its former state.",
