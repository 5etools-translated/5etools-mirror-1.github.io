Una sottile striscia di civiltà si estende lungo questa costa, dove città molto distanziate sono disposte come perline su un filo. Le strade collegano vagamente le città che si estendono da Luskan a nord a Calimport a sud, passando per Neverwinter, Waterdeep, Baldur's Gate e altri porti lungo la strada. La maggior parte di questa avventura si svolge nel tratto tra Baldur's Gate e Neverwinter.",

Con la maschera assemblata, il culto può liberare Tiamat dalla sua prigione nei Nove Inferni.",

I rapimenti e le incursioni intraprese dal Culto del Drago aumentano ogni giorno, e i rifugiati fuggono dalle regioni bruciate sotto l'attacco del culto verso le principali città e fortezze. Gli abitanti dei villaggi hanno abbandonato le loro case, fuggendo dalla costante predazione dei draghi. In molte città, il panico totale ha creato un movimento crescente a favore dell'accettazione delle richieste del culto nella speranza di ottenere concessioni in cambio. È difficile radunare le truppe quando la gente ha paura di essere bruciata dal fuoco dei draghi. Questo è il momento per gli eroi di ispirare il popolo della Costa della Spada con una o due grandi vittorie. Fortunatamente, i Forgotten Realms hanno proprio un gruppo di eroi di questo tipo.",

I draghi cromatici sono malvagi e spietati, e ogni battaglia contro queste creature dovrebbe essere una lotta di vita o di morte. Nessun drago dovrebbe mai cadere senza che gli eroi soffrano durante la battaglia. I draghi cromatici usano ogni possibile vantaggio senza alcun riguardo per la correttezza, e il loro vantaggio principale è il volo. Un drago non combatte mai a piedi, dove i nemici potrebbero colpirlo, quando può librarsi maestosamente fuori dalla portata e massacrare i nemici con la sua arma del respiro. Solo nella sua tana un drago si impegna tipicamente nel corpo a corpo, e solo se il suo tesoro è minacciato.",

Se i personaggi non possono farlo da soli, i loro alleati nell'Ordine del Guanto o gli Arpisti dovrebbero essere disposti a dare una mano.",
										"Con una vita di mille anni o più da perdere, i draghi cromatici non hanno interesse a morire in battaglia contro semplici umanoidi, e non si sacrificano nobilmente per nessuna causa - Tiamat incluso. Un drago sorpreso in una battaglia persa prende qualsiasi via di fuga che gli si presenti, il più delle volte semplicemente volando via. Questo cambia durante la resa dei conti finale al Pozzo dei Draghi, tuttavia, quando Tiamat può essere visto mentre si fa strada attraverso il portale dai Nove Inferni."

La gente comune conosce gli Zhentarim come le persone a cui rivolgersi quando si ha bisogno delle migliori guardie o mercenari che il denaro possa comprare. E se il carico è losco o la causa per cui stai combattendo è discutibile o addirittura ingiusta, agli Zhentarim non importa.",
								"L'affiliazione con gli Zhentarim può essere vantaggiosa per venditori, ladri e furfanti di ogni tipo. È plausibile che gli avventurieri della tua campagna possano diventare membri dell'organizzazione, ma come la maggior parte degli abitanti di Faerûn, non conosceranno l'intera portata delle operazioni e degli obiettivi degli Zhentarim.",
								"Sconosciuto a tutti tranne che a pochi, il cuore degli Zhentarim è una cabala di capi malvagi e a volte mostruosi che cercano di estendere la portata della Rete Nera intrisa di sangue in ogni assassinio, mercato nero e affare illegale che avviene a Faerûn. Le connessioni criminali dell'ordine penetrano in ogni grande città e gilda di ladri nelle Heartlands occidentali e lungo la Costa della Spada. Ovunque la moneta di una città sia disastrosamente minata dalla contraffazione, ovunque un'impresa emergente abbia la meglio sulla concorrenza, e ovunque una lotta politica si trasformi in un'intimidazione diffusa, è sicuro che gli Zhentarim siano coinvolti.",
								"Tuttavia, impegnarsi nella corruzione tradizionale e voler vedere Tiamat ascendere sono due cose diverse. Gli Zhentarim non si fanno illusioni su cosa significherebbe il ritorno della Regina dei Draghi per i loro piani. Volendo governare segretamente il mondo dall'ombra per se stessi, i leader della Rete Nera non hanno alcun desiderio di diventare agenti e galoppini per qualche dio meschino e le sue coorti di draghi.",
								"Questo punto di vista rende gli Zhentarim un'interessante aggiunta ai possibili alleati dei personaggi. In circostanze normali, gli Arpisti, l'Alleanza dei Signori, l'Ordine del Guanto e l'Enclave di Smeraldo eviterebbero i legami con la Rete Nera ed eventualmente arresterebbero i suoi emissari. Tuttavia, la crisi creata dal Culto del Drago è senza precedenti. Ogni risorsa che può essere radunata sarà necessaria nella resa dei conti finale contro il culto, e la rete di spie, assassini ed eserciti mercenari degli Zhentarim non può essere ignorata.",
								"Anche se il destino del mondo e il futuro stesso degli Zhentarim sono in bilico, l'ordine esige un pagamento per i suoi servizi, e dove il bisogno e il rischio sono maggiori, ci si aspetta che la paga sia altrettanto grande. Questo atteggiamento mercenario non piace all'Alleanza dei Signori, tuttavia, e loro sono l'unico gruppo con le risorse per pagare il prezzo della Rete Nera. Gli eroi possono tentare di influenzare le opinioni delle altre fazioni e hanno la possibilità di comprare la fedeltà degli Zhentarim nel seguito di {@adventure chapter 15|RoT|6}.",
								"Alla fine, la posta in gioco è troppo alta per rimanere seduti in questa battaglia, e gli Zhentarim scendono in campo contro il culto indipendentemente dal fatto che il loro prezzo sia pagato. Tuttavia, se le altre fazioni vogliono avere voce in capitolo su come gli Zhentarim entrano in guerra contro il culto, questo costerà loro. Se gli Zhentarim combattono da soli, colpiscono quando e come vogliono.",

All'insaputa di chiunque al di fuori degli Zhentarim, uno dei loro agenti si è infiltrato nel culto e si avvicina abbastanza al Wyrmspeaker Varram per rubare il {@i White Dragon Mask}.

If they don't, and they're traveling with others, then the NPCs they're traveling with suggest that an immediate attack might turn the tide or at least save many lives. If characters still sit out this fight, they see about half of the attackers leave around midnight, with the rest retiring in small groups over the next few hours. When the sun comes up, even a quick inspection shows that over half of the buildings are heavily damaged and much of the town's wealth was carried away.

He has been severely beaten, and he has been denied food and water in an effort to break his spirit. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} knows from informants across the Sword Coast that Leosin has been researching the cult's history and recent activity. The wyrmspeaker wants to know how much Leosin has learned and with whom he shared his information. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} considered it an amazing stroke of luck that Leosin was captured during the raid.",
								"In fact, it wasn't luck at all, at least not for {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}. Leosin had studied their previous attacks and concluded that the time was right for the cult to strike a bigger target, and he knew that Greenest was prosperous yet poorly defended, making it the most likely next target. So, when he deemed the time was just about right, he visited the town with the intent of staying until something happened. His observations paid off, and Leosin separated from his people during the night and fell in with the raiders when they retreated, hoping to learn more about the cult's plans and the location of their camp. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} spotted him after the sun came up, and the monk was quickly overpowered and captured.",
								"That portion of Leosin's scheme has worked reasonably well. He now knows most of the information listed above under \"Exploring the Camp.\" Unfortunately for him, captivity has been more brutal than he expected, and although his mind and will are still strong, he's in a very poor physical state.",
								"Despite the danger, Leosin isn't entirely happy about being rescued if characters come to set him free. He believes he can learn more, and he's willing to take the risk. He's too weak to resist, however, so characters can easily take him away against his will if that's what they want to do. He can move without aid at a speed of 20 feet and fights as a commoner with disadvantage on attack rolls. If characters don't bring him out of the camp, Leosin breaks away on his own. He refuses to talk about it later.",
								"If characters are captured and imprisoned alongside Leosin and their attempts to escape fall through, he reveals that he has a small knife hidden in his boot. They can use it to cut their bonds. Leosin's absence is noticed within five minutes if he is taken away, and an alarm goes up throughout the camp. Rigging up a dummy in his place delays the discovery by twenty minutes. Tying up a dead or {@condition unconscious} cultist (preferably a half-elf) in his place assures the intruders a two-hour head start before the escape is noticed."

Merchants from different companies commonly join together to form larger trains for protection. Frume has contacts among the many merchants of the region and is certain he can arrange a job.",
								"Timing is an issue. The tracks leaving the cultists' camp and the map from Mondath's chamber both indicate that the wagons were heading west to pick up the Coast Way road, where they would turn north to Beregost and Baldur's Gate, a journey of about 550 miles. The wagons would take twenty-five to thirty days for that trip, depending on conditions. The wagons pulled out at least a day ahead of the characters' return to the camp, and the characters probably spent a day exploring the abandoned camp and clearing out the dragon hatchery. Returning to Greenest, resting, and traveling to Elturel account for eight to ten more days. Unless the characters walked to Elturel or lounged for days in Greenest before coming north, they should have at least ten to fifteen days before the cult's wagons reach Baldur's Gate.",
								"The River Chionthar flows directly from Elturel to Baldur's Gate. A sailing vessel can make that trip downstream in about three days if it ties up overnight for safety, or two if it risks pushing on through the night by lamplight. Frume has already arranged for such a boat to leave at dawn the next morning. They are also provided with 50 gp each to cover expenses on the trip.",
								"If the characters turn down this mission, Frume makes some remarks about how they aren't the people he thought they were, and he leaves the meeting more than a little bit angry. Erlanthar stays and makes one more appeal to their sense of honor and duty. If the characters still turn him down, he reaches into his tunic and pulls out a soft leather pouch, which he hands to one of the characters. Inside is a magnificent ruby worth 1,200 gp. He explains that if they take the mission, this ruby will be waiting for them in the hands of a Harper agent in Waterdeep.",
								"That night, Frume sees that the characters are all equipped with new clothing and gear, and even new weapons if they want. He suggests that they change their appearance as much as they can in simple ways, to reduce the odds of anyone they might have met at the cult camp recognizing them.",
								"The trip downriver to Baldur's Gate is uneventful, regardless of whether it takes three days or two. The characters can bring their horses along on the boat if they wish. The horses won't like it, but they'll manage."

						"Baldur's Gate is a bustling center of trade, with goods coming from north and south by wagon along the Trade Way and by ship on the Sea of Swords, and from the east along the River Chionthar and from Cormyr and Sembia. Baldur's Gate is situated on a prominent bluff next to the river, overlooking an excellent natural harbor. It is divided into three distinct segments: the Upper City where the richest and most influential citizens live and where the city's marketplace (the Wide) is located; the Lower City, which surrounds the harbor and where most of the city's merchants live and conduct their business; and the Outer City, which lies outside the walls and where most of the city's laborers reside in conditions that vary from crowded but clean to squalid.",
						"Depending on timing, characters might have just a few days to wait in Baldur's Gate, or up to a tenday. Most of that time should be spent contacting a merchant recommended by Frume and arranging affairs so they can spot the cult wagons when they arrive.",
						"Frume's contact is a human trader named Ackyn Selebon. He operates an equipage business in the Outer City north of the city wall, in a district called Blackgate. There he sells all the material needed for long-distance freight hauling: wagons, rope, netting, grease, chains, wheels, and so on. His shop also repairs wagons. He is not directly involved in the hiring of guards for caravans, but he knows people who are. With him to vouch for the characters, they should have no trouble getting hired on as guards for a northbound caravan, but he can't give them work with a specific merchant.",

								"Baldur's Gate doesn't allow wagons, pack animals, horses, or even dogs into the city. The streets are so narrow, steep, and slick from frequent rain that heavy wagons would be a menace. This is actually one of the reasons why Baldur's Gate is such a bustling commercial hub: for goods to pass through the city from south to north, for example, they must be unloaded in the Outer City east of the wall, carried through the city by porters on foot, and reloaded onto different wagons north of the city for the rest of their journey. No road conveniently bypasses the city—a situation that the gate's profiteering intermediaries work hard to maintain. Most merchants find it easier to sell their loads to those intermediaries and consignment dealers when they reach Baldur's Gate, buy a new load of exotic goods from somewhere far away, and turn around and head back home, where they can again sell the new goods at a profit.",
								"Along with wagons, guards seldom make a continuous journey through Baldur's Gate. Guards for northbound caravans are typically hired in Blackgate where northbound wagons begin their journey. Selebon tells the characters that if they hang around any of the taverns or tent saloons near his shop, they are sure to see all the northbound traffic. They shouldn't hesitate to use him as a reference if a potential employer asks for one.",
								"The northbound journey from Baldur's Gate is arduous, so merchants travel together for safety. Each merchant hires guards independently, but the common belief is that if everyone hires two or three and enough wagons travel together, the caravan is well protected.",
								"Within a few days (the wait is up to you and the timing you've worked out for the cargo's arrival from the camp), characters spot people they recognize from the cult's camp on the plateau. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}, being a half-dragon, can't travel openly in Baldur's Gate; she'd be attacked by a mob. The city's wealthy elite, however, often travel the streets in screened or curtained palanquins for both comfort and privacy. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} does the same. When characters spot familiar faces from the cult camp, the cultists are carrying or accompanying a palanquin where {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} rides. They might catch a glimpse of her through a briefly parted curtain if they're observant.",
								"{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} and her bodyguards come to Selebon's yard to purchase five wagons and supplies (having sold the other wagons south of the city). Once they are equipped, local porters pack merchandise and supplies onto the wagons, cover them in canvas, and lash them down.",
								"After the characters have identified the cultists' wagons and seen their arrangements, they should have an easy time getting hired as guards. They can apply to the cultists if they feel like being reckless, but other merchants are making the same preparations to leave on the morrow. Select anyone from the list of merchants and travelers to be a potential employer. Each character makes a Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) or Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check, whichever they prefer.

Red Wizards are widely disliked and mistrusted, so he takes some pains to disguise his membership in that group by always wearing a wool cap with ear and neck flaps to cover his shaved, tattooed head. It's not an especially effective disguise; characters who make a successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check notice the edges of the tattoos peeking out from under the cap. Many Thayans have shaved, tattooed heads, however, but only a few are Red Wizards. Countless Thayans fled their country when the lich Szass Tam seized control, so they are not entirely strange on the Sword Coast. If questioned, Jos claims to be just another Thayan expatriot trying to find refuge while his country is controlled by undead monsters. In fact, other than the denial that he's a Red Wizard, this is all true.",
								"Jos buys space aboard one of the cult wagons, although they turned away everyone else who sought passage earlier in the journey. He does not mingle with the other travelers and seldom speaks to anyone except the man who seems to be the leader of the cultists.",
								"{@creature Jamna Gleamsilver|HotDQ} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12} for statistics) is a female gnome and a member of a secretive organization called the Black Network, also known as the Zhentarim. Outwardly, the Black Network provides mercenaries and other forms of muscle for hire. Informally, it is known as a criminal society akin to a widespread thieves guild. Secretly, its leaders seek to extend their shadowy fingers into every throne room and ruling council chamber in Faerûn. Like the Harpers, the Zhentarim too are aware that the Cult of the Dragon is on the move, and they need to know the cult's plans so they can prevent them from interfering with the Zhentarim's own plans, plus perhaps take advantage of the plunder possibilities.",
								"That's why Gleamsilver joins the caravan. The Black Network's spies learned that the cult is moving freight northward, and, like the characters, she was tasked with finding out what they're hauling and where it's headed. Those above her seriously considered wiping out the caravan with mercenaries disguised as bandits, ransacking the wagons, and torturing cult members for the desired information. Fortunately for the characters, Gleamsilver persuaded her superiors to give her a shot at uncovering the truth in a less bloody fashion. If she hasn't come up with something useful by the time the caravan reaches Waterdeep, she will put plan B—the one involving mass murder—into action.",
								"Despite the vast gulf between their outlooks, the Black Network and the Harpers have a common enemy, and that is pushing them into an unlikely alliance. Gleamsilver is the antithesis of a hero—she is self-serving, a skilled thief and liar, and willing to murder anyone who stands between her and her goal."

Everyone remembers the incident; chromatic half-dragons are almost never seen, and they tend to cause alarm when they are. If the rumor is true, then the half-dragon was traveling with a strong escort of mounted guards, headed north. The rumor is true, of course, but it can't be confirmed 100 percent.",
						"By asking around, characters learn that the road to the north, called the High Road, used to connect Waterdeep to the city of Neverwinter. A cold, coastal marsh called the Mere of Dead Men lay between the road and the coast. Over the years, the mere continually expanded. Each time it grew, it flooded the road, which had to be relocated farther inland. That was the situation until a century ago, when Neverwinter was nearly destroyed by the eruption of Mount Hotenow. With the city in ruins, efforts to keep the road open simply stopped. It no longer served a purpose.",
						"But now, Lord Neverember is rebuilding Neverwinter and the road is needed again. The warehouse visited by the cultists is where shipments of supplies to the road-building camps are coordinated. If freight haulers went there, it must have been to see if they could haul supplies to the road-head for pay. Are they hiring guards for supply caravans? Sure, you bet they are. The Mere of Dead Men is wild and dangerous. Lord Neverember's agents in this endeavor are perpetually looking for laborers to build the road and fighters to protect the laborers. Turnover in those jobs is pretty high."

He lived there a relatively short time before the growing swamp flowed past the castle on all sides and made the location too remote for even his taste. After the structure sat abandoned for years, a group of astrologers called the Academy of Stargazers claimed it. They built an observatory into the top level of the keep, where they installed a piece of magic equipment called the {@i farseer of Illusk}. But the astrologers vanished mysteriously after a few years.",

It was built to withstand its cold, watery environment, so the encroaching water hasn't undermined the walls or flooded the dungeon. Over decades of abandonment, however, it filled with debris and attracted many unpleasant dwellers. Then {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} happened upon the castle on one of her trips into the mere to study and negotiate with the black dragon Voaraghamanthar. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} suspected the castle could become a useful stronghold for her, being located so conveniently close to the lair of a black dragon. She explored the structure, cleared the giant spiders out of the tower, and forged an alliance with the nearby tribe of bullywugs.",

When she discovered the portal in the dungeon and learned that it connected to an abandoned lodge in the Graypeak Mountains, a new thought took shape.

When the time is right, Pharblex plans to remove the elf from the picture by any means necessary. It is unlikely that he would choose the middle of a battle against the characters, when he and Borngray are fighting side by side, to betray the elf—but it's not impossible. If it looks like the cult's operation at the castle is doomed, Pharblex is the sort of creature who will switch sides to save his slimy skin.

They have grown accustomed to seeing cultists of many races coming and going around the castle, so when they see strangers, their first assumption is that the newcomers are more cultists. This assumption is reinforced if Snapjaw or other lizardfolk accompany the strangers or if the characters have any overtly cultish gear or clothing.",

When {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} promised that Voaraghamanthar would reward the tribe's labors for the cult, the lizardfolk were ready to listen.",
										"Where the bullywugs fill the role of a static defense force, the lizardfolk perform five functions. First, they are the cult's laborers and porters. Lizardfolk did most of the heavy work while clearing debris from the castle, and they carry most of the treasure from the work camp to the castle on their backs and in their canoes. Second, they tend the giant lizards that are used to drag or carry especially heavy loads through the mere. Third, they do most of the hunting, fishing, and gathering to feed everyone at the castle. Fourth, they act as the castle's far-ranging scouts and outlying guards, since they are far superior to any bullywug at actively patrolling, ambushing, and laying traps. Fifth, a cadre of lizardfolk has been enlisted as elite guards for the castle itself. Borngray doesn't expect that any force would ever mount a real attack against the castle; it's too inaccessible, lying deep in the swamp. But if that unlikely event ever happened, he knows that the swaggering bullywugs would desert rather than fight an organized enemy. The lizardfolk, on the other hand, can be courageous and disciplined when they have a leader worth following. Borngray hopes to be that leader, at least to the small contingent of lizardfolk warriors he houses in the castle and rewards with special treatment. In exchange for their work, Borngray \"pays\" the tribe in metal weapons that are brought to the castle along with the loot.",
										"Meanwhile, the bullywugs boss and bully the lizardfolk, emboldened by their superior numbers, the lizardfolk's instinctive awe of Pharblex's magic, and the absence of any restraining sign from Borngray or from the lair of the black dragon. Voaraghamanthar's silence, more than anything else, makes the lizardfolk wonder whether fate is punishing them for some unknown transgression. They grumble, and occasionally a few desert, but most of them bear up with reptilian stoicism.",

He hasn't done so openly, because that would invite retribution from the bullywugs, but he has spoken to a few fellow tribesfolk he trusts. Their response was interested but noncommittal; they intend to take revenge on the bullywugs, but not until the omens are right. Meanwhile, they endure—and stockpile weapons. Borngray has only a rough idea of how many lizardfolk are in the tribe all together, and he hasn't kept close count over how many swords, spears, daggers, shields, and metal-tipped arrows have been turned over to them. The lizardfolk are much better armed at this point than they let on to either the bullywugs or the cultists. When the time comes to move against the bullywugs, the lizardfolk intend for every bullywug throat and belly to be slit open with a new, razor-sharp steel blade.",
										"Like the bullywugs, the lizardfolk's first assumption on seeing strangers is that they are cultists, or allies of the cultists, come to work or parley at the castle. They don't share the bullywugs' arrogance, however, so unless they are attacked, they don't really care who wanders through the camp. Lizardfolk on patrol or standing guard are an exception. They are alert, and they assume everyone is a potential enemy. They won't attack until they know for sure, lest they incur the wrath of {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} or Borngray for killing an ally. As outlying guards, their instructions are to alert the camp when strangers approach, keep the strangers under observation, and await further instructions.",

				"On the following pages, you'll find a number of images designed to serve as story beats in the larger {@i Tyranny of Dragons} campaign. These images were created to define impactful moments in a hypothetical {@i Tyranny of Dragons} tale, one which then could be explored by multiple teams over the course of multiple projects—be they games, fiction, or otherwise. Some elements you'll recognize from the events of the {@i Tyranny of Dragons} adventures, while others were meant to provide inspiration for events parallel stories could detail.",
				"Beyond these, this gallery also includes a number of designs focused on threats integral to the {@i Tyranny of Dragons} campaign. This includes explorations of well-known Forgotten Realms villains, like the Cult of the Dragon and the Red Wizards of Thay. The images herein show just a few avenues explored in updating these foes to the most current edition of the game, along with notes taken from internal concept and story documents. Some present ideas never fully expressed in {@i Tyranny of Dragons}, while others reveal deeper depths to adventure elements hiding whole conceptual icebergs. Certain components central to the adventure also see extensive exploration, like the garb of the Red Wizards, the iconography of the Cult of the Dragon, and—of course—the multiple deadly aspects of one of the campaign's central magic items, the {@item Mask of the Dragon Queen|RoT}.",
				"Several other locations and characters also feature prominently in this collection, many being aspects of the Forgotten Realms or underpinning the wider D&D multiverse that have seen artistic evolutions over the years. The thorough design sketches of chromatic dragons, for example, hint at the depth of ecological detail that's gone into realizing D&D's most iconic monsters—and foes central to the {@i Tyranny of Dragons} plot.",
				"How you choose to use this concept gallery is up to you. Perhaps these details will inspire you, just as they did the original {@i Tyranny of Dragons} designers. Maybe a particular image will resound with you, leading you to make your own addition to the wider campaign. Added insights on the tools and techniques of the adventure's villains can help you make them feel like more vital inhabitants of a wider world, while nuances of dragons and other can creatures aid in bringing these terrors to life. These pages might also be shared with players as you see fit, driving home the impact of the campaign's most climatic moments. Whether this gallery serves as a game aide or inspires your own designs, use it as you please, further detailing the existing adventures or exploring {@i Tyranny of Dragons} stories yet to be told!",
