When the symptoms first strike, the victim takes 5 ({@dice 2d4}) necrotic damage. In addition, a diseased victim regains no hit points or Hit Dice from nonmagical sources, including resting or spending Hit Dice. A victim who finishes a long rest can attempt a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the victim shakes off the disease. Failure deals the character another 5 ({@dice 2d4}) necrotic damage.": "被食尸鬼部件污染的水带有食尸鬼的内脏。喝了这种受污染的水的生物必须在DC12宪法救赎中成功，否则会感染这种疾病。症状在受害者开始长时间休息或接下来变得兴奋时发作，如在战斗中。受害者会遭受严重的痉挛，他们的肠子会发出像两个食尸鬼在打架的声音。当症状首次发作时，受害者会受到5（（%0%））的坏死伤害。此外，患病的受害者不能从非魔法来源恢复命中率或命中率，包括休息或消耗命中率。完成长期休息的受害者可以尝试一个DC12的宪法救赎动作。如果救治成功，受害者就会摆脱疾病的困扰。如果失败，则会造成另一个5({@dice 2d4})的坏死伤害。",
	"A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Medicine}) check can also remove the disease from another creature. Doing so requires the character making the check to care for the sick individual during a long rest. The caregiver gains no benefit from that rest.": "通过DC15智慧（（%0%））检查成功的角色也可以从另一个生物身上去除疾病。这样做需要进行检查的角色在长时间的休息中照顾生病的人。照顾者不会从那次休息中获得任何好处。",
	"The effects of redface are identical to those of {@disease sight rot} (see \"{@book Diseases|DMG|8|Diseases}\" in chapter 8 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}), but it's caused by pollutants in the air rather than contaminated drinking water, making it difficult to avoid.": "红脸病的影响与{@disease sight rot}的影响相同（见{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}第八章的\"{@book Diseases|DMG|8|Diseases}\"），但它是由空气中的污染物而不是受污染的饮用水造成的，因此很难避免。",
	"Xanthoria's research into lichdom and her creation of a living phylactery led to the emergence of the plague spreading across the Sword Coast. Any beast or humanoid that comes within 10 feet of a creature infected by the saprophytic plague must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or become infected as well. On a successful save, a creature is immune to the plague for 24 hours, and any creature that is immune to disease succeeds on the save automatically.": "Xanthoria对Lichdom的研究和她对活体法器的创造导致了瘟疫的出现，并在整个剑海岸蔓延。任何在10英尺范围内的野兽或类人都必须在DC20宪法救赎中成功，否则也会被感染。拯救成功后，生物会在24小时内对瘟疫免疫，任何对疾病免疫的生物都会自动拯救成功。",

	"A creature infected by the saprophytic plague for at least 24 hours behaves like a zombie and seems barely aware of its surroundings, as fungal growths sprout from its head, body, and limbs. It feels an overriding urge to be around groups of uninfected creatures so that it can spread the contagion. This is the time when infected humanoids begin speaking the word \"Xanthoria\" over and over, with no understanding of what the word means. This behavior is the result of a mycelial network of spores that forms a tenuous connection between Xanthoria and humanoids that become infected by the plague.": "被滋生性瘟疫感染至少24小时的生物表现得像个僵尸，似乎几乎意识不到周围的环境，因为真菌从它的头部、身体和四肢长出来了。它感到有一种压倒性的冲动，想在未受感染的生物群体周围，以便传播传染病。这时，被感染的人类开始反复说 \"Xanthoria \"这个词，而不理解这个词的含义。这种行为是由孢子的菌丝网络造成的，它在桑托利亚和被瘟疫感染的人类之间形成了一种脆弱的联系。",

	"Spider eggs implanted in a host hatch in {@dice 2d12} hours, killing the host as the baby spiders chew their way out. This infestation functions like a disease.

	"A creature that contracts the disease of super-tetanus is wracked with pain as its heart races and its muscles spasm hard enough to break its bones.

	"The plague's symptoms include buboes, fatigue, splotchy rashes, sweats, and shaking, particularly facial tremors. Locals liken these twitches to the sniffing of rats. Sufferers often have scraps of leather placed in their mouths to prevent their teeth from clattering, though they inevitably gnaw through these scraps.": "鼠疫的症状包括气泡、疲劳、斑点状皮疹、出汗和颤抖，特别是面部颤抖。当地人将这些抽搐比作老鼠的嗅觉。患病者常常在嘴里放上皮屑，以防止牙齿咬碎，尽管他们不可避免地咬碎了这些皮屑。",
	"At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature gains 1 level of {@condition exhaustion}. On a successful save, the creature's {@condition exhaustion} level decreases by 1. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature's level of {@condition exhaustion} below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.": "在每次长休结束时，被感染的生物必须做一个DC 10的宪法救赎动作。拯救失败时，该生物获得1级的（%0%）。如果救治成功，该生物的（%1%）等级会降低1级。如果救治成功后，受感染生物的（%2%）等级降低到1级以下，该生物就会从疾病中恢复过来。",
