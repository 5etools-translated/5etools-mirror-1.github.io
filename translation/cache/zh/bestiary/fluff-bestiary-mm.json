They spy on malign elemental creatures and then either take the fight to those creatures or report back to the Wind Dukes.": "在为Aaqa的风之公爵服务时，Aarakocra在各星球上寻找元素邪恶的神庙。他们监视着邪恶的元素生物，然后要么与这些生物战斗，要么向风公爵报告。",
	"On the Material Plane, aarakocra create aeries atop the highest mountains, especially peaks near portals to the Elemental Plane of Air. From such heights, aarakocra watch for signs of elemental incursions, as well as for nascent threats to their home plane. Aarakocra prefer to live their lives like the wind-unburdened and ever moving-yet they watch over a region for years if that's what it takes to guard against the incursions of Elemental Evil.": "在物质界，阿拉科克拉在最高的山峰上建立了一个空洞，特别是在通往空气元素界的门户附近的山峰。在这样的高度上，阿拉科克拉人观察着元素入侵的迹象，以及对他们的母体世界的新生威胁。Aarakocra更喜欢像风一样生活--没有负担和不断移动--但他们会监视一个地区很多年，如果这是为了防止元素邪恶的入侵。",

In their eyes, a creature should use what is necessary and then cast what is left on the wind for others to use.": "Aarakocra没有政治边界或财产所有权的概念，宝石、黄金和其他珍贵材料的价值对Aarakocra来说意义不大。在他们眼里，一个生物应该使用必要的东西，然后把剩下的东西扔到风中供别人使用。",

A creature known as the Queen of Chaos arose and initiated an interplanar war against vaati rule. To combat the threat, seven vaati heroes combined their powers to create the mighty {@i Rod of Law}. In a battle against the queen's greatest general, Mishka the Wolf Spider, a vaati killed Mishka by thrusting the rod into him like a spear.

	"Five aarakocra within 30 feet of each other can magically summon an air elemental. Each of the five must use its action and movement on three consecutive turns to perform an aerial dance and must maintain concentration while doing so (as if concentrating on a spell). When all five have finished their third turn of the dance, the elemental appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of them. It is friendly toward them and obeys their spoken commands. It remains for 1 hour, until it or all its summoners die, or until any of its summoners dismisses it as a bonus action. A summoner can't perform the dance again until it finishes a short rest.

Aboleths have never forgotten.": "在诸神到来之前，阿波勒斯潜伏在原始海洋和地下湖泊中。他们用自己的思想伸出手来，控制了凡人界新兴的生命形式，使这些生物成为他们的奴隶。他们的统治地位使他们像神一样。然后，真正的神出现了，粉碎了亚博莱思的帝国，并释放了他们的奴隶。Aboleths从未忘记。",

	" Aboleths dwell in watery environments, including ocean abysses, deep lakes, and the Elemental Plane of Water. In these domains and the lands that adjoin them, aboleths are like gods, demanding worship and obedience from their subjects. When they consume other creatures, aboleths add the knowledge and experiences of their prey to their eternal memories. Aboleths use their telepathic powers to read the minds of creatures and know their desires. An aboleth uses this knowledge to gain a creature's loyalty, promising to fulfill such wants in exchange for obedience. Within its lair, the aboleth can further use its powers to override senses, granting creatures, such as its followers, the illusion of promised rewards.": " Aboleths居住在水的环境中，包括海洋深渊、深湖和水元素界。在这些领域和与之相邻的土地上，阿波勒斯就像神一样，要求他们的臣民进行崇拜和顺从。当他们吞噬其他生物时，boleths将猎物的知识和经验加入他们永恒的记忆。Aboleths使用他们的心灵感应能力来阅读生物的思想，并了解他们的欲望。Aboleth利用这些知识来获得生物的忠诚，承诺满足这些欲望以换取服从。在它的巢穴中，阿波勒斯可以进一步使用它的力量来超越感官，给予生物，比如它的追随者，承诺的奖励的幻觉。",
	"The aboleths' fall from power is written in stark clarity on their flawless memories, for aboleths never truly die.

	"Even as long-lived as they are, all dragons must eventually die. This thought doesn't sit well with many dragons, some of which allow themselves to be transformed by necromantic energy and ancient rituals into powerful undead dracoliches. Only the most narcissistic dragons choose this path, knowing that by doing so, they sever all ties to their kin and the dragon gods.": "即使像他们一样长寿，所有的龙最终都必须死亡。这种想法对许多龙来说并不合适，其中一些龙允许自己被死灵能量和古老的仪式转化为强大的不死龙人。只有最自恋的龙才会选择这条道路，因为他们知道这样做会切断与他们的亲属和龙神的所有联系。",
	"A dracolich retains its shape and size upon transforming, its skin and scales drawing tight to its bones or sloughing away to leave a skeletal form behind. Its eyes appear as glowing points of light floating in shadowy sockets, hinting at the malevolence of its undead mind.": "德拉科维奇在变身后会保持其形状和大小，它的皮肤和鳞片会紧紧地贴在骨头上，或者剥落下来，留下一个骨架形状。它的眼睛就像漂浮在阴暗的眼眶中的发光点，暗示着它不死之心的恶毒。",
	"Though many dragons pursue vain goals of destruction and dominance, dracoliches are more nefarious than the most evil dragons, driven to rule over all. A dracolich is a fiendishly intelligent tyrant that crafts complex webs of foul schemes, attracting servants motivated by greed and a lust for power. Acting from the shadows and actively plotting to keep its existence a secret, a dracolich is a cunning and challenging foe.": "虽然许多龙都追求破坏和统治的虚荣目标，但龙族比最邪恶的龙更邪恶，他们被驱使着去统治所有的人。德拉科利奇是一个聪明绝顶的暴君，它制定了复杂的邪恶计划网，吸引了以贪婪和权力欲望为动机的仆人。德拉科里奇在阴影中行动，并积极策划保持其存在的秘密，是一个狡猾而富有挑战性的敌人。",
	"Creating a dracolich requires the cooperation of the dragon and a group of mages or cultists that can perform the proper ritual. During the ritual, the dragon consumes a toxic brew that slays it instantly. The attendant spellcasters then ensnare its spirit and transfer it to a special gemstone that functions like a lich's phylactery. As the dragon's flesh rots away, the spirit inside the gem returns to animate the dragon's bones.": "创造一个龙人需要龙和一群能够进行适当仪式的法师或邪教徒的合作。在仪式中，龙会喝下一种有毒的饮料，瞬间将其杀死。然后，随行的法术师将其灵魂捕获，并将其转移到一块特殊的宝石上，该宝石的功能类似于巫师的法器。当龙的肉体腐烂时，宝石中的灵魂就会回到龙的骨头上，使其充满活力。",
	"If a dracolich's physical form is ever destroyed, its spirit returns to the gem as long as the two are on the same plane. If the gem comes into contact with another dragon's corpse, the dracolich's spirit can take possession of that corpse to become a new dracolich. If the dracolich's spirit gem is taken to another plane, the dracolich's spirit has nowhere to go when its undead body is destroyed and simply passes into the afterlife.": "如果龙的身体形态被摧毁，只要两者在同一平面上，它的精神就会回到宝石中。如果宝石接触到另一个龙的尸体，龙的精神可以占有该尸体，成为一个新的龙。如果龙族的精神宝石被带到另一个位面，当龙族的不死之身被摧毁时，龙族的精神就无处可去，只能进入来世。",
	"Only an ancient or adult true dragon can be transformed into a dracolich. Younger dragons that attempt to undergo the transformation die, as do other creatures that aren't true dragons but possess the dragon type, such as pseudodragons and wyverns. A shadow dragon can't be transformed into a dracolich, for it has already lost too much of its physical form.": "只有古老或成年的真龙才能转化为龙人。试图变身的年轻龙会死亡，其他不是真龙但拥有龙型的生物也会死亡，比如假龙和狼人。影龙不能被转化为龙族，因为它已经失去了太多的身体形态。",
	"When a dragon becomes a dracolich, it retains its statistics except as described below. The dragon loses any trait, such as Amphibious, that assumes a living physiology. The dracolich might retain or lose any or all of its lair actions or inherit new ones, as the DM sees fit.": "当龙变成龙族时，除了以下描述外，它保留了它的统计数据。龙失去了任何特质，比如两栖的特质，这些特质具有活体的生理特征。龙可能会保留或失去它的任何或所有巢穴行动，或继承新的行动，这由DM决定。",

Herbivorous dinosaurs are less aggressive, but they might attack to defend their young, or if startled or harassed.": "恐龙，或称巨兽，是世界上最古老的爬行动物之一。掠食性恐龙是野蛮的、领土性的猎手。食草恐龙的攻击性较弱，但它们可能会为了保护自己的孩子，或在受到惊吓或骚扰时进行攻击。",
	"Dinosaurs come in many sizes and shapes. Larger varieties often have drab coloration, while smaller dinosaurs have colorful markings akin to birds. Dinosaurs roam rugged and isolated areas that humanoids seldom visit, including remote mountain valleys, inaccessible plateaus, tropical islands, and deep fens.": "恐龙有许多大小和形状。较大的品种通常有单调的颜色，而较小的恐龙则有类似鸟类的彩色斑纹。恐龙游荡在人类很少去的崎岖和孤立的地区，包括偏远的山沟、难以到达的高原、热带岛屿和深海沼泽。",
	"An androsphinx bears the head of a humanoid male on its lion's body. Outwardly gruff and downcast, it often begins conversations with insults or negative observations.

Those who pass its tests may be rewarded with a heroes' feast.": "雄鼻兽考验祈求者的勇气和胆量，不仅强迫他们完成任务，而且还发出可怕的吼声，使附近的生物感到恐惧和震耳欲聋，回响数英里。那些通过测试的人可能会得到一个英雄盛宴的奖励。",

Sometimes a sphinx must be summoned from such an extradimensional space, with supplicants calling it from its empty lair. Only those the sphinx deems worthy gain admittance to its realm.": " 凡人遇到狮身人面像最常见的是在古墓和废墟中，但有些狮身人面像可以进入星外的领域。与狮身人面像的对话开始于翻滚的石墙之间，可能会突然转移到一个陌生的地方，比如一个真人大小的游戏盘或一个必须在呼啸的风暴中攀登的令人生畏的悬崖。有时，狮身人面像必须从这样一个超维空间被召唤出来，祈求者从它的空巢中召唤它。只有那些斯芬克斯认为有价值的人才能进入它的领域。",

This crafting process limits the growth of the azer population and is the primary reason that these creatures remain rare.": " 阿兹尔人不会繁殖。他们每个人都是由另一个阿泽尔用青铜制作的，并被灌注了制作者的一部分内在火焰。每个阿兹尔都被雕刻出独特的特征。这种制作过程限制了阿兹尔人口的增长，也是这些生物保持稀有的主要原因。",
	"Azers dwell in a kingdom on the border between the Elemental Plane of Earth and the Elemental Plane of Fire-a range of mountains and volcanoes whose spires rise as a series of fortresses. Beneath mountain peaks, under volcanic calderas, and amid rivers of magma, azers extract gleaming metals and glittering gems from the earth. Squads of azer patrol the passes and tunnels of their realm, fending off the salamander raiders whose efreet masters order strikes against the azer kingdom.": "阿泽尔人居住在土元素界和火元素界交界处的一个王国--一个由山脉和火山组成的范围，其尖顶像一系列的堡垒一样耸立。在山峰下，在火山口下，在岩浆河中，阿兹尔人从地球上提取闪亮的金属和闪亮的宝石。一队队的阿兹尔人在他们的王国的通道和隧道里巡逻，抵御蝾螈的袭击者，他们的埃弗里特主人命令对阿兹尔王国进行袭击。",
	"Long ago, the efreet and the azers were allies. Azers helped create the City of Brass, forging that home of the efreet into one of the most wondrous places in creation. When the azers had finished their work, the efreet betrayed them, making a failed attempt to enslave the azers so as to protect the secrets of the city. Despite occasional raids and skirmishes, however, the two sides have so far refrained from all-out conflict. The azers believe that only the threat of them revealing the hidden ways into the City of Brass keeps the efreet in check.": "很久以前，伊弗里特人和阿泽尔人是盟友。阿泽尔人帮助创建了黄铜城，将伊夫里特人的家园锻造成了造物中最奇妙的地方之一。当阿兹尔人完成他们的工作后，伊夫里特人背叛了他们，试图奴役阿兹尔人以保护城市的秘密，但没有成功。尽管偶尔会有突袭和小规模的冲突，但双方至今都没有发生全面的冲突。阿兹尔人认为，只有他们透露进入黄铜之城的隐秘途径的威胁才能使伊夫里特人受到控制。",
	"Azers are masterful artisans, and create beautiful works from the gems and precious metals found in their volcanic habitat. They rate the value of such treasures above all other things, sometimes dispatching parties across the planes to seek out rare metals and gemstones.": "阿泽尔人是高超的工匠，他们用在火山栖息地发现的宝石和贵重金属创造出美丽的作品。他们把这种宝物的价值看得高于一切，有时会派人到各星球去寻找稀有金属和宝石。",
	"When azers are called by magic to the Material Plane, it is typically to help forge an elaborate magic item or work of art, for it is said that their skill in such craft knows no equal.": "当阿兹尔被魔法召唤到物质世界时，通常是为了帮助锻造一个精致的魔法物品或艺术品，因为据说他们在这种工艺方面的技能是无人能及的。",
	"An azer doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.": "Azer不需要食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"Figures of ancient and terrible evil, balors rule as generals over demonic armies, yearning to seize power while destroying any creatures that oppose them.": "Balors是古老而可怕的邪恶人物，他们作为将军统治着恶魔的军队，渴望夺取权力，同时摧毁任何反对他们的生物。",
	"Wielding a flaming whip and a longsword that channels the power of the storm, a balor's battle prowess is fueled by hatred and rage. It channels this demonic fury in its death throes, falling within a blast of fire that can destroy even the hardiest foes.": "挥舞着火焰鞭子和一把长剑，引导着风暴的力量，巴洛尔的战斗力是由仇恨和愤怒推动的。它在死亡的时候会引导这种恶魔般的愤怒，在火焰的爆炸中倒下，甚至可以摧毁最顽强的敌人。",
	"Bandits rove in gangs and are sometimes led by thugs, veterans, or spellcasters. Not all bandits are evil. Oppression, drought, disease, or famine can often drive otherwise honest folk to a life of banditry.": "土匪以帮派形式游荡，有时由暴徒、老兵或施法者领导。并非所有土匪都是邪恶的。压迫、干旱、疾病或饥荒往往会驱使其他诚实的人过上强盗的生活。",
	"Pirates are bandits of the high seas. They might be freebooters interested only in treasure and murder, or they might be privateers sanctioned by the crown to attack and plunder an enemy nation's vessels.": "海盗是公海上的匪徒。他们可能是只对财宝和谋杀感兴趣的自由盗贼，也可能是由王室批准的袭击和掠夺敌人国家船只的私掠者。",
	"It takes a strong personality, ruthless cunning, and a silver tongue to keep a gang of bandits in line. The bandit captain has these qualities in spades.": "要让一帮强盗保持一致，需要强大的个性、无情的狡猾和银色的舌头。土匪头子就具备这些素质。",
	"In addition to managing a crew of selfish malcontents, the pirate captain is a variation of the bandit captain, with a ship to protect and command. To keep the crew in line, the captain must mete out rewards and punishment on a regular basis.": "除了管理一帮自私自利的恶棍之外，海盗船长也是强盗船长的变种，要保护和指挥一艘船。为了让船员们保持一致，船长必须定期进行奖惩。",
	"More than treasure, a bandit captain or pirate captain craves infamy. A prisoner who appeals to the captain's vanity or ego is more likely to be treated fairly than a prisoner who does not or claims not to know anything of the captain's colorful reputation.": "比起财宝，强盗船长或海盗船长更渴望声名狼藉。一个迎合船长的虚荣心或自尊心的囚犯比一个不知道或声称不知道船长的多彩名声的囚犯更有可能得到公平对待。",
	"When night falls, unlucky travelers hear the faint cries of the forlorn dead. This woeful spirit is a banshee, a spiteful creature formed from the spirit of a female elf. Banshees appear as luminous, wispy forms that vaguely recall their mortal features. A banshee's face is wreathed in a wild tangle of hair, its body clad in wispy rags that flutter and stream around it.": "当夜幕降临时，倒霉的旅行者会听到绝望的死者的微弱哭声。这种悲惨的灵魂是女妖，一种由女性精灵的灵魂形成的可憎的生物。女妖以发光的、飘忽不定的形式出现，依稀可以看出其凡人的特征。女妖的脸被疯狂的头发缠绕着，它的身体披着飘忽不定的破布，在它周围飘动和流动。",
	"Banshees are the undead remnants of elves who, blessed with great beauty, failed to use their gift to bring joy to the world. Instead, they used their beauty to corrupt and control others. Elves afflicted by the banshee's curse experience no gladness, feeling only distress in the presence of the living. As the curse takes its toll, their minds and bodies decay, until death completes their transformation into undead monsters.": "女妖是精灵的不死残余，她们被赋予了巨大的美貌，却没有利用她们的天赋为世界带来欢乐。相反，他们利用自己的美貌来腐蚀和控制他人。遭受女妖诅咒的精灵们不会体验到快乐，在活人面前只感到痛苦。随着诅咒造成的损失，他们的思想和身体都会腐烂，直到死亡使他们完成了向不死怪物的转变。",
	"A banshee becomes forever bound to the place of its demise, unable to venture more than five miles from there. It is forced to relive every moment of its life with perfect recall, yet always refuses to accept responsibility for its doom.": "女妖将永远被束缚在其死亡的地方，无法冒险离开那里超过五英里。它被迫以完美的回忆重温其生命中的每一刻，但始终拒绝为自己的死亡负责。",
	"The vanity that inspired the banshee's cursed creation persists in undeath. These creatures covet beautiful objects: fine jewelery, paintings, statues, and other objects of art. At the same time, a banshee abhors any mirrored surface, for it can't bear to see the horror of its own existence. A single glimpse of itself is enough to send a banshee into a rage.": "激发女妖受诅咒的创作的虚荣心在未死时依然存在。这些生物觊觎美丽的物品：精美的珠宝、绘画、雕像和其他艺术物品。同时，女妖厌恶任何镜面，因为它不能忍受看到自己存在的恐怖。只要看到自己的一瞥，就足以让女妖陷入愤怒。",
	"A banshee doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "女妖不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"Creatures of unbridled greed and desire, barbed devils act as guards to the more powerful denizens of the Nine Hells and their vaults. Resembling a tall humanoid covered in sharp barbs, spines, and hooks, a barbed devil has gleaming eyes that are ever watchful for objects and creatures it might claim for itself. These fiends welcome any chance to fight when victory promises reward.": "带刺魔鬼是一种贪婪和欲望无度的生物，它是九层地狱中更强大的居民及其金库的守卫。带刺魔鬼像一个高大的人形生物，身上长满了锋利的倒钩、刺和钩子，它有一双闪闪发光的眼睛，时刻注意着它可能为自己索取的物品和生物。当胜利带来回报时，这些恶魔欢迎任何战斗的机会。",
	"Barbed devils are known for an alertness that makes them difficult to surprise, and they attend to their duties without boredom or distraction. They use their sharp claws as weapons or hurl balls of flame at foes that try to flee them.": "带刺魔鬼以警觉性高而著称，这使得他们难以出其不意，他们不厌其烦地履行自己的职责，也不分心。它们用锋利的爪子作为武器，或者向试图逃离它们的敌人投掷火焰球。",
	"The barlgura represents the savagery and brutality of the Abyss. Barlguras gather in packs to take down tougher foes, keep gruesome trophies from their victories, and decorate their territory with such objects.": "巴尔古拉代表着深渊的野蛮和残暴。巴尔古拉成群结队，打倒更强悍的敌人，保留他们胜利后的可怕战利品，并用这些物品装饰他们的领土。",
	"A barlgura looks like a hulking orangutan with a gruesome, drooping visage and tusks jutting from its jaw. Standing just under 8 feet tall, it has broad shoulders and weighs 650 pounds. It moves apishly along the ground, but it climbs with great speed and agility.": "巴尔古拉看起来像一只笨重的猩猩，有一个可怕的、下垂的面孔，下颚有獠牙突出。它身高不到8英尺，肩部宽阔，体重达650磅。它沿着地面猿猴般地移动，但它以极快的速度和敏捷性爬行。",
	"Travelers sometimes find objects that look like pieces of remarkably lifelike stone carvings of wildlife. Missing parts appear to have been bitten off. Seasoned explorers regard such relics as warnings, knowing that the basilisk that created them is likely to be nearby.": "旅行者有时会发现一些物体，它们看起来就像栩栩如生的野生动物石雕的碎片。缺少的部分似乎是被咬掉的。经验丰富的探险家将这些遗物视为警告，因为他们知道创造它们的玄武岩可能就在附近。",
	"Basilisks thrive in arid, temperate, or tropical climates. They lair in caves or other sheltered sites. Most often, basilisks are encountered underground.": "Basilisks在干旱、温带或热带气候下生长。它们在山洞或其他有遮挡的地方筑巢。最常见的情况是，巴西利亚人在地下遇到。",
	"A basilisk born and raised in captivity can be domesticated and trained. Such a trained basilisk knows how to avoid meeting the eyes of those its master wishes to protect from its gaze, but it makes a daunting guardian beast. Because of this use, basilisk eggs are highly prized.": "在人工饲养下出生和长大的巴斯里斯克可以被驯化和训练。这样的训练有素的巴斯里斯克知道如何避免与它的主人希望保护的人对视，但它是一个令人生畏的守护神兽。由于这种用途，巴斯里斯克的蛋被高度珍视。",
	"Basilisks are ponderous for hunting creatures, but they needn't chase prey. Meeting a basilisk's supernatural gaze can be enough to affect a rapid transformation, transforming a victim into porous stone. Basilisks, with their strong jaws, are able to consume the stone. The stone returns to organic form in the basilisk's gullet.": "玄武岩对于狩猎生物来说是深思熟虑的，但它们不需要追赶猎物。遇到巴斯里斯克超自然的目光，就足以影响它的快速转变，将受害者变成多孔的石头。玄武岩，以其强壮的下颚，能够吞噬石头。石头在巴斯里斯克的口中恢复到有机形态。",
	"Some alchemists are said to know how to process the basilisk's gullet and the fluids contained within. Properly handled, the gullet produces an oil that can return {@condition petrified} creatures to flesh and life. Unfortunately for such a victim, any parts lost in stone form remain absent if the creature revives. Revivification using the oil is impossible if a vital part of the {@condition petrified} creature, such as its head, is detached.": "据说有些炼金术士知道如何处理巴斯里斯克的胃和其中的液体。如果处理得当，胃口会产生一种油，可以让生物恢复肉体和生命（%0%）。不幸的是，对于这样的受害者来说，如果该生物复活，在石头形态下失去的任何部分仍然不存在。如果(1%)的生物的重要部分，例如它的头，脱离了，那么使用这种油就不可能复活了。",
	"Bearded devils serve archdevils as shock troops, fighting shoulder-to-shoulder and reveling in the glory of battle. They respond with violence to any slight, real or imagined, gorging themselves on violence as their infernal saw-toothed glaives carve a path through their foes.": "有胡子的魔鬼为大魔鬼服务，作为突击队，肩并肩地战斗，陶醉于战斗的荣耀。他们用暴力来回应任何轻视，不管是真实的还是想象的，当他们的地狱锯齿状玻璃刀在他们的敌人身上开出一条路时，他们就会大吃大喝起来。",
	"A bearded devil is humanoid in form, with pointed ears, scaly skin, a long tail, and claws that clearly show its fiendish nature. These devils take their names from the snakelike growths that adorn their chins, which they use to lash and poison enemies, weakening them with their virulent venom.": "胡子魔鬼是人形的，有尖尖的耳朵，有鳞片的皮肤，有长长的尾巴，还有清楚地显示其恶魔本性的爪子。这些魔鬼的名字来自于他们下巴上长出的像蛇一样的东西，他们用这些东西来鞭打和毒害敌人，用毒液削弱他们的力量。",
	"The serpentine behir crawls along floors and clambers up walls to reach its prey. Its lightning breath can incinerate most creatures, even as more powerful foes are constricted in its coils and eaten alive.": "蛇形的贝希尔沿着地板爬行，并爬上墙壁以接近它的猎物。它的闪电气息可以焚烧大多数生物，即使是更强大的敌人也会被它的线圈束缚住并被活活吃掉。",
	"A behir's monstrous form resembles a combination of centipede and crocodile. Its scaled hide ranges from ultramarine to deep blue in color, fading to pale blue on its underside.": "贝希尔的畸形形态类似于蜈蚣和鳄鱼的组合。它的鳞片皮的颜色从群青色到深蓝色不等，在它的底部渐渐变成淡蓝色。",
	"Behirs lair in places inaccessible to other creatures, favoring locations where would-be intruders must make a harrowing climb to reach them. Deep pits, high caves in cliff walls, and caverns reached only by narrow, twisting tunnels are prime sites for a behir ambush. A behir's dozen legs allow it to scramble through its lair site with ease. When not climbing, it moves even faster by folding its legs beside its body and slithering like a snake.": "贝希尔在其他生物无法进入的地方筑巢，喜欢那些可能的入侵者必须经过艰苦的攀爬才能到达的地方。深坑、崖壁上的高洞以及只能通过狭窄、曲折的隧道到达的洞穴，都是贝希尔伏击的主要地点。一个behir的十几条腿使它能够轻松地爬过它的巢穴地点。不爬的时候，它通过把腿折叠在身体旁边，像蛇一样滑行，移动得更快。",
	"Behirs swallow their prey whole, after which they enter a period of dormancy while they digest. While dormant, a behir chooses a hiding place where intruders in its lair might overlook it.": "猎物被整个吞下，之后在消化过程中进入休眠期。在休眠期间，贝希尔会选择一个隐藏的地方，在那里它的巢穴的入侵者可能会忽略它。",
	"In times long forgotten, giants and dragons engaged in seemingly endless war. Storm giants created the first behirs as weapons against the dragons, and behirs retain a natural hatred for dragonkind.": "在被遗忘已久的时代，巨人和巨龙进行着似乎无休止的战争。风暴巨人创造了第一批贝希尔，作为对抗龙的武器，而贝希尔对龙族保持着天然的仇恨。",
	"A behir never makes its lair in an area it knows to be inhabited by a dragon. If a dragon attempts to establish a lair within a few dozen miles of a behir's lair, the behir is compelled to kill the dragon or drive it off. Only if the dragon proves too powerful to fight does a behir back down, seeking out a new lair site a great distance away.": "贝里尔从不在它知道有龙居住的地方筑巢。如果有龙试图在贝里尔巢穴的几十英里范围内建立巢穴，贝里尔会被迫杀死龙或将其赶走。只有当龙被证明过于强大而无法战斗时，贝希尔才会退缩，在很远的地方寻找一个新的巢穴地点。",
	"One glance at a beholder is enough to assess its foul and otherworldly nature. Aggressive, hateful, and greedy, these aberrations dismiss all other creatures as lesser beings, toying with them or destroying them as they choose.": "只要看一眼，就足以评估其肮脏和异世界的性质。侵略性、憎恨和贪婪，这些反常者将所有其他生物视为低等生物，随意玩弄或摧毁它们。",
	"A beholder's spheroid body levitates at all times, and its great bulging eye sits above a wide, toothy maw, while the smaller eyestalks that crown its body twist and turn to keep its foes in sight. When a beholder sleeps, it closes its central eye but leaves its smaller eyes open and alert.": "看守者的球状身体随时都会悬浮起来，它巨大的隆起的眼睛坐落在宽大的、有齿的大嘴之上，而它身体上的小眼柄则扭曲和转动，以保持它的敌人在视线内。当看守者睡觉时，它会闭上它的中心眼，但让它的小眼睛睁开并保持警惕。",
	"Enemies abound, or so every beholder believes. Beholders are convinced that other creatures resent them for their brilliance and magical power, even as they dismiss those lesser creatures as crude and disgusting. Beholders always suspect others of plotting against them, even when no other creatures are around.": "敌人比比皆是，或者说每个看客都这么认为。看守者确信其他生物因为他们的光辉和魔力而憎恨他们，即使他们把那些较小的生物视为粗鲁和恶心。看待者总是怀疑其他人在密谋对付他们，即使周围没有其他生物。",
	"The disdain a beholder has for other creatures extends to other beholders. Each beholder believes its form to be an ideal, and that any deviation from that form is a flaw in the racial purity of its kind. Beholders vary greatly in their physical forms, making conflict between them inevitable. Some beholders are protected by overlapping chitinous plates. Some have smooth hides. Some have eyestalks that writhe like tentacles, while others' stalks bear crustacean-like joints. Even slight differences of coloration in hide can turn two beholders into lifelong enemies.": "一个看守者对其他生物的蔑视也延伸到其他看守者。每个人都认为自己的形态是一种理想，任何偏离这种形态的行为都是对其种族纯洁性的一种缺陷。看守者的身体形态差异很大，因此他们之间的冲突不可避免。有些变形金刚被重叠的几丁质板所保护。有些则有光滑的皮毛。有些人的眼柄像触角一样蠕动，而另一些人的眼柄则有甲壳类动物的关节。即使是皮肤颜色上的细微差别，也能使两个人变成终生的敌人。",
	"Some beholders manage to channel their xenophobic tendencies into a terrible despotism. Rather than live in isolation, the aptly named eye tyrants enslave those other creatures, founding and controlling vast empires. An eye tyrant sometimes carves out a domain within or under a major city, commanding networks of agents that operate on their master's behalf.": "一些眼球持有者设法将他们的排外倾向转化为可怕的专制主义。这些被恰当地命名为眼球暴君的人并没有与世隔绝，而是奴役那些其他生物，建立并控制庞大的帝国。一个眼球暴君有时会在一个主要城市内或地下开辟出一个领域，指挥着代表其主人的代理人网络。",
	"Because they refuse to share territory with others, most beholders withdraw to frigid hills, abandoned ruins, and deep caverns to scheme. A beholder's lair is carved out by its disintegration eye ray, emphasizing vertical passages connecting chambers stacked on top of each other. Such an environment allows a beholder to move freely, even as it prevents intruders from easily creeping about. When intruders do break in, the height of its open ceilings allows a beholder to float up and harry foes on the floor.": "因为他们拒绝与他人分享领地，所以大多数beholder都撤回到寒冷的山丘、废弃的废墟和深邃的洞穴中进行谋划。一个Beholder的巢穴是由它的分解眼射线雕刻出来的，强调垂直通道，连接堆叠在一起的房间。这样的环境允许看守者自由移动，即使它阻止了入侵者轻易地爬行。当入侵者真的闯入时，其开放的天花板的高度允许看守者漂浮起来，在地板上骚扰敌人。",
	"As alien as their creator, the rooms in a beholder's lair reflect the creature's arrogance. It festoons its chambers with trophies from the battles it has won, including {@condition petrified} adventurers standing frozen in their horrified final moments, pieces of other beholders, and magic items wrested from powerful foes. A beholder judges its own worth by its acquisitions, and it never willingly parts with its treasures.": "就像它们的创造者一样，持灵者的巢穴中的房间反映了这种生物的傲慢。它用它赢得的战利品来装饰它的房间，包括{@condition petrified}站在他们惊恐的最后时刻的冒险者，其他持灵者的碎片，以及从强大的敌人手中夺取的魔法物品。一个持有者以其获得的东西来判断自己的价值，它从不愿意与它的宝物分开。",
	"A beholder's central lair is typically a large, spacious cavern with high ceilings, where it can attack without fear of closing to melee range. A beholder encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 14 (11,500 XP).": "看守者的中心巢穴通常是一个宽敞的大洞穴，天花板很高，在那里它可以毫无顾忌地进行攻击，而不用担心接近近战范围。在巢穴中遇到的Beholder的挑战等级为14（11,500XP）。",
	"Hailing from uncivilized lands, unpredictable berserkers come together in war parties and seek conflict wherever they can find it.": "来自未开化的土地，不可预知的狂暴者聚集在一起组成战队，在他们能找到的地方寻求冲突。",
	"The most evil-tempered and vile of the chromatic dragons, black dragons collect the wreckage and treasures of fallen peoples. These dragons loathe seeing the weak prosper and revel in the collapse of humanoid kingdoms. They make their homes in fetid swamps and crumbling ruins where kingdoms once stood.": "黑龙是色龙中脾气最坏、最卑鄙的，它收集堕落民族的残骸和财物。这些龙厌恶看到弱者的繁荣，并为人形王国的崩溃而感到高兴。它们把自己的家安在潮湿的沼泽地和王国曾经存在的摇摇欲坠的废墟上。",
	"With deep-socketed eyes and broad nasal openings, a black dragon's face resembles a skull. Its curving, segmented horns are bone-colored near the base and darken to dead black at the tips. As a black dragon ages, the flesh around its horns and cheekbones deteriorates as though eaten by acid, leaving thin layers of hide that enhance its skeletal appearance. A black dragon's head is marked by spikes and horns. Its tongue is flat with a forked tip, drooling slime whose acidic scent adds to the dragon's reek of rotting vegetation and foul water.": "黑龙有深陷的眼睛和宽大的鼻孔，它的脸就像一个头骨。它弯曲的、分段式的角在靠近底部时是骨色的，在角的顶端会变暗，变成死黑色。随着黑龙的衰老，它的角和颧骨周围的肉会像被酸吃掉一样变质，留下薄薄的皮层，增强其骨骼的外观。黑龙的头部有尖刺和角的标志。它的舌头是平的，顶端分叉，流着粘液，其酸性气味使龙的腐烂植物和臭水的气味更加浓郁。",
	"When it hatches, a black dragon has glossy black scale. As it ages, its scales become thicker and duller, helping it blend in to the marshes and blasted ruins that are its home.": "当黑龙孵化时，它有光亮的黑色鳞片。随着年龄的增长，它的鳞片变得更厚、更暗淡，帮助它融入沼泽地和被炸毁的废墟中，这是它的家。",
	"All chromatic dragons are evil, but black dragons stand apart for their sadistic nature. A black dragon lives to watch its prey beg for mercy, and will often offer the illusion of respite or escape before finishing off its enemies.": "所有的色龙都是邪恶的，但黑龙因其虐待狂的本性而与众不同。黑龙的生活就是看着它的猎物乞求怜悯，并经常在结束它的敌人之前提供一个喘息或逃跑的假象。",
	"A black dragon strikes at its weakest enemies first, ensuring a quick and brutal victory, which bolsters its ego as it terrifies its remaining foes. On the verge of defeat, a black dragon does anything it can to save itself, but it accepts death before allowing any other creature to claim mastery over it.": "黑龙首先攻击它最弱小的敌人，确保快速和残酷的胜利，这使它的自尊心得到加强，因为它使剩下的敌人感到害怕。在失败的边缘，黑龙会尽其所能拯救自己，但在允许任何其他生物对其进行控制之前，它接受了死亡。",
	"Black dragons hate and fear other dragons. They spy on draconic rivals from afar, looking for opportunities to slay weaker dragons and avoid stronger ones. If a stronger dragon threatens it, a black dragon abandons its lair and seeks out new territory.": "黑龙讨厌并害怕其他龙。它们从远处窥探龙族的对手，寻找机会杀死较弱的龙，避开较强的龙。如果有更强的龙威胁到它，黑龙就会放弃它的巢穴，寻找新的领地。",
	"Evil lizardfolk venerate and serve black dragons, raiding humanoid settlements for treasure and food to give as tribute and building crude draconic effigies along the borders of their dragon master's domain.": "邪恶的蜥蜴人崇敬并服务于黑龙，他们掠夺人形定居点的财宝和食物作为贡品，并沿着龙族主人的领地边界建造粗陋的龙族雕像。",
	"A black dragon's malevolent influence might also cause the spontaneous creation of evil shambling mounds that seek out and slay good creatures approaching the dragon's lair.": "黑龙的恶意影响还可能导致自发地创造出邪恶的晃动土丘，寻找并杀死接近龙巢的善良生物。",
	"Kobolds infest the lairs of many black dragons like vermin. They become as cruel as their dark masters, often torturing and weakening captives with centipede bites and scorpion stings before delivering them to sate the dragon's hunger.": "哥布林像害虫一样在许多黑龙的巢穴中出没。他们变得和他们的黑暗主人一样残忍，经常用蜈蚣咬和蝎子刺来折磨和削弱俘虏，然后再把他们送去满足龙的饥渴。",
	"Black dragons hoard the treasures and magic items of crumbled empires and conquered kingdoms to remind themselves of their greatness. The more civilizations a dragon outlasts, the more entitled it feels to claim the wealth of current civilizations for itself.": "黑龙囤积着崩溃的帝国和被征服的王国的财宝和魔法物品，以提醒自己的伟大。龙的文明越多，它就越觉得有资格为自己索取当前文明的财富。",
	"Black dragons dwell in swamps on the frayed edges of civilization. A black dragon's lair is a dismal cave, grotto, or ruin that is at least partially flooded, providing pools where the dragon rests, and where its victims can ferment. The lair is littered with the acid-pitted bones of previous victims and the fly-ridden carcasses of fresh kills, watched over by crumbling statues. Centipedes, scorpions, and snakes infest the lair, which is filled with the stench of death and decay.": "黑龙居住在文明边缘的沼泽地。黑龙的巢穴是一个阴暗的洞穴、石窟或废墟，至少部分被水淹没，提供龙休息的水池，以及它的受害者可以发酵的地方。巢穴里到处都是以前受害者的酸蚀骨头和新杀的苍蝇尸体，由摇摇欲坠的雕像看管。蜈蚣、蝎子和蛇在巢穴里出没，巢穴里充满了死亡和腐烂的臭味。",

	"Oozes thrive in the dark, shunning areas of bright light and extreme temperatures. They flow through the damp underground, feeding on any creature or object that can be dissolved, slinking along the ground, dripping from walls and ceilings, spreading across the edges of underground pools, and squeezing through cracks.": "渗水虫在黑暗中茁壮成长，避开强光和极端温度的区域。它们在潮湿的地下流动，以任何可以溶解的生物或物体为食，沿着地面滑行，从墙壁和天花板上滴下，在地下水池的边缘蔓延，并从裂缝中挤入。",
	"The first warning an adventurer receives of an ooze's presence is often the searing pain of its acidic touch. Oozes are drawn to movement and warmth. Organic material nourishes them, and when prey is scarce they feed on grime, fungus, and offal. Veteran explorers know that an immaculately clean passageway is a likely sign that an ooze lairs nearby.": "冒险者收到的第一个警告，往往是它的酸性触摸带来的灼热疼痛。渗水者被运动和温暖所吸引。有机物能滋养它们，当猎物匮乏时，它们以污垢、真菌和内脏为食。资深的探险家们知道，一个干净的通道很可能是一种迹象，表明附近有渗出物栖息。",
	" An ooze kills its prey slowly. Some varieties, such as black puddings and gelatinous cubes, engulf creatures to prevent escape. The only upside of this torturous death is that a victim's comrades can come to the rescue before it is too late.": " 渗出物会慢慢杀死它的猎物。有些品种，如黑色布丁和胶状方块，会吞噬生物以防止逃跑。这种折磨人的死亡的唯一好处是，受害者的战友可以在太晚之前赶来救援。",
	"Since not every ooze digests every type of substance, some have coins, metal gear, bones, and other debris suspended within their quivering bodies. A slain ooze can be a rich source of treasure for its killers.": "由于并不是每只敖包都能消化每一种物质，有些敖包的颤抖的身体里悬浮着硬币、金属装备、骨头和其他碎片。一个被杀的渗水者可以为其杀手提供丰富的财宝。",
	"Whether this is true or not, the Faceless Lord is one of the few beings that can control oozes and imbue them with a modicum of intelligence. Most of the time, oozes have no sense of tactics or self-preservation. They are direct and predictable, attacking and eating without cunning. Under the control of Juiblex, they exhibit glimmers of sentience and malevolent intent.": "无论这是否属实，无面者之王是少数能控制ozes并给它们注入适度智慧的生命之一。大多数时候，ozes没有战术或自我保护的意识。它们是直接的、可预测的，攻击和吃东西都不狡猾。在Juiblex的控制下，它们表现出一丝有意识和邪恶的意图。",
	" Although an ooze lacks the intelligence to ally itself with other creatures, others that understand an ooze's need to feed might lure it into a location where it can be of use to them. Clever monsters keep oozes around to defend passageways or consume refuse. Likewise, an ooze can be enticed into a pit trap, where its captors feed it often enough to prevent it from coming after them. Crafty creatures place torches and flaming braziers in strategic areas to dissuade an ooze from leaving a particular tunnel or room.": " 虽然渗水虫缺乏与其他生物结盟的智慧，但其他了解渗水虫需要进食的生物可能会把它引诱到一个对它们有用的地方。聪明的怪物会在周围养一些渗水体来保卫通道或消耗垃圾。同样地，也可以引诱渗水者进入坑道陷阱，让捕捉者经常喂食它，以防止它来追杀他们。狡猾的生物在战略区域放置火把和燃烧的火炉，以劝阻渗水者离开某个特定的通道或房间。",
	" According to the Demonomicon of Iggwilv and other sources, oozes are scattered fragments or offspring of the demon lord Juiblex.": " 根据Iggwilv的Demonomicon和其他资料，ozes是散落的碎片或恶魔领主Juiblex的后代。",
	" An ooze doesn't require sleep.": " 渗出物不需要睡眠。",
	"A blink dog takes its name from its ability to blink in and out of existence, a talent it uses to aid its attacks and to avoid harm. Blink dogs harbor a long-standing hatred for displacer beasts and attack them on sight.": "眨眼狗的名字来自于它的眨眼能力，它用这种能力来帮助其攻击和避免伤害。眨眼狗对流离失所的野兽怀有长期的仇恨，一见到它们就会攻击。",

Blood hawks flock together in large numbers, attacking as a pack to take down prey.": "血鹰的名字来自于它深红色的羽毛和好斗的天性，它无所畏惧地攻击几乎所有的动物，用它匕首般的喙来刺杀它们。血鹰大量聚集在一起，作为一个群体攻击，以拿下猎物。",
	"Vain and territorial, blue dragons soar through the skies over deserts, preying on caravans and plundering herds and settlements in the verdant lands beyond the desert's reach. These dragons can also be found in dry steppes, searing badlands, and rocky coasts. They guard their territories against all potential competitors, especially brass dragons.": "虚荣心和领土意识，蓝龙在沙漠的天空中翱翔，捕食商队，掠夺沙漠以外的青翠土地上的畜群和定居点。这些龙也可以在干燥的大草原、灼热的坏境和岩石海岸找到。它们守护着自己的领地，防止所有潜在的竞争者，尤其是黄铜龙。",

	"A blue dragon's scales vary in color from an iridescent azure to a deep indigo, polished to a glossy finish by the desert sands. As the dragon ages, its scales become thicker and harder, and its hide hums and crackles with static electricity. These effects intensify when the dragon is angry or about to attack, giving off an odor of ozone and dusty air.": "蓝龙的鳞片颜色各异，从五彩斑斓的天蓝色到深邃的靛蓝色，被沙漠中的沙子打磨成光亮的表面。随着龙的年龄增长，它的鳞片会变得更厚更硬，它的皮会发出嗡嗡声和静电的噼啪声。当龙生气或要攻击时，这些效果就会加强，散发出臭氧和灰尘的气味。",
	"A blue dragon will not stand for any remark or insinuation that it is weak or inferior, taking great pleasure in lording its power over humanoids and other lesser creatures.": "蓝龙不会容忍任何关于它软弱或低劣的评论或影射，它非常乐于将自己的力量凌驾于人类和其他较小的生物之上。",

	"Though they sometimes eat cacti and other desert plants to sate their great hunger, blue dragons are carnivores. They prefer to dine on herd animals, cooking those creatures with their lightning breath before gorging themselves. Their dining habits make blue dragons an enormous threat to desert caravans and nomadic tribes, which become convenient collections of food and treasure to a dragon's eye.": "虽然它们有时会吃仙人掌和其他沙漠植物来满足它们巨大的饥饿感，但蓝龙是食肉动物。它们更喜欢吃群居动物，在大快朵颐之前用它们的闪电气息烹饪这些生物。它们的饮食习惯使蓝龙成为沙漠商队和游牧部落的巨大威胁，在龙的眼里，这些商队和部落都是方便的食物和财宝的集合体。",
	"When it hunts, a blue dragon buries itself in the desert sand so that only the horn on its nose pokes above the surface, appearing to be an outcropping of stone. When prey draws near, the dragon rises up, sand pouring from its wings like an avalanche as it attacks.": "狩猎时，蓝龙把自己埋在沙漠的沙子里，只有鼻子上的角露出水面，看起来就像一块突出的石头。当猎物靠近时，龙就会站起来，在攻击时，沙子会像雪崩一样从它的翅膀上涌出。",

Bards, sages, artists, wizards, and assassins can become valuable agents for a blue dragon, which rewards loyal service handsomely.": "蓝龙垂涎有价值和有才华的生物，他们的服务能加强他们的优越感。吟游诗人、法师、艺术家、巫师和刺客都可以成为蓝龙的有价值的代理人，蓝龙会对忠诚的服务给予丰厚的回报。",
	"A blue dragon keeps its lair secret and well protected, and even its most trusted servants are rarely allowed within. It encourages ankhegs, giant scorpions, and other creatures of the desert to dwell near its lair for additional security. Older blue dragons sometimes attract air elementals and other creatures to serve them.": "蓝龙将自己的巢穴保密并保护得很好，即使是它最信任的仆人也很少被允许进入。它鼓励阿克塞斯、巨蝎和其他沙漠生物居住在它的巢穴附近，以增加安全感。年长的蓝龙有时会吸引空气元素和其他生物为其服务。",

When it returns later, it collects its possessions-along with the wealth of the dead intruders.": "如果蓝龙的巢穴被入侵，它就会把构成其巢穴的洞穴弄塌。然后，龙会钻出洞穴，让攻击者被压死和窒息。当它后来回来时，它会收集它的财产--连同死去的入侵者的财富。",
	"The bone hooks that protrude from the back of a blue slaad's hands inflict a terrible transformative disease on humanoids wounded by them.

	"Driven by hate, lust, and envy, bone devils act as the cruel taskmasters of the Nine Hells. They set weaker devils to work, taking special delight in seeing fiends that defy them demoted.

	"A bone devil appears as a humanoid husk, with dried skin stretched tight across its skeletal frame. It bears a fearsome skull-like head and the tail of a scorpion, and a foul odor of decay hangs in the air around it.

	"In response to the long history of conflict between the yuan-ti and the nagas, yuan-ti created a necromantic ritual that could halt a naga's resurrection by transforming the living naga into a skeletal undead servitor. A bone naga retains only a few of the spells it knew in life.": "为了应对元帝和纳迦人之间长期以来的冲突，元帝创造了一种亡灵仪式，可以通过将活着的纳迦变成一个骷髅般的不死仆从来阻止纳迦的复活。骨质纳迦只保留了它生前知道的一些法术。",

As a brass dragon grows older, its pupils fade until its eyes resemble molten metal orbs.": "黄铜龙的头部是由从其前额扩展出来的宽大的保护板和从其下巴突出的尖刺所界定的。它的脖子上有一条流苏，其渐变的翅膀一直延伸到尾巴的长度。黄铜龙的鳞片是一种暗淡的、斑驳的棕色。随着年龄的增长，龙的鳞片开始发亮，最终呈现出温暖、灼热的光泽。它的翅膀和褶皱的边缘是斑驳的绿色，随着年龄的增长而变暗。随着黄铜龙的年龄增长，它的瞳孔逐渐缩小，直到它的眼睛像熔化的金属球。",
	"A brass dragon engages in conversations with thousands of creatures throughout its long life, accumulating useful information which it will gladly share for gifts of treasure. If an intelligent creature tries to leave a brass dragon's presence without engaging in conversation, the dragon follows it.

When it wakes, the creature finds itself pinned to the ground by giant claws or buried up to its neck in the sand while the dragon's thirst for small talk is slaked.": "黄铜龙在其漫长的一生中与数以千计的生物进行对话，积累有用的信息，并乐意分享这些信息以换取财宝。如果一个聪明的生物试图离开铜龙的存在而不进行对话，铜龙就会跟踪它。如果该生物试图用魔法或武力逃跑，龙可能会以愤怒的方式回应，用它的睡眠气体使该生物失去能力。当它醒来时，生物会发现自己被巨大的爪子钉在地上，或者被埋在沙子里，而龙对闲谈的渴求却被满足了。",

	"Brass dragons conceal their hoards under mounds of sand or in secret places far from their primary lairs. They have no trouble remembering where their treasure is buried, and therefore have no need for maps.

	"A ribbed and fluted crest defines the shape of a bronze dragon's head. Curving horns extend out from the crest, echoed by spines on its lower jaw and chin. To help them swim, bronze dragons have webbed feet and smooth scales.

The pupils of a bronze dragon's eyes fade as the dragon ages, until they resemble glowing green orbs.": "一个有棱有角的徽章确定了青铜龙的头部形状。弯曲的角从峰顶延伸出来，与下颌和下巴上的刺相呼应。为了帮助它们游泳，青铜龙有带蹼的脚和光滑的鳞片。青铜龙的鳞片是带有绿色的黄色；只有当龙接近成年时，它的颜色才会加深到更深、更丰富的青铜色调。青铜龙的瞳孔会随着年龄的增长而变淡，直到它们像发光的绿色球体。",
	"Bronze dragons love to watch ships traveling up and down the coastlines near their lairs, sometimes taking the forms of dolphins or seagulls to inspect those ships and their crews more closely.

If the dragon finds a worthy addition to its hoard, it barters with the ship's captain for the item.": "青铜龙喜欢观察在其巢穴附近的海岸线上行驶的船只，有时会化身为海豚或海鸥，更仔细地检查这些船只及其船员。大胆的青铜龙可能会化身为鸟或老鼠溜上一艘船，检查船舱里的财宝。如果青铜龙发现了值得收藏的东西，它就会与船长进行交易，以获得该物品。",
	"Bronze dragons actively oppose tyranny, and many bronze dragons yearn to test their mettle by putting their size and strength to good use.

	" Bronze dragons loot sunken ships and also collect colorful coral and pearls from the reefs and seabeds near their lairs. When a bronze dragon pledges to help an army wage war against tyranny, it asks for nominal payment. If such a request is beyond its allies' means, it might settle for a collection of old books on military history or a ceremonial item commemorating the alliance. A bronze dragon might also lay claim to a treasure held by the enemy that it feels would be safer under its protection.": " 青铜龙掠夺沉船，也从其巢穴附近的礁石和海床上收集五颜六色的珊瑚和珍珠。当青铜龙承诺帮助一支军队对暴政发动战争时，它要求得到象征性的报酬。如果这种要求超出了它的盟友的能力，它可能会以收集军事历史方面的旧书或纪念联盟的仪式物品作为补偿。青铜龙也可能对敌人持有的财宝提出要求，它认为在它的保护下会更安全。",

	"Bugbears are often found in the company of their cousins, hobgoblins and goblins. Bugbears usually enslave goblins they encounter, and they bully hobgoblins into giving them gold and food in return for serving as scouts and shock troops. Even when paid, bugbears are at best unreliable allies, yet goblins and hobgoblins understand that no matter how much bugbears might drain a tribe of resources, these creatures are a potent force.": "虫熊经常与它们的表亲霍布林和地精在一起。虫熊通常会奴役他们遇到的地精，他们欺负地精给他们黄金和食物，作为侦察兵和冲击部队的回报。即使有了钱，虫熊充其量也是不可靠的盟友，然而地精和妖精明白，无论虫熊如何消耗部落的资源，这些生物都是一种强大的力量。",
	"Bugbears worship Hruggek, a lesser god who dwells on the plane of Acheron. In the absence of their goblinoid kin, bugbears form loose war bands, each one led by its fiercest member. Bugbears believe that when they die, their spirits have a chance to fight at Hruggek's side. They try to prove themselves worthy by defeating as many foes as possible.": "虫族崇拜Hruggek，他是居住在Acheron平面上的一个较小的神。在没有地精亲属的情况下，虫族组成了松散的战队，每个战队由其最凶猛的成员领导。虫人相信，当他们死后，他们的灵魂有机会在赫鲁格克身边战斗。他们试图通过击败尽可能多的敌人来证明自己的价值。",
	"Despite their intimidating builds, bugbears move with surprising stealth. They are fond of setting ambushes and flee when outmatched. They are dependable mercenaries as long as they are supplied food, drink, and treasure, but a bugbear forgets any bond when its life is on the line.

Afterward, that bugbear might help pursuers track down its former companions if doing so saves its life.": "尽管它们的身材令人生畏，但虫熊的行动却令人惊讶地隐蔽。他们喜欢设下埋伏，在不敌的情况下逃跑。只要有食物、饮料和财宝供应，它们就是可靠的雇佣兵，但当生命危在旦夕的时候，虫熊就会忘记任何纽带。一个受伤的虫族成员可能会被留下来帮助其他成员逃跑。之后，这只虫熊可能会帮助追捕者追踪它以前的同伴，如果这样做能救它的命的话。",

	"Bulettes use their powerful claws to tunnel through the earth when they hunt. Heedless of obstruction, they uproot trees, cause landslides in loose slopes, and leave sinkholes behind them. When vibrations in the soil and rock alert a bulette to movement, it shoots to the surface, its jaws spread wide as it attacks.": "Bulettes在捕猎时用它们强大的爪子在土里挖隧道。它们不顾阻碍，将树木连根拔起，在松散的斜坡上造成山体滑坡，并在身后留下天坑。当土壤和岩石的振动提醒布列特的运动时，它就会射向地面，在攻击时张开它的下巴。",
	"A bulette ranges across temperate lands, feeding on any animals and humanoids it comes across.

A bulette loves halfling meat the most, and it is never happier than when chasing plump halflings across an open field.": "布莱特在温带土地上活动，以它遇到的任何动物和人形生物为食。这些生物不喜欢矮人和精灵的肉，尽管它们经常在意识到它们是什么之前就杀死它们。布里特最喜欢半身人的肉，当它在空旷的田野上追逐丰满的半身人时，从来没有比这更快乐的了。",
	"A bulette has no lair, but roams a hunting territory up to thirty miles wide. Its sole criterion for territory is availability of food, and when it has eaten everything in an area, a bulette moves on. These creatures often home in on humanoid settlements, terrorizing them until their panicked residents have fled, or until the bulette is slain.": "布列塔尼没有巢穴，而是在一个宽达30英里的狩猎区漫游。它对领地的唯一标准是是否有食物，当它吃完一个地区的所有东西后，布莱特就会继续前进。这些生物经常在人形定居点附近活动，恐吓他们，直到他们惊慌失措的居民逃离，或者直到布莱特被杀死。",

Bulettes come together only to mate, resulting in a bloody act of claws and teeth that usually ends with the male's death and consumption.": "所有的生物都避开Bulettes，它们把任何会动的东西都当作食物，甚至是其他捕食者和Bulettes。猎犬只有在交配时才会聚集在一起，导致爪子和牙齿的血腥行为，通常以雄性猎犬的死亡和消耗而结束。",
	"Some sages believe the bulette is the result of a mad wizard's experiments at crossbreeding snapping turtles and armadillos, within fusions of demon ichor. Bulettes have been thought to be extinct at different times, but after years without a sighting, the creatures inevitably reappear. Because their young are almost never seen, some sages suspect that bulettes maintain secret nesting grounds from which adults strike out into the world.": "一些圣人认为，布列特是一个疯狂的巫师在融合了恶魔胆汁的情况下，对鳄龟和犰狳进行杂交实验的结果。布列特在不同时期被认为已经灭绝，但在多年未见的情况下，这种生物不可避免地重新出现。由于它们的幼崽几乎从未被人看见，一些圣人怀疑Bulettes保持着秘密的巢穴，而成年的Bulettes则从那里向世界出击。",
	"Life as a bullywug is nasty, brutish, and wet. These frog-headed amphibious humanoids must stay constantly moist, dwelling in rainy forests, marshes, and damp caves.

	"Bullywugs consider themselves the right and proper rulers of the swamps. They follow an etiquette of sorts when dealing with outsiders and each other, subject to the whims and fancies of their leader-a self-styled lord of the muck.

	"A bullywug has two ways to advance among its kind. It can either murder its rivals, though it must take pains to keep its criminal deeds secret, or it can find a treasure or magic item and present it as tribute or a token of obeisance to its liege. A bullywug that murders its rivals without cunning is likely to be executed, so it's more common for bullywugs to stage raids against caravans and settlements, with the goal of securing precious baubles to impress their lords and win their good graces. Invariably, such fine goods are reduced to filthy tatters through abuse and neglect. Once a gift loses its sheen, a bullywug lord invariably demands that its subjects bring it more treasure as tribute.": "恶霸虫有两种方法在同类中取得进步。它可以谋杀对手，尽管它必须努力保持其犯罪行为的秘密，或者它可以找到一个宝藏或魔法物品，并将其作为贡品或向其主子表示敬意的象征。恶霸虫如果不狡猾地谋杀对手，很可能会被处死，所以恶霸虫更常见的是对商队和定居点进行突袭，目的是获得珍贵的宝物，以打动其领主，赢得他们的好感。无可避免的是，这些精美的物品会因为虐待和忽视而变成肮脏的破烂。一旦礼物失去光泽，恶霸领主总是要求其臣民带来更多的财宝作为贡品。",
	"Bullywugs love nothing more than lording over those who trespass on their territories. Their warriors attempt to capture intruders rather than simply slaying them.": "霸王龙最喜欢的就是霸占那些闯入他们领土的人。他们的战士试图捕获入侵者，而不是简单地杀了他们。",
	"Captives are dragged before the king or queen-a bullywug of unusually large size-and forced to beg for mercy. Bribes, treasure, and flattery can trick the bullywug ruler into letting its captives go, but not before it tries to impress its \"guests\" with the majesty of its treasure and its realm. Struck with a deep inferiority complex, bullywug lords fancy themselves as kings and queens, but desperately crave the fear and respect of outsiders.": "俘虏被拖到国王或王后面前--体型异常庞大的恶霸虫，被迫求饶。贿赂、财宝和奉承可以诱使恶霸虫统治者放走俘虏，但在它试图用它的财宝和王国的威严来打动它的 \"客人 \"之前。霸王虫统治者被深深的自卑感所打动，他们自诩为国王和王后，却极度渴望得到外人的恐惧和尊重。",
	"Bullywugs speak a language that allows them to communicate over large areas by croaking like frogs. News of intruders or other events in the swamp spread within minutes across this crude communication system.": "霸王龙说一种语言，使它们能够像青蛙一样通过呱呱叫在大范围内交流。沼泽地里的入侵者或其他事件的消息在几分钟内就会通过这种粗糙的通信系统传播。",
	"Simple concepts in the language are understandable to frogs and toads. Bullywugs use this capability to form strong bonds with giant frogs, which they train as guardians and hunters. Larger specimens are sometimes used as mounts as well. The frogs' ability to swallow creatures whole provides a bullywug hunting band an easy means of carrying prey back to their villages.": "语言中的简单概念对青蛙和蟾蜍来说是可以理解的。霸王蛙利用这种能力与巨蛙形成牢固的联系，他们把巨蛙训练成守护者和猎手。较大的标本有时也被用来作为坐骑。青蛙整只吞下生物的能力为恶霸蛙的狩猎队提供了一种将猎物带回村庄的简单手段。",
	"A cambion is the offspring of a fiend (usually a succubus or incubus) and a humanoid (usually a human). Cambions inherit aspects of both parents, but their horns, leathery wings, and sinewy tails are hallmarks of their otherworldly parentage.": "cambion是恶魔（通常是魅魔或妖怪）和类人（通常是人类）的后代。坎比恩继承了父母双方的某些方面，但他们的角、皮质的翅膀和蜿蜒的尾巴是他们异世界的父母的标志。",
	"Cambions grow into ruthless adults whose wickedness and perversion horrifies even the most devoted mortal parent. Even as a youth, a cambion identifies its rightful place as an overlord of mortals. It might orchestrate uprisings in towns and cities, gathering gangs of humanoids and lesser devils to serve it.": "坎比人成长为无情的成年人，他们的邪恶和变态甚至让最忠实的凡人父母感到恐惧。即使在青年时期，坎比恩也会认定自己作为凡人的霸主的合法地位。它可能会在城镇中策划起义，聚集人类和小恶魔的团伙为其服务。",
	"A cambion forced to serve its fiendish parent does so out of admiration and dread, but also with the expectation that it will one day rise to a place of prominence. Cambions raised in the Nine Hells serve as soldiers, envoys, and personal attendants to greater devils. In the Abyss, a cambion carries only as much authority as it can muster through sheer strength and force of will.": "被迫为其恶魔父母服务的坎比恩是出于钦佩和恐惧，但也期望有一天它能升到一个显赫的位置。在九层地狱中长大的坎贝尔作为士兵、特使和更大的恶魔的私人随从。在深渊中，一个坎贝尔只能通过纯粹的力量和意志力来获得尽可能多的权力。",
	"The demon lord Graz'zt is fond of procreating with humanoids who have made pacts with fiends, and he has sired many cambions who help him sow chaos across the multiverse. These cambions are characterized by charcoal-black skin, cloven hooves, six-fingered hands, and unearthly beauty.": "恶魔领主格拉兹兹特（Graz'zt）喜欢与那些与恶魔签订了契约的人类繁衍后代，他孕育了许多帮助他在多元宇宙中播种混乱的cambions。这些cambions的特点是炭黑的皮肤、蹄子、六指的手和超凡脱俗的美貌。",
	"Carrion crawlers scour putrid flesh from carcasses and gobble the slimy bones that remain. They aggressively attack any creature that trespasses on their territory or disturbs their feasting.": "腐尸爬虫从尸体上搜出腐烂的肉，并吞食残留的粘稠的骨头。它们积极地攻击任何闯入它们领地或打扰它们进食的生物。",
	"A carrion crawler follows the scent of death to its food, but it prefers not to compete with other scavengers. These foul creatures thus hunker down in territories where death is plentiful and other carrion eaters have limited mobility. Caves, sewers, dungeons, and forested marshes are their favored lairs, but carrion crawlers are also drawn to battlefields and cemeteries. A carrion crawler roams on the hunt, its tentacles probing the air for the scent of blood or decay. In tunnels or ruins, carrion crawlers scurry across the ceiling as they move toward food. In this way, they avoid contact with oozes, otyughs, and other dangerous inhabitants of the darkness, even as they surprise potential meals that don't think to look up.": "腐肉爬虫循着死亡的气味找到它的食物，但它更喜欢不与其他食腐动物竞争。因此，这些肮脏的生物蜷缩在死亡多的地方，而其他食腐动物的流动性有限。洞穴、下水道、地牢和森林沼泽是它们最喜欢的巢穴，但腐尸爬行者也会被吸引到战场和墓地。腐尸爬行者在狩猎中漫游，它的触角在空气中探寻血腥或腐烂的气味。在隧道或废墟中，腐尸爬虫在走向食物时，会在天花板上乱窜。通过这种方式，它们可以避免接触到渗出物、Otyughs和其他黑暗中的危险居民，甚至让那些没有想到要抬头看的潜在食物感到惊讶。",
	"Whether in subterranean darkness or while hunting at night, light signals a potential meal. A carrion crawler might follow a light source from a distance for hours, hoping to pick up the scent of blood. Despite their great size, carrion crawlers can also easily set up ambushes by waiting around blind corners for prey to come to them. When facing potential prey or intruders, a carrion crawler lets its poison do the work. Once a victim goes rigid with paralysis, the carrion crawler wraps it with its tentacles and drags it away to a high ledge or isolated passageway, where it can be killed safely. The monster then resumes patrolling its territory while waiting for its meal to ripen.": "无论是在地下的黑暗中，还是在夜间狩猎时，光线都是潜在的食物的信号。腐肉爬虫可能会从远处跟踪一个光源几个小时，希望能闻到血的气味。尽管腐肉爬虫的体型很大，但它们也可以很容易地设下埋伏，在盲目的角落里等待猎物来找它们。当面对潜在的猎物或入侵者时，腐尸爬虫会让它的毒药发挥作用。一旦受害者因麻痹而变得僵硬，腐尸爬虫就会用它的触手将其包裹起来，并将其拖到高处的壁架或孤立的通道，在那里可以安全地将其杀死。然后，这只怪物继续在其领地上巡逻，同时等待它的食物成熟。",
	"I hear centaurs make excellent mounts!": "我听说半人马是很好的坐骑!",

	"Centaur migrations span continents and take decades to repeat, so that a centaur tribe might not retread the same path for generations. These long-ranging patterns can lead to conflict when centaurs encounter settlements of other creatures built along their traditional routes.": "半人马的迁徙跨越大陆，需要几十年的时间来重复，所以一个半人马部落可能几代人都不会重走同样的道路。当半人马遇到其他生物在其传统路线上建造的定居点时，这些长距离的模式会导致冲突。",
	"A centaur that can't keep pace with the rest of its tribe is left behind. Some such centaurs vanish into the wilderness and are never seen again. Those that can bear the loss of their tribe might take up residence among other races. Frontier settlements value the nature knowledge of their centaur residents. Many such communities owe their survival to the insight and acumen of a centaur.": "一个半人马如果不能跟上其他部落的步伐，就会被甩在后面。一些这样的半人马消失在荒野中，再也见不到了。那些能够忍受失去部落的人可能会在其他种族中居住。边疆定居点重视半人马居民的自然知识。许多这样的社区的生存归功于半人马的洞察力和敏锐度。",
	"Despite their reclusive nature, centaurs trade with elves and with the caravans of other benevolent humanoids they meet during their wanderings. A trader might save the life of a wounded or an elderly centaur unfit for long travel, escorting it to a settlement where it can peacefully live out the rest of its days.": "尽管半人马生性孤僻，但他们与精灵和其他仁慈的人类商队进行贸易，他们在漫游中遇到了这些商队。商人可能会救一个受伤的或不适合长途旅行的半人马，护送它到一个定居点，让它安然度过余生。",
	"This ominous fiend wears chains like a shroud. Driving lesser creatures before it with its fearsome gaze, a chain devil animates the chains that cover its body as well as inanimate chains nearby, which sprout hooks, blades, and spikes to eviscerate enemies.": "这个不祥的恶魔像裹尸布一样戴着链子。链魔用它可怕的目光驱赶着面前的低等生物，使覆盖在它身上的链子以及附近的无生命的链子都有了活力，这些链子长出了钩子、刀片和尖刺，可以将敌人斩杀。",
	"Chain devils act as sadistic jailers and torturers in the infernal realms, relishing pain and living to inflict it on others. They are called on to torment mortal souls trapped in the Nine Hells, inflicting their sadistic fury on the horrid lemures in which those souls manifest.": "链魔在地狱界充当虐待狂的狱卒和折磨者，以痛苦为乐，以折磨他人为生。他们被要求折磨被困在九层地狱的凡人灵魂，将他们的虐待狂怒气施加在这些灵魂所表现出来的可怕的雷姆身上。",
	"This loathsome demon resembles an unspeakable crossing of humanoid and fly. A chasme shuffles about on four spindly legs that can find purchase on walls and ceilings. A droning sound precedes the approach of a chasme, inflicting foes with a terrible lethargy that leaves them open to attack.": "这种令人厌恶的恶魔类似于一种难以言喻的人形和苍蝇的混合体。查斯梅用四条骨瘦如柴的腿来回走动，可以在墙壁和天花板上找到支撑。在chasme接近之前，会有一阵阵沉闷的声音，给敌人带来可怕的昏睡感，让他们有机会受到攻击。",
	"The lowly chasmes serve more powerful masters as interrogators or taskmasters. A chasme lives to dole out torture as punishment, and has a knack for spotting demons that have deserted their lords. Capturing and returning such traitors allows a chasme to torment the victim without fear of reprisal.": "卑微的查斯米为更强大的主人服务，作为审讯者或任务负责人。查斯姆以施展酷刑为生，并善于发现那些抛弃主人的恶魔。捕获并归还这些叛徒可以让查斯梅在不担心报复的情况下对受害者进行折磨。",
	"Chimeras were created after mortals summoned Demogorgon to the world. The Prince of Demons, unimpressed with the creatures that surrounded it, transformed them into horrific, multi-headed monstrosities. This act gave rise to the first chimeras.": "嵌合体是在凡人将德摩根召唤到这个世界后产生的。恶魔王子对周围的生物不以为然，将它们变成了可怕的多头怪物。这一行为催生了第一批嵌合体。",
	"Gifted with demonic cruelty, a chimera serves as a grim reminder of what happens when demon princes find their way to the Material Plane. A typical specimen has the hindquarters of a large goat, the forequarters of a lion, and the leathery wings of a dragon, along with the heads of all three of those creatures. The monster likes to surprise its victims, swooping down from the sky and engulfing prey with its fiery breath before landing.": "奇美拉被赋予了恶魔的残忍，它是恶魔王子找到物质世界的途径时的一个严峻的提醒。典型的奇美拉有大山羊的后躯，狮子的前躯，龙的皮翼，以及这三种生物的头。这种怪物喜欢给受害者一个惊喜，从空中俯冲而下，在落地前用火热的气息吞噬猎物。",
	"A chimera combines the worst aspects of its three parts. Its dragon head drives it to raid, plunder, and accumulate a great hoard. Its leonine nature compels it to hunt and kill powerful creatures that threaten its territory. Its goat head grants it a vicious, stubborn streak that compels it to fight to the death. These three aspects drive a chimera to stake out a territory that is as large as 10 miles wide. It preys on wild game, viewing more powerful creatures as rivals to be humiliated and defeated. Its greatest rivals are dragons, griffons, manticores, perytons, and wyverns. When it hunts, the chimera looks for easy ways to amuse itself. It enjoys the fear and suffering of weaker creatures. The monster often toys with its prey, breaking off an attack prematurely and leaving a creature wounded and terrified before returning to finish it off.": "奇美拉结合了其三个部分的最坏方面。它的龙首驱使它突袭、掠夺和积累大量的囤积物。它的龙性迫使它猎杀威胁其领土的强大生物。它的山羊头赋予它恶毒、顽固的性格，迫使它战斗到死。这三个方面促使奇美拉划定一个宽达10英里的领土。它以野生动物为食，将更多强大的生物视为需要羞辱和击败的对手。它最大的对手是龙、狮鹫、曼蒂克龙、Perytons和翼龙。当它狩猎时，奇美拉会寻找简单的方法来消遣自己。它喜欢弱小生物的恐惧和痛苦。这种怪物经常玩弄它的猎物，过早地中断攻击，让一个生物受伤和惊恐，然后再回来把它干掉。",
	"Though chimeras are far from cunning, their draconic ego makes them susceptible to flattery and gifts. If offered food and treasure, a chimera might spare a traveler. A villain can lure a chimera into service by keeping it well fed and its treasure hoard well stocked.": "虽然奇美拉远非狡猾，但他们的龙族自我意识使他们容易受到奉承和礼物的影响。如果提供食物和财宝，奇美拉可能会放过一个旅行者。恶棍可以引诱奇美拉为其服务，让它吃饱喝足，让它的财宝囤积起来。",
	"The black, blue, green, red, and white dragons represent the evil side of dragonkind. Aggressive, gluttonous, and vain, chromatic dragons are dark sages and powerful tyrants feared by all creatures-including each other.": "黑龙、蓝龙、绿龙、红龙和白龙代表了龙族的邪恶面。侵略性强、贪吃、虚荣，色龙是黑暗的圣人和强大的暴君，为所有生物所惧怕--包括彼此之间。",
	" Chromatic dragons lust after treasure, and this greed colors their every scheme and plot. They believe that the world's wealth belongs to them by right, and a chromatic dragon seizes that wealth without regard for the humanoids and other creatures that have \"stolen\" it. With its piles of coins, gleaming gems, and magic items, a dragon's hoard is the stuff of legend. However, chromatic dragons have no interest in commerce, amassing wealth for no other reason than to have it.": " 色素龙贪恋财宝，这种贪婪使他们的每一个计划和阴谋都充满色彩。他们认为，世界上的财富理所当然地属于他们，而色龙夺取这些财富时，并不考虑那些 \"偷走 \"财富的人类和其他生物。凭借成堆的硬币、闪闪发光的宝石和魔法物品，龙的囤积物是传说中的东西。然而，色龙对商业没有兴趣，它们积累财富的原因无非是为了拥有它。",
	"Chromatic dragons are united by their sense of superiority, believing themselves the most powerful and worthy of all mortal creatures. When they interact with other creatures, it is only to further their own interests. They believe in their innate right to rule, and this belief is the cornerstone of every chromatic dragon's personality and worldview. Trying to humble a chromatic dragon is like trying to convince the wind to stop blowing. To these creatures, humanoids are animals, fit to serve as prey or beasts of burden, and wholly unworthy of respect.": "色素龙因其优越感而团结在一起，认为自己是所有凡人生物中最强大和最有价值的。当他们与其他生物互动时，只是为了促进自己的利益。他们相信自己有与生俱来的统治权，这种信念是每条色龙的个性和世界观的基石。试图羞辱一条色龙就像试图说服风停止吹动。对这些生物来说，人类是动物，适合作为猎物或负担的野兽，完全不值得尊重。",
	"A dragon's lair serves as the seat of its power and a vault for its treasure. With its innate toughness and tolerance for severe environmental effects, a dragon selects or builds a lair not for shelter but for defense, favoring multiple entrances and exits, and security for its hoard.": "龙的巢穴是其权力的所在地，也是其财宝的保险库。凭借其天生的坚韧和对严重环境影响的耐受力，龙选择或建造巢穴的目的不是为了避难，而是为了防御，倾向于多个入口和出口，并为其囤积物提供安全保障。",
	"Most chromatic dragon lairs are hidden in dangerous and remote locations to prevent all but the most audacious mortals from reaching them. A black dragon might lair in the heart of a vast swamp, while a red dragon might claim the caldera of an active volcano. In addition to the natural defenses of their lairs, powerful chromatic dragons use magical guardians, traps, and subservient creatures to protect their treasures.": "大多数色龙的巢穴都隐藏在危险和偏远的地方，除了最大胆的凡人之外，其他的人都无法接近它们。黑龙的巢穴可能在一个巨大的沼泽中心，而红龙则可能在一座活火山的破火山口上。除了巢穴的自然防御外，强大的色龙还使用魔法守护者、陷阱和顺从的生物来保护它们的宝藏。",
	"Tiamat the Dragon Queen is the chief deity of evil dragonkind. She dwells on Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. As a lesser god, Tiamat has the power to grant spells to her worshipers, though she is loath to share her power. She epitomizes the avarice of evil dragons, believing that the multiverse and all its treasures will one day be hers and hers alone.": "龙后提亚马特（Tiamat）是邪恶龙族的主要神灵。她居住在九层地狱的第一层--阿弗努斯。作为一个小神，提亚马特有能力向她的崇拜者授予法术，尽管她不愿意分享她的力量。她是恶龙贪婪的缩影，认为多元宇宙及其所有的宝藏有一天会属于她，而且只属于她。",
	"Tiamat is a gigantic dragon whose five heads reflect the forms of the chromatic dragons that worship her-black, blue, green, red, and white. She is a terror on the battlefield, capable of annihilating whole armies with her five breath weapons, her formidable spellcasting, and her fearsome claws.": "提亚马特是一条巨大的龙，她的五个头反映了崇拜她的色龙的形态--黑色、蓝色、绿色、红色和白色。她是战场上的恐怖，能够用她的五种呼吸武器、可怕的法术和可怕的爪子消灭整个军队。",
	"Tiamat's most hated enemy is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon, with whom she shares control of the faith of dragonkind.

	"In the primeval ages, aboleths ruled a vast empire that spanned the oceans of the world. In those days, the aboleths used mighty magic and bent the minds of the nascent creatures of the mortal realm. However, they were bound to the water and could not enforce their will beyond it without servants. Therefore, they created chuuls.": "在原始时代，阿波利斯统治着一个横跨世界各大洋的庞大帝国。在那些日子里，阿波勒斯使用强大的魔法，并屈服于凡人界新生生物的思想。然而，他们被束缚在水中，没有仆人就无法在水面上执行他们的意志。因此，他们创造了丘尔。",
	"Perfectly obedient, the chuuls collected sentient creatures and magic at the aboleths' command. Chuuls were designed to endure the ages of the world, growing in size and strength as the eons passed. When the aboleths' empire crumbled with the rise of the gods, the chuuls were cast adrift. However, these creatures continue to do what they did for the aboleths, slowly collecting humanoids, gathering treasure, amassing magic, and consolidating power.": "Chuuls完全服从命令，在aboleths的指挥下收集有生命的生物和魔法。Chuuls被设计成能够经受住世界的岁月考验，随着时间的推移，它们的体型和力量都在不断增长。当boleths的帝国随着众神的崛起而瓦解时，chuuls被抛在了海上。然而，这些生物继续做着他们为aboleths所做的事情，慢慢地收集人类，收集宝藏，积累魔法，并巩固权力。",

Rumors and ancient maps sometimes lure treasure seekers to these ruins, but the reward for their boldness is death.": "楚尔人仍然守卫着古老的阿波利斯帝国的废墟。他们默默地遵守着古老的命令而徘徊。谣言和古老的地图有时会引诱寻宝者来到这些废墟，但对他们的大胆行为的回报是死亡。",
	"Whatever riches that the explorers bring with them adds to the hoard guarded by the chuuls. Chuuls can sense magic at a distance. This sense couples with an innate drive that leads them to slay explorers, take their gear, and bury it in secret locales aboleths dictated eons ago.": "无论探险者带来什么财富，都会增加楚乌尔人所守护的囤积物。丘尔人可以在远处感知魔法。这种感觉与一种与生俱来的驱动力相结合，导致他们杀死探险家，拿走他们的装备，并将其埋藏在远古时代所指定的秘密地点。",
	"Although the aboleths' ancient empire fell long ago, the psychic bonds between them and their created servants remain intact. Chuuls that come into contact with aboleths immediately assume their old roles.

	"Cloud giants are spread to the winds, encompassing vast areas of the world. In times of need, scattered cloud giant families band together as a unified clan. However, they can seldom do so quickly.": "云巨人散布在风中，涵盖了世界的广大地区。在需要的时候，分散的云巨人家族会团结起来，成为一个统一的部族。然而，他们很少能迅速做到这一点。",
	"Attuned to the magic of their airy domains, cloud giants are able to turn into mist and create clouds of billowing fog. They dwell in castles on high mountain peaks, or on the solid clouds that once held their fiefs.": "适应了他们空中领域的魔法，云雾巨人能够变成雾，并创造出波涛汹涌的云雾。他们居住在高高的山峰上的城堡里，或者居住在曾经拥有他们领地的坚实的云层上。",
	"Still gracing the skies on occasion, these magic clouds are a lasting remnant of the giants' lost empires. Better spellcasters than most other giants, some cloud giants can control weather, bring storms, and steer the wind almost as well as their cousins, the storm giants.": "这些神奇的云彩偶尔还会出现在天空中，它们是巨人失落的帝国的一个持久的遗留物。比大多数其他巨人更好的施法者，一些云巨人可以控制天气，带来风暴，并引导风向，几乎和他们的表亲，风暴巨人一样好。",
	"Although cloud giants are lower in the ordning than storm giants, the reclusive storm giants rarely engage with the rest of giantkind. As a result, many cloud giants see themselves as having the highest status and power among the giant races.": "虽然云巨人的地位比风暴巨人低，但隐居的风暴巨人很少与其他巨人族接触。因此，许多云巨人认为自己在巨人种族中拥有最高的地位和权力。",
	"They order lesser giants to seek out wealth and art on their behalf, employing fire giants as smiths and crafters, and using frost giants as reavers, raiders, and plunderers. Dimwitted hill giants serve them as brutes and combat fodder-sometimes fighting for the cloud giants' amusement. A cloud giant might order hill or frost giants to steal from nearby humanoid lands, which it considers to be a fair tax for its continued beneficence. On their mountain summits and solid clouds, cloud giants keep extraordinary gardens. Grapes as big as apples grow there, along with apples the size of pumpkins, and pumpkins the size of wagons. From the errant seeds of these gardens, tales of cottage sized produce and magic beans are spread in the mortal realm.": "他们命令较小的巨人代表他们寻找财富和艺术，雇用火巨人作为铁匠和工匠，利用冰霜巨人作为掠夺者、袭击者和掠夺者。愚蠢的山地巨人为他们服务，充当野蛮人和战斗的炮灰--有时为云巨人的娱乐而战斗。云雾巨人可能会命令山丘巨人或冰霜巨人从附近的人形土地上偷东西，它认为这是对它的持续恩惠的公平税收。在他们的山顶和坚实的云层上，云巨人保持着非凡的花园。那里生长着像苹果一样大的葡萄，还有像南瓜一样大的苹果，以及像马车一样大的南瓜。从这些花园的错误种子中，山寨产品和魔豆的故事在凡人的世界里传播。",
	"As humanoid nobles keep an aerie for hunting hawks, so do cloud giants keep griffons, perytons, and wyverns as their own flying beasts of prey. Such creatures also patrol the cloud giants' gardens by night, along with trained predators such as owlbears and lions.": "就像人形贵族为狩猎鹰保留了一个小房间一样，云巨人也保留了狮鹫、perytons和狼獾作为他们自己的飞行猎物。这些生物也会在夜间巡逻云巨人的花园，同时还有训练有素的捕食者，如猫头鹰和狮子。",
	"The patron god and father of the cloud giants is Memnor the Trickster, the cleverest and slyest of the giant deities. Cloud giants align themselves according to the aspects and exploits of Memnor that they most admire, with evil cloud giants emulating his deceitfulness and self-interest and good cloud giants emulating his intellect and silver-tongued speech. Family members usually align in the same direction.": "云雾巨人的守护神和父亲是诡计多端的梅姆诺，他是最聪明、最狡猾的巨人神。云巨人根据他们最崇拜的梅姆诺的方面和功绩来结盟，邪恶的云巨人模仿他的欺骗和自我利益，善良的云巨人模仿他的智慧和银舌。家庭成员通常向同一方向看齐。",
	"A cloud giant earns its place in the ordning by the treasure it accumulates, the wealth it wears, and the gifts it bestows on other cloud giants.": "一个云端巨人通过其积累的宝藏、佩戴的财富和给予其他云端巨人的礼物来赢得其在条例中的地位。",
	"However, value is only one part of the assessment. The extravagances a cloud giant wears or places about its home must also be beautiful or wondrous. Sacks of gold or gems are worth less to a cloud giant than the jewelry that might be crafted from those materials, creating treasures that bring esteem to a cloud giant's household.": "然而，价值只是评估的一个部分。云雾巨人所穿戴的或摆放在家中的奢侈物品也必须是美丽或奇妙的。对云巨人来说，一袋金子或宝石的价值不如用这些材料制作的珠宝，创造的宝物能给云巨人的家庭带来尊贵。",
	"Rather than steal from one another or fight over treasures, cloud giants are inveterate gamblers with a hunger for high risks and high rewards. They frequently bet on the outcome of events nominally outside their control, such as the lives of lesser creatures. Ordning ranks and kings' ransoms can be won and lost in bets over the military triumphs of humanoid nations. Fixing wagers by interfering in the conflict causes the loss of the bet, but such deceit is considered to be cheating only if it is discovered. Otherwise, it is cleverness honoring Memnor.": "与其互相偷窃或争夺宝物，云巨人是不折不扣的赌徒，渴望高风险和高回报。他们经常在名义上不受他们控制的事件的结果上下注，例如较小的生物的生命。在对人形国家的军事胜利的赌注中，可以赢得或输掉军衔和国王的赎金。通过干涉冲突来固定赌注会导致赌注的损失，但这种欺骗只有在被发现时才被认为是作弊。否则，它就是尊重Memnor的聪明才智。",
	"The cockatrice looks like a hideous hybrid of lizard, bird, and bat, and it is infamous for its ability to turn flesh to stone. These omnivores have a diet that consists of berries, nuts, flowers, and small animals such as insects, mice, and frogs-things they can swallow whole. They would be no threat to anything else if not for their fierce and frenzied response to even a hint of danger. A cockatrice flies into the face of any threat, squawking and madly beating its wings as its head darts out to peck. The smallest scratch from a cockatrice's beak can spell doom as its victim slowly turns to stone from the injury.": "鸡冠花看起来像蜥蜴、鸟和蝙蝠的可怕混合体，它因能把肉体变成石头而臭名昭著。这些杂食动物的食物包括浆果、坚果、花和小动物，如昆虫、老鼠和青蛙--它们可以整个吞下。如果不是因为它们对哪怕是一丝危险的激烈和狂热的反应，它们不会对其他东西构成威胁。凤头鹦鹉面对任何威胁都会飞过来，一边叫一边疯狂地拍打着翅膀，脑袋飞快地往外啄。鸡冠花的喙最小的抓痕也会带来厄运，因为它的受害者会因为受伤而慢慢变成石头。",
	"Commoners include peasants, serfs, slaves, servants, pilgrims, merchants, artisans, and hermits.": "平民包括农民、农奴、奴隶、仆人、朝圣者、商人、工匠和隐士。",

Despite their gregarious and even-tempered natures, they possess a covetous, miserly streak, and can become dangerous when their hoards are threatened.": "铜龙是无可救药的恶作剧者、讲笑话者和谜语者，生活在山丘和岩石高地。尽管他们生性好客，脾气平和，但他们拥有贪婪、吝啬的特质，当他们的囤积物受到威胁时，会变得很危险。",
	"A copper dragon has brow plates jutting over its eyes, extending back to long horns that grow as a series of overlapping segments. Its backswept cheek ridges and jaw frills give it a pensive look. At birth, a copper dragon's scales are a ruddy brown with a metallic tint. As the dragon ages, its scales become more coppery in color, later taking on a green tint as it ages. A copper dragon's pupils fade with age, and the eyes of the oldest copper dragons resemble glowing turquoise orbs.": "铜龙的眉板突出在眼睛上，向后延伸到长长的角，长成一系列重叠的部分。它的背脊和下巴的褶皱使它看起来很沉思。出生时，铜龙的鳞片是红褐色的，带有金属色泽。随着年龄的增长，它的鳞片会变得更加铜色，后来随着年龄的增长会呈现出绿色的色调。铜龙的瞳孔会随着年龄的增长而变淡，最古老的铜龙的眼睛就像发光的绿松石球体。",
	"A copper dragon appreciates wit, a good joke, humorous story, or riddle. A copper dragon becomes annoyed with any creature that doesn't laugh at its jokes or accept its tricks with good humor.": "铜龙欣赏智慧、好的笑话、幽默的故事或谜语。铜龙对任何不笑它的笑话或不幽默地接受它的把戏的生物感到厌烦。",
	"Copper dragons are particularly fond of bards. A dragon might carve out part of its lair as a temporary abode for a bard willing to regale it with stories, riddles, and music. To a copper dragon, such companionship is a treasure to be coveted.": "铜龙特别喜欢吟游诗人。一条龙可能会在它的巢穴中划出一部分，作为一个愿意用故事、谜语和音乐向它倾诉的吟游诗人的临时住所。对铜龙来说，这样的陪伴是一种令人垂涎的财富。",

	"A copper dragon is wary when it comes to showing off its possessions. If it knows that other creatures seek a specific item in its hoard, a copper dragon will not admit to possessing the item. Instead, it might send curious treasure hunters on a wild goose chase to search for the object while it watches from afar for its own pleasure.": "铜龙在炫耀自己的财产时很谨慎。如果它知道其他生物在寻找它囤积的特定物品，铜龙不会承认自己拥有该物品。相反，它可能会派好奇的寻宝者去寻找该物品，而它则在远处观望，以获得自己的乐趣。",
	"Copper dragons dwell in dry uplands and on hilltops, where they make their lairs in narrow caves. False walls in the lair hide secret antechambers where the dragon stores valuable ores, art objects, and other oddities it has collected over its lifetime. Worthless items are put on display in open caves to tantalize treasure seekers and distract them from where the real treasure is hidden.": "铜龙居住在干燥的高地和山顶上，它们在狭窄的洞穴中筑巢。巢穴中的假墙隐藏着秘密的候车室，龙在那里储存有价值的矿石、艺术品和它一生中收集的其他奇珍异宝。不值钱的东西被放在开放的洞穴中展示，以诱惑寻宝者，并分散他们对真正藏宝之处的注意力。",
	"Couatls are benevolent serpentine beings of great intellect and insight. Their brilliantly colored wings and gentle manner speak to their celestial origins.": "库拉特斯是仁慈的蛇形生物，具有伟大的智慧和洞察力。他们色彩艳丽的翅膀和温和的态度说明了他们的天体起源。",
	"Couatls were created as guardians and caretakers by a benevolent god not worshiped since the dawn of time, and which is forgotten now by all but the couatls themselves. Most of the divine mandates given to these beings are long since fulfilled or failed.

Regardless of a couatl's task, it prefers to remain hidden, revealing itself only as a last resort.": "库拉特斯是由一个自古以来就不被崇拜的仁慈的神创造出来的，现在除了库拉特斯自己，所有人都忘记了这个神。大多数赋予这些生命的神圣任务早已完成或失败。然而，一些库拉图仍在守护着古老的力量，等待预言的实现，或者保护他们曾经引导和保护的生物的继承人。无论库拉特斯的任务是什么，它都喜欢保持隐蔽，只有在最后关头才会暴露自己。",
	"A couatl can't lie, but it can withhold information, answer questions vaguely, or allow others to jump to the wrong conclusions if doing so is necessary to protect something, to keep promises, or to hide the secret of its existence.": "库阿特尔不会撒谎，但它可以隐瞒信息，含糊其辞地回答问题，或允许他人得出错误的结论，如果这样做是为了保护某些东西，履行承诺，或隐藏其存在的秘密。",
	"A couatl can live for ages without sustenance, even surviving without air, but these creatures can die of disease or the passage of time. A couatl can sense its end up to a century beforehand, but it has no insight into the manner of its demise. If a couatl has already accomplished what it set out to do, it accepts its fate. However, if its imminent death endangers the completion of its goals, it actively seeks out another couatl with which to produce offspring.": "库阿特尔可以在没有营养的情况下活很久，甚至可以在没有空气的情况下生存，但这些生物可以死于疾病或时间的流逝。库拉图可以提前一个世纪感觉到自己的死亡，但它对自己的死亡方式没有任何洞察力。如果库阿特尔已经完成了它要做的事情，它就会接受自己的命运。然而，如果它的死亡即将威胁到它的目标的完成，它就会积极寻找另一个库阿特尔，并与之产生后代。",
	"The mating ritual of couatls is a beautiful and elaborate dance of magic and light, which results in a gem-like egg from which a new couatl hatches. The parent that sought out the mate raises the newborn couatl and instructs it as to its duties, so that it can complete whatever task the parent leaves unfinished.": "库拉特斯的交配仪式是一种美丽而精致的魔法和光的舞蹈，其结果是产生一个宝石般的蛋，从中孵化出一个新的库拉特斯。寻找配偶的父母将新生的库阿特尔养大，并指导它的职责，以便它能完成父母未完成的任何任务。",
	"Crawling claws are the severed hands of murderers animated by dark magic so that they can go on killing. Wizards and warlocks of a dark bent use crawling claws as extra hands in their labors.": "爬行爪是被黑暗魔法激活的杀人犯的断手，以便他们能够继续杀人。具有黑暗倾向的巫师和术士使用爬行爪作为他们工作中的额外双手。",
	"Through dark necromantic rituals, the life force of a murderer is bound to its severed hand, haunting and animating it.

	"Commands given to a crawling claw must be simple. A claw can't be tasked with finding and killing a particular person, because its limited senses and intelligence prevent it from tracking and picking out specific individuals. However, a command to kill all creatures in a particular locale works. A crawling claw can easily feel out the contours of keys and doorknobs, crawling from room to room on a blind killing spree.": "给予爬行爪的命令必须是简单的。爪子不能被赋予寻找和杀死一个特定的人的任务，因为它有限的感官和智力使它无法追踪和挑选出特定的人。然而，一个杀死某个特定地点的所有生物的命令是可行的。爬行的爪子可以轻易地摸出钥匙和门把手的轮廓，从一个房间爬到另一个房间，进行盲目的杀戮。",
	"A crawling claw possesses little of the intellect and memories of the individual of which it was once a living part. The hate, jealousy, or greed that drove that person to murder lingers on, however, amplified by the claw's torturous fragmented state. Left to its own devices, a crawling claw imitates and recreates the same murderous acts it committed in life.": "爬行的爪子几乎没有智力和记忆，而它曾经是这个人的一个活的部分。然而，驱使那个人杀人的仇恨、嫉妒或贪婪仍然存在，并被爪子的折磨人的分裂状态所放大。如果任其发展，爬行的爪子会模仿并重现其生前的谋杀行为。",
	"If a crawling claw is animated from the severed hand of a still-living murderer, the ritual binds the claw to the murderer's soul. The disembodied hand can then return to its former limb, its undead flesh knitting to the living arm from which it was severed.": "如果一只爬行的爪子从一个仍然活着的杀人犯的断手中活过来，这个仪式会将爪子与杀人犯的灵魂结合起来。然后，这只没有实体的手可以回到它以前的肢体上，它的不死之肉与它被切断的活体手臂交织在一起。",
	"Made whole again, the murderer acts as though the hand had never been severed and the ritual had never taken place. When the crawling claw separates again, the living body falls into a coma.

However, killing the murderer has no effect on the crawling claw.": "凶手重新变得完整，就像手从未被切断，仪式从未发生过一样。当爬行的爪子再次分离时，活着的身体就会陷入昏迷。当爬行的爪子离开身体时，摧毁它可以杀死凶手。然而，杀死凶手对爬行的爪子没有影响。",
	"A crawling claw doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "爬行的爪子不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",

Unlike evil acolytes, cultists often show signs of insanity in their beliefs and practices.": "崇拜者发誓效忠于黑暗力量，如元素王子、恶魔领主或大恶魔。大多数人隐瞒自己的忠诚，以避免因其信仰而被排斥、监禁或处决。与邪恶的信徒不同，邪教分子在他们的信仰和实践中经常表现出精神错乱的迹象。",

	"Legends claim that the cyclopes are the spawn of one of the gods of the giants, but these creatures pay little heed to any deities.

	"Though they are reasonably intelligent, cyclopes live simple, reclusive lives, keeping herds of animals for food. They prefer to dwell alone or in small family groups, lairing in caves, ruins, or rough structures of dry stone construction they build themselves. A cyclops keeps its herd animals with it at night, sealing the entrance to its home with boulders to let it serve double duty as a barn.": "虽然它们相当聪明，但独眼巨人的生活简单而隐蔽，饲养动物作为食物。它们喜欢单独居住或以小家庭为单位，居住在洞穴、废墟或自己建造的干石结构的粗糙建筑中。剑水蚤在夜间将其畜群带在身边，用巨石封住其住所的入口，让它兼做谷仓。",
	"A cyclops lairs within a day's journey of other cyclopes, so that they can meet to trade goods or seek mates. They craft weapons and tools of wood and stone, but will use metal when they can find it. Although cyclopes understand the Giant tongue, they write nothing and speak little, using grunts and gestures for their interactions with each other. Cyclopes don't use money for trade, but they value gold, shells, and other glittering and colorful objects as jewelry. A cyclops might wear a necklace strung with feathers and silver coins, but also with pewter goblets, cutlery, and other bits of ruined metal.": "剑水蚤的巢穴离其他剑水蚤有一天的路程，这样它们就可以见面交易货物或寻找配偶。他们用木头和石头制作武器和工具，但当他们能找到金属时也会使用。虽然独眼巨人能听懂巨人的语言，但他们不会写字，也很少说话，而是用咕哝声和手势进行交流。独眼巨人不使用货币进行交易，但他们重视黄金、贝壳和其他闪闪发光、色彩斑斓的物体作为珠宝。独眼巨人可能会佩戴一条串有羽毛和银币的项链，也可能佩戴锡制高脚杯、餐具和其他废旧金属的碎片。",
	"Cyclopes aren't great thinkers or strategists. Slow to learn and bound to their traditional ways, they find innovation difficult. Although they are a terrifying threat in combat due to their size and strength, they can often be tricked by clever foes. Cyclopes can be cowed and awed by obvious displays of magic. Rustics with little exposure to magic, they can be deceived into mistaking a warlock, cleric, or other caster for a powerful divine figure. However, their sense of pride causes them to react with vengeful, bloodthirsty violence once they learn that the individual they assumed was a \"god\" is a mere mortal.": "独眼巨人并不是伟大的思想家或战略家。他们学习缓慢，受传统方式的束缚，发现创新很困难。尽管由于他们的体型和力量，他们在战斗中是一个可怕的威胁，但他们经常被聪明的敌人所欺骗。独眼巨人可以被明显的魔法展示所吓倒和震慑。由于很少接触到魔法，他们会被欺骗，误以为术士、牧师或其他施法者是强大的神灵人物。然而，一旦他们知道他们认为的 \"神 \"只是一个凡人，他们的自豪感就会使他们做出报复性的、嗜血的暴力反应。",
	"Dao are greedy, malicious genies from the Elemental Plane of Earth.

Unfortunately for the dao, their greed makes it relatively easy for mages to cozen them into service.": "道教以金钱买到的最好的奴隶为交易对象，强迫他们在危险的地下世界工作，这些地方地震不断。尽管他们喜欢奴役他人，但道人却讨厌被奴役。强大的巫师们已经知道将道引诱到物质世界，并将他们困在魔法宝石或铁瓶的范围内。对道来说，不幸的是，他们的贪婪使法师们更容易让他们为之服务。",

	"Genies are as brilliant as they are mighty, as proud as they are majestic. Haughty and decadent, they have a profound sense of entitlement that stems from the knowledge that few creatures except the gods and other genies can challenge their power.": "精灵们既聪明又强大，既骄傲又雄伟。他们傲慢而颓废，有一种深刻的权利感，这源于他们知道除了众神和其他精灵外，很少有生物能挑战他们的权力。",
	" A genie is born when the soul of a sentient living creature melds with the primordial matter of an elemental plane. Only under rare circumstances does such an elemental-infused soul coalesce into a manifest form and create a genie.": " 当有生命的生物的灵魂与元素界的原始物质融为一体时，就会诞生一个精灵。只有在罕见的情况下，这样一个被元素注入的灵魂才会凝聚成一个明显的形式，并创造出一个精灵。",
	"A genie usually retains no connection to the soul that gave it form. That life force is a building block that determines the genie's form and apparent gender, as well as one or two key personality traits. Although they resemble humanoid beings, genies are elemental spirits given physical form. They don't mate with other genies or produce genie offspring, as all new genies are born out of the same mysterious fusion of spirit energy and elemental power. A genie with a stronger connection to its mortal soul might choose to sire a child with a mortal, although such offspring are rare.": "精灵通常与赋予其形态的灵魂没有任何联系。这种生命力是决定精灵形态和明显性别以及一两个关键人格特征的基石。虽然它们与人形生物相似，但精灵是被赋予物理形态的元素精神。他们不与其他精灵交配，也不产生精灵的后代，因为所有新的精灵都是从同样神秘的精神能量和元素力量的融合中诞生。一个与凡人灵魂有更强联系的精灵可能会选择与凡人生下孩子，尽管这样的后代很罕见。",
	"When a genie perishes, it leaves nothing behind except what it was wearing or carrying, along with a small trace of its native element: a pile of dust, a gust of wind, a flash of fire and smoke, or a burst of water and foam.": "当一个精灵灭亡时，除了它所穿戴或携带的东西，以及它的原生元素的一点痕迹外，它什么也没留下：一堆灰尘、一阵风、火和烟的闪光，或水和泡沫的爆发。",
	"In contrast to their love of slaves, most genies loathe being bound to service themselves. A genie obeys the will of another only when bribed or compelled by magic. All genies command the power of their native element, but a rare few also possess the power to grant wishes. For both these reasons, mortal mages often seek to bind genies into service.": "与他们对奴隶的喜爱相反，大多数精灵厌恶被束缚为自己服务。精灵只有在被贿赂或被魔法强迫的情况下才会服从他人的意愿。所有的精灵都掌握着他们本族元素的力量，但也有极少数精灵拥有实现愿望的力量。出于这两个原因，凡人法师经常寻求约束精灵为其服务。",
	"Noble genies cultivate the jealousy and envy of other genies, asserting their superiority at every opportunity. Other genies respect the influence of the noble genies, knowing how unwise it is to defy a creature that can alter reality at a whim.

	"Their miraculous powers, the grandeur of their abodes, and the numbers of their slaves allow some genies to deceive themselves into believing they are as powerful as the gods. Some go so far as to demand that mortals of other realms-even whole continents or worlds-bow down before them.": "他们神奇的力量、宏伟的住所以及奴隶的数量让一些精灵自欺欺人地认为他们和神一样强大。有些人甚至要求其他领域的凡人--甚至整个大陆或世界--在他们面前俯首称臣。",
	" Mortal slaves serve to validate a genie's power and high self-opinion. A hundred flattering voices are music to a genie's ears, while two hundred mortal slaves prostrated at its feet are proof that it is lord and master. Genies view slaves as living property, and a genie without property amounts to nothing among its own kind. As a result, many genies treasure their slaves, treating them as honored members of their households. Evil genies freely threaten and abuse their slaves, but never to the extent that the slaves are no longer of use.": " 凡人奴隶的作用是验证精灵的力量和高尚的自我评价。一百个奉承的声音对精灵来说是一种音乐，而两百个匍匐在它脚下的凡人奴隶则证明它是主宰和主人。精灵将奴隶视为活的财产，而没有财产的精灵在其同类中一无是处。因此，许多精灵珍视他们的奴隶，把他们当作家庭的尊贵成员。邪恶的精灵会自由地威胁和虐待他们的奴隶，但绝不会达到奴隶不再有用的程度。",

If a single mistake is made, a demon that breaks free shows no mercy as it makes its summoner the first victim of its wrath.": "那些愿意冒险召唤恶魔的人可能是为了从它身上获取信息，迫使它为自己服务，或者派它去完成只有绝对邪恶的生物才能完成的任务。准备工作是关键，有经验的召唤师知道特定的咒语和魔法物品可以迫使恶魔屈服于他人的意志。如果犯了一个错误，挣脱束缚的恶魔就会毫不留情地让其召唤者成为其愤怒的第一个受害者。",
	"The Book of Vile Darkness, the Black Scrolls of Ahm, and the Demonomicon of Iggwilv are the foremost authorities on demonic matters.

These demon lords rule through cunning or brute force, hoping to one day claim the prize of absolute control over all the Abyss.": "深渊的混乱力量用黑暗的祝福来奖励那些特别无情和聪明的恶魔，将他们转化为独特的恶魔，其力量可以与诸神相媲美。这些恶魔领主通过狡猾或蛮力进行统治，希望有一天能够获得对整个深渊的绝对控制权。",
	"Although most demon lords rise up from the vast and uncountable mobs of demons rampaging across the Abyss, the plane also rewards outsiders that conquer any of its infinite layers. The elven goddess Lolth became a demon lord after Corellon Larethian cast her into the Abyss for betraying elvenkind. Sages claim that the Dark Prince Graz'zt originated on some other plane before stealing his abyssal title from another long-forgotten demon lord.": "尽管大多数恶魔领主都是从横行于深渊的庞大而难以计数的恶魔群中崛起的，但这个平面也会奖励那些征服了其无限层的外来者。精灵女神洛尔思因背叛精灵族而被科里隆-拉雷西安扔进深渊，之后她成为了恶魔领主。圣人声称黑暗王子格拉兹兹特在从另一个早已被遗忘的恶魔领主那里偷取他的深渊头衔之前，起源于某个其他平面。",
	"The greatest sign of a demon lord's power is its ability to reshape an abyssal realm. A layer of the Abyss controlled by a demon lord becomes a twisted reflection of that fiend's vile personality, and demon lords seldom leave their realms for fear of allowing another creature to reshape and seize it.": "恶魔领主力量的最大标志是其重塑深渊领域的能力。被恶魔领主控制的深渊层成为该恶魔卑劣个性的扭曲反映，恶魔领主很少离开他们的领域，因为害怕让其他生物重塑并夺取它。",
	"As with other demons, a demon lord that dies on another plane has its essence return to the Abyss, where it reforms into a new body. Likewise, a demon lord that dies in the Abyss is permanently destroyed. Most demon lords keep a portion of their essence safely stored away to prevent such a fate.": "与其他恶魔一样，在另一个位面死亡的恶魔领主，其本质会回到深渊，在那里它将被改造成一个新的身体。同样地，死在深渊的恶魔领主也会被永久地摧毁。大多数恶魔领主将他们的一部分精华安全地储存起来，以防止这种命运。",
	"The demon lord Baphomet, also known as the Horned King and the Prince of Beasts, rules over minotaurs and other savage creatures. If he had his way, civilization would crumble and all races would embrace their base animal savagery.": "恶魔领主巴弗灭，也被称为有角之王和野兽王子，统治着牛头人和其他野蛮的生物。如果他能如愿以偿，文明就会崩溃，所有种族都会拥抱他们的基本动物野性。",
	"The Prince of Beasts appears as a huge, black-furred minotaur with iron horns, red eyes, and a blood-soaked mouth. His iron crown is topped with the rotting heads of his enemies, while his dark armor is set with spikes and skull-like serrations. He carries a huge glaive named Heartcleaver, but often hurls it into the fray so as to face his enemies with horns and hooves.": "野兽王子出现时是一个巨大的、长着黑毛的牛头人，长着铁角、红色的眼睛和一张浸满鲜血的嘴。他的铁冠上顶着敌人腐烂的头颅，而他的黑暗盔甲上镶嵌着尖刺和骷髅般的锯齿。他带着一把名为Heartcleaver的巨大玻璃刀，但经常把它扔到战场上，以便用角和蹄子面对他的敌人。",
	"The Sibilant Beast and the self-styled Prince of Demons, Demogorgon yearns for nothing less than undoing the order of the multiverse. An insane assemblage of features and drives, the Prince of Demons inspires fear and hatred among other demons and demon lords.": "咝咝声的野兽和自称的恶魔王子，德摩根渴望的是破坏多元宇宙的秩序，而不是别的。作为一种疯狂的特征和驱动力的集合体，恶魔王子激发了其他恶魔和恶魔领主的恐惧和仇恨。",
	"Demogorgon towers three times the height of a human, his body as sinuous as a snake's and as powerful as a great ape's. Suckered tentacles take the place of his arms. His saurian lower torso ends in webbed and clawed feet, and a forked tail whose whip-like tips are armed with cruel blades. The Prince of Demons has two baleful baboon heads, both of them mad. It is only the conflict between the two halves of his dual nature that keeps the demon lord's ambitions in check.": "德摩根的身高是人类的三倍，他的身体像蛇一样蜿蜒，像巨猿一样有力。被吸住的触手代替了他的手臂。他的萨乌尔式的下半身末端是有蹼和爪子的脚，还有一条分叉的尾巴，其鞭子般的尖端装有残忍的刀片。恶魔王子有两个可恶的狒狒头，它们都很疯狂。只有他的双重性质的两半之间的冲突才能使恶魔领主的野心得到控制。",
	"The demon lord Graz'zt appears as a darkly handsome figure nearly nine feet tall. Those who refer to the Dark Prince as the most humanoid of the demon lords vastly underestimate the capacity for evil in his scheming heart.": "恶魔领主Graz'zt出现时是一个黑暗的英俊形象，身高近九英尺。那些把黑暗王子称为恶魔领主中最像人类的人，大大低估了他阴险的内心的邪恶能力。",
	"Graz'zt is a striking physical specimen, whose demonic nature shows in his ebon skin, pointed ears, yellow fangs, crown of horns, and six-fingered hands. He delights in finery, pageantry, and sating his decadent desires with subjects and consorts alike, among whom incubi and succubi are often his favorites.": "格拉兹兹特是一个引人注目的身体标本，他的恶魔本性表现在他的乌黑皮肤、尖耳朵、黄色獠牙、角冠和六指的手。他喜欢华丽的服饰、盛装打扮，并与臣民和妃子们一起满足他的颓废欲望，其中的女妖和魅魔往往是他的最爱。",
	"The demon lord of slimes and oozes, Juiblex is a stew of noxious fluids that lurks in the abyssal depths. The wretched Faceless Lord cares nothing for cultists or mortal servants, and its sole desire is to turn all creatures into formless copies of its horrid self.": "作为粘液和渗出物的恶魔领主，朱布莱克斯是潜伏在深渊中的有毒液体的混合物。这个可恶的无面之王对崇拜者或凡人的仆人毫不在意，它唯一的愿望是把所有的生物都变成它可怕的自我的无形拷贝。",
	"In its resting state, Juiblex spreads out in a noxious mass, bubbling and filling the air with a profound stench. On the rare occasions when creatures confront the demon lord, Juiblex draws itself up into a shuddering cone of slime striated with veins of black and green. Baleful red eyes swim within its gelatinous body, while dripping pseudopods of ooze lash out hungrily at any creature they can reach.": "在静止状态下，Juiblex以一种有害的方式扩散开来，冒着气泡，在空气中弥漫着深刻的臭味。在极少数情况下，当生物与恶魔领主对抗时，Juiblex会把自己拉成一个颤抖的锥形粘液，上面有黑色和绿色的纹路。可怕的红色眼睛在它的胶状身体里游动，而滴落的假肢则饥渴地扑向任何它们能触及的生物。",
	"The Demon Queen of Spiders is the evil matron of the drow. Her every thought is touched by malice, and the depth of her viciousness can surprise even her most faithful priestesses. She directs her faithful while she weaves plots across the worlds of the Material Plane, looking forward to the time when her drow followers bring those worlds under her control.": "蜘蛛魔后是鸦人的邪恶女皇。她的每一个想法都被恶意所触动，她的恶毒程度甚至能让她最忠实的女祭司们感到惊讶。她一边指挥着她的信徒，一边在物质界的各个世界编织阴谋，期待着她的乌鸦信徒将这些世界置于她的控制之下。",
	"Lolth appears as a lithe, imperious drow matriarch when she manifests to her followers in the mortal realm, which she does with unusual frequency. When battle breaks out-or if she has a reason to remind her followers to fear her—Lolth's lower body transforms into that of a huge demonic spider, whose spike—tipped legs and mandibles tear foes apart.": "当Lolth在凡间向她的追随者显现时，她会以一个轻盈的、傲慢的乌鸦族族长的形象出现，她这样做的频率不一般。当战斗爆发时，或者如果她有理由提醒她的追随者害怕她的话，洛尔思的下半身就会变成一只巨大的恶魔蜘蛛，其带刺的腿和下颚会将敌人撕碎。",
	"Known as the Demon Prince of Undeath and the Blood Lord, the demon lord Orcus is worshiped by the undead and by living creatures that channel the power of undeath. A brooding and nihilistic entity, Orcus yearns to make the multiverse a place of death and darkness, forever unchanging except by his will.": "恶魔领主奥卡斯（Orcus）被称为 \"不死的恶魔王子 \"和 \"血之领主\"，受到不死人和引导不死之力的生物的崇拜。奥库斯是一个忧郁和虚无主义的实体，他渴望让多元宇宙成为一个死亡和黑暗的地方，除了他的意志之外永远不会改变。",
	"The Demon Prince of Undeath is a foul and corpulent creature, with a humanoid torso, powerful goat legs, and the desiccated head of a ram. His sore-ridden body stinks of disease, but his decaying head and glowing red eyes are as a creature already dead. Great black bat wings sprout from his back, stirring reeking air as he moves.": "不死的恶魔王子是一个肮脏而腐烂的生物，有一个人形的躯干，有力的山羊腿，和一个干瘪的公羊头。他疮痍满目的身体散发着疾病的恶臭，但他腐烂的头颅和发红的眼睛就像一个已经死去的生物。巨大的黑色蝙蝠翅膀从他的背上长出，随着他的移动搅动着发臭的空气。",
	"Orcus wields a malevolent artifact known as the Wand of Orcus, a mace-like rod of obsidian topped by a humanoid skull. He surrounds himself with undead, and living creatures not under his control are anathema to him.": "半兽人挥舞着被称为 \"半兽人魔杖 \"的邪恶神器，这是一根黑曜石制成的魔杖，上面有一个人形的头骨。他的周围都是亡灵，不受他控制的生物对他来说是致命的。",
	"Known as the Gnoll Lord and the Beast of Butchery, the demon lord Yeenoghu hungers for slaughter and senseless destruction. Gnolls are his mortal instruments, and he drives them to ever-greater atrocities in his name.

	"Yeenoghu appears as a huge, scarred gnoll with a spiky crest of black spines, and eyes that burn with emerald flame. His armor is a patchwork of shields and breastplates claimed from fallen foes, and decorated by those foes' flayed skins. Yeenoghu can summon a triple flail he calls the Butcher, which he wields to deadly effect or wills to fly independently into battle as he tears foes apart with teeth and claws.": "耶诺古是一个巨大的、有疤痕的地精，他有一个由黑色刺组成的尖顶，眼睛里燃烧着翡翠般的火焰。他的盔甲是由倒下的敌人的盾牌和胸甲拼凑而成，并以这些敌人的剥皮作为装饰。耶诺古可以召唤出一把他称之为屠夫的三连枷，他挥舞着这把三连枷以达到致命的效果，或者当他用牙齿和爪子把敌人撕碎时，他的意志会独立飞向战场。",
	"No one knows the full number of demon lords that rage in the Abyss. Given the infinite depths of that plane, powerful demons constantly rise to become demon lords, then fall almost as quickly. Among the demon lords whose power has endured long enough for demonologists to name them are Fraz-Urb'luu, the Prince of Deception; Kostchtchie, the Prince of Wrath; Pazuzu, Prince of the Lower Aerial Kingdoms; and Zuggtmoy, Lady of Fungi.": "没有人知道在深渊中肆虐的恶魔领主的全部数量。鉴于深渊的无限深度，强大的恶魔不断崛起，成为恶魔领主，然后几乎同样迅速地堕落。在恶魔领主中，其力量已经持续了足够长的时间，以至于恶魔学家都能说出他们的名字，其中包括欺骗王子Fraz-Urb'luu；愤怒王子Kostchtchie；下层空中王国的王子Pazuzu；以及真菌夫人Zuggtmoy。",
	"Demonologists organize the chaotic distribution of demons into broad categories of power known as types.

Demons outside the six main types are categorized as minor demons and demon lords.": "恶魔学家将恶魔的混乱分布组织成被称为类型的广泛力量类别。大多数恶魔都属于六种主要类型之一，最弱的被归类为第一类型，最强的为第六类型。六种主要类型之外的恶魔被归类为小恶魔和恶魔领主。",

	"An angel slays evil creatures without remorse. As the embodiment of law and good, an angel is almost never mistaken in its judgments. This quality can create a sense of superiority in an angel, a sense that comes to the fore when an angel's task conflicts with the goals of another creature. The angel never acquiesces or gives way. When an angel is sent to aid mortals, it is sent not to serve but to command. The gods of good therefore send their angels among mortals only in response to the most dire circumstances.": "天使杀戮邪恶的生物而无怨无悔。作为法律和善的化身，天使的判断几乎从不出错。这种品质会在天使身上产生一种优越感，当天使的任务与其他生物的目标发生冲突时，这种感觉就会凸显出来。天使从不默许或让步。当一个天使被派来帮助凡人时，它不是被派来服务，而是被派来指挥。因此，善神只在最可怕的情况下才派他们的天使到凡人中间。",
	"An angel's moral compass grants it a sense of infallibility that can sometimes spell its undoing. Angels are usually too wise to fall for a simple deception, but sometimes pride can lead one to commit an evil act. Whether intentional or accidental, such an act is a permanent stain that marks the angel as an outcast. Fallen angels retain their power but lose their connection to the deities from which they were made. Most fallen angels take their banishment personally, rebelling against the powers they served by seeking rulership over a section of the Abyss or a place among other fallen in the hierarchy of the Nine Hells. Zariel, the ruler of the first layer of the Nine Hells, is such a creature. Rather than rebel, some fallen angels resign themselves to an isolated existence on the Material Plane, living in disguise as simple hermits.

Its hair and eyes gleam with an unearthly luster, and large feathery wings unfurl from its shoulder blades.": "传说中，天使常年以凡人的形态出现，向心地善良的人们提供帮助、希望和勇气。魔法师可以变成任何形状，尽管它更喜欢以无害的人形或动物形出现在凡人面前。当情况需要它卸下伪装时，魔王是一个美丽的人形生物，拥有银色的皮肤。它的头发和眼睛闪烁着不食人间烟火的光泽，巨大的羽毛状翅膀从肩胛骨上展开。",
	"Devils personify tyranny, with a totalitarian society dedicated to the domination of mortal life. The shadow of the Nine Hells of Baator extends far across the multiverse, and Asmodeus, the dark lord of Nessus, strives to subjugate the cosmos to satisfy his thirst for power.

They take perverse delight in exercising authority over the weak, and any creature that defies the authority of a devil faces swift and cruel punishment.

	"Devils understand the failings that plague intelligent mortals, and they use that knowledge to lead mortals into temptation and darkness, turning creatures into slaves to their own corruption. Devils on the Material Plane use their influence to manipulate humanoid rulers, whispering evil thoughts, fomenting paranoia, and eventually driving them to tyrannical actions.": "魔鬼了解困扰聪明的凡人的缺点，他们利用这些知识把凡人引向诱惑和黑暗，把生物变成他们自己腐败的奴隶。物质世界的魔鬼利用他们的影响力来操纵人形统治者，低声说着邪恶的想法，煽动偏执，并最终促使他们采取暴虐的行动。",
	"In accordance with their lawful alignment, devils obey even when they envy or dislike their superiors, knowing that their obedience will be rewarded. The hierarchy of the Nine Hells depends on this unswerving loyalty, without which that fiendish plane would become as anarchic as the Abyss.": "根据他们合法的结盟，魔鬼们即使在嫉妒或不喜欢他们的上司时也会服从，因为他们知道他们的服从会得到回报。九层地狱的等级制度依赖于这种坚定不移的忠诚，如果没有这种忠诚，这个恶魔的世界将变得像深渊一样无政府。",
	"At the same time, it is in the nature of devils to scheme, creating in some a desire to rule that eclipses their contentment to be ruled. This singular ambition is strongest among the archdevils whom Asmodeus appoints to rule the nine layers of the Nine Hells. These high-ranking fiends are the only devils to ever sample true power, which they crave like the sweetest ambrosia.": "同时，魔鬼的天性是谋划，在一些人身上产生了统治的欲望，使他们对被统治的满足感黯然失色。这种独特的野心在阿斯莫德任命的统治九层地狱的大魔鬼中最为强烈。这些高级恶魔是唯一能品尝到真正权力的恶魔，他们对权力的渴望就像最甜美的安眠药。",
	"Devils are confined to the Lower Planes, but they can travel beyond those planes by way of portals or powerful summoning magic. They love to strike bargains with mortals seeking to gain some benefit or prize, but a mortal making such a bargain must be wary. Devils are crafty negotiators and positively ruthless at enforcing the terms of an agreement. Moreover, a contract with even the lowliest devil is enforced by Asmodeus's will. Any mortal creature that breaks such a contract instantly forfeits its soul, which is spirited away to the Nine Hells.": "魔鬼被限制在下层世界，但他们可以通过传送门或强大的召唤魔法来超越这些世界。他们喜欢与凡人讨价还价，以获得一些利益或奖品，但凡人在进行这种讨价还价时必须保持警惕。魔鬼是狡猾的谈判者，在执行协议的条款方面非常无情。此外，即使是与最低级的魔鬼签订的合同，也会被阿斯莫德的意志所强制执行。任何破坏这种契约的凡人生物都会立即丧失其灵魂，并被送入九层地狱。",
	"To own a creature's soul is to have absolute control over that creature, and most devils accept no other currency in exchange for the fiendish power and boons they can provide. A soul is usually forfeited when a mortal dies naturally, for devils are immortal and can wait years for a contract to play out. If a contract allows a devil to claim a mortal's soul before death, it can instantly return to the Nine Hells with the soul in its possession. Only divine intervention can release a soul after a devil has claimed it.": "拥有一个生物的灵魂就是对该生物的绝对控制，大多数魔鬼不接受其他货币来换取他们所能提供的恶魔般的力量和恩惠。灵魂通常在凡人自然死亡时被没收，因为魔鬼是不死之身，可以等待多年后合同的履行。如果契约允许魔鬼在死前索要凡人的灵魂，它可以立即带着灵魂返回九层地狱。只有神的干预才能在恶魔索取灵魂后释放它。",
	"The Nine Hells has a rigid hierarchy that defines every aspect of its society. Asmodeus is the supreme ruler of all devils, and the only creature in the Nine Hells with the powers of a lesser god. Worshiped as such in the Material Plane, Asmodeus inspires the evil humanoid cults that take his name. In the Nine Hells, he commands scores of pit fiend generals, which in turn command legions of subordinates.": "九层地狱有一个严格的等级制度，规定了其社会的各个方面。阿斯莫德是所有魔鬼的最高统治者，也是九幽地狱中唯一拥有低等神力的生物。在物质世界中，阿斯莫德被作为崇拜对象，他激励着以他的名字命名的邪恶人形邪教。在九层地狱中，他指挥着几十个坑道恶魔将军，而这些将军又指挥着下属的军团。",
	"A supreme tyrant, a brilliant deceiver, and a master of subtlety, Asmodeus protects his throne by keeping his friends close and his enemies closer.

	"The lowest form of devil, lemures are the twisted and tormented souls of evil and corrupted mortals. A lemure killed in the Nine Hells is only permanently destroyed if it is killed with a blessed weapon or if its shapeless corpse is splashed with holy water before it can return to life.": "恶魔的最低形式，是邪恶和堕落的凡人的扭曲和折磨的灵魂。在九层地狱中被杀死的妖怪只有在用受祝福的武器杀死时才会被永久消灭，或者在其无形状的尸体被泼上圣水后才会恢复生命。",
	"When the soul of an evil mortal sinks into the Nine Hells, it takes on the physical form of a wretched lemure. Archdevils and greater devils have the power to promote lemures to lesser devils. Archdevils can promote lesser devils to greater devils, and Asmodeus alone can promote a greater devil to archdevil status. This diabolic promotion invokes a brief, painful transformation, with the devil's memories passing intact from one form to the next.": "当一个邪恶的凡人的灵魂沉入九层地狱时，它就会变成一个可恶的雷姆的物理形态。大魔王和大魔王有能力将雷姆晋升为小魔王。大恶魔可以将小恶魔提升为大恶魔，而阿斯莫德单独可以将大恶魔提升为大恶魔。这种邪恶的晋升会带来短暂而痛苦的转变，魔鬼的记忆会从一种形态完整地传递到另一种形态。",
	"Low-level promotions are typically based on need, such as when a pit fiend transforms lemures into imps to gain invisible spies under its command. High-level promotions are almost always based on merit, such as when a bone devil that distinguishes itself in battle is transformed into a horned devil by the archdevil it serves. A devil is seldom promoted more than one step at a time in the hierarchy of infernal forms.": "低级别的晋升通常是基于需要，例如，当一个坑道魔王将雷姆雷特转化为小恶魔以获得其麾下的隐形间谍。高级别的晋升几乎总是基于功绩，例如当一个在战斗中表现突出的骨魔被它所服务的大魔王转化为角魔时。在地狱形态的等级制度中，一个魔鬼的晋升很少超过一个级别。",
	"Demotion is the customary punishment for failure or disobedience among the devils. Archdevils or greater devils can demote a lesser devil to a lemure, which loses all memory of its prior existence. An archdevil can demote a greater devil to lesser devil status, but the demoted devil retains its memories-and might seek vengeance if the severity of the demotion is excessive.": "降级是魔鬼们对失败或不服从的习惯性惩罚。大魔王或大魔王可以将小魔王降为雷姆，而小魔王则失去了对其先前存在的所有记忆。大魔王可以将一个大魔王降为小魔王，但被降级的魔王会保留其记忆--如果降级的严重程度过高，可能会寻求报复。",
	"No devil can promote or demote another devil that has not sworn fealty to it, preventing rival archdevils from demoting each other's most powerful servants. Since all devils swear fealty to Asmodeus, he can freely demote any other devil, transforming it into whatever infernal form he desires.": "没有一个魔鬼可以提升或降级另一个没有向其宣誓效忠的魔鬼，这就防止了敌对的大魔鬼互相降级对方最强大的仆人。由于所有的魔鬼都向阿斯莫德宣誓效忠，他可以自由地将任何其他魔鬼降级，将其转化为他想要的任何地狱形态。",

	"Displacer beasts roamed the twilight lands of the Feywild for ages, until they were captured and trained by the Unseelie Court. The warriors of the court selectively bred the beasts to reinforce their ferocious and predatory nature, using them to hunt unicorns, pegasi, and other wondrous prey. However, it didn't take long for the displacer beasts to use their malevolent intelligence to escape their masters.": "驱逐兽在仙界的黄昏之地游荡了很久，直到它们被Unseelie Court捕获并训练。宫廷的勇士们有选择地培育这些野兽，以加强它们的凶猛和掠夺性，用它们来猎杀独角兽、小马和其他奇妙的猎物。然而，没过多久，流离失所的野兽就利用它们恶意的智慧逃离了它们的主人。",

Packs of displacer beasts hunting near trade roads recall the frequency and schedule of regular caravans, laying down ambushes to pick off those caravans.": "驱逐兽单独狩猎，或以小群为单位，表现出设置伏击的技能。单一的野兽会出击并撤退，把猎物引到密林中，让它的伙伴们等待。在贸易道路附近狩猎的流离兽群会回忆起定期商队的频率和时间表，并埋下伏笔，挑起这些商队。",

	"Djinn are known for their sense of mischief and their favorable attitude toward mortals. Among genies, djinn deal coolly with efreet and marids, whom they view as haughty. They openly despise dao and strike against them with little provocation.": "精灵以其恶作剧的意识和对凡人的友好态度而闻名。在精灵中，精灵与伊夫里特和马利德打交道很冷静，他们认为他们是傲慢的。他们公开鄙视道，并在没有任何挑衅的情况下对他们进行打击。",
	"Masters of the air, the djinn ride powerful whirlwinds that they create and direct on a whim, and which can even carry passengers. Creatures that stand against a djinni are assaulted by wind and thunder, even as the djinni spins away on that wind if outmatched in combat. When a djinni flies, its lower body transforms into a column of swirling air.": "空气的主人，精灵驾驭着强大的旋风，他们随心所欲地创造和指挥，甚至可以携带乘客。与精灵对抗的生物会受到风和雷的攻击，即使在战斗中不敌，精灵也会在风中旋转而去。当一个精灵飞起来的时候，它的下半身会变成一个旋转的空气柱。",
	"The djinn believe that servitude is a matter of fate, and that no being can contest the hand of fate. As a result, of all the genies, djinn are the ones most amenable to servitude, though they never enjoy it. Djinn treat their slaves more like servants deserving of kindness and protection, and they part with them reluctantly.": "精灵相信，奴役是命运的问题，没有人可以与命运之手抗衡。因此，在所有的精灵中，精灵是最容易接受奴役的，尽管他们从不享受这种奴役。精灵对待他们的奴隶更像是值得善待和保护的仆人，他们不情愿地与他们分开。",
	"A mortal who desires the brief service of a djinni can entreat it with fine gifts, or use flattery to bribe it into compliance. Powerful wizards are able to forgo such niceties, however, if they can summon, bind into service, or imprison a djinni using magic. Long-term service displeases a djinni, and imprisonment is inexcusable. Djinn resent the cruel wizards that have imprisoned their kind in bottles, iron flasks, and wind instruments throughout the ages. Betrayal, particularly by a mortal whom a djinni trusted, is a vile deed that only deadly vengeance can amend.": "一个凡人如果想得到精灵的短暂服务，可以用精美的礼物来恳求它，或者用奉承来贿赂它，让它服从。然而，强大的巫师能够放弃这些礼节，如果他们能够用魔法召唤、捆绑或囚禁一个精灵。长期的服务会让精灵不高兴，而监禁是不可原谅的。精灵憎恨那些残酷的巫师，他们把他们的同类囚禁在瓶子、铁瓶和历代的管乐器中。背叛，尤其是被精灵信任的凡人背叛，是一种卑劣的行为，只有致命的复仇才能修正。",

	"A doppelganger's adopted form allows it to blend into almost any group or community, but its transformation doesn't impart languages, mannerisms, memory, or personality. Doppelgangers often follow or capture creatures they intend to impersonate, studying them and probing their minds for secrets. A doppelganger can read a creature's surface thoughts, allowing it to glean that creature's name, desires, and fears, along with a few scattered memories. A doppelganger impersonating a specific creature as part of a long-term plot might keep its double alive and close at hand for weeks, probing the victim's mind daily to learn how to behave and speak authentically.": "二重身采用的形式使它能够融入几乎所有的团体或社区，但它的转变并没有传授语言、举止、记忆或个性。二重身经常跟踪或捕捉他们打算冒充的生物，研究他们并探测他们的思想，寻找秘密。二重身可以读取一个生物的表面思想，让它能够收集到这个生物的名字、欲望和恐惧，以及一些零散的记忆。作为长期阴谋的一部分，冒充特定生物的二重身可能会让它的替身活着，并在附近停留数周，每天探查受害者的思想，学习如何表现和真实地说话。",
	"Doppelgangers work alone or in small groups, with group roles shifting from con to con.

	"A dragon turtle is smart enough to be bribed, and pirates sailing seas patrolled by these creatures quickly learn to offer them treasure in exchange for safe passage. Clever sahuagin sometimes ally with dragon turtles, enticing them with treasure to use their blistering breath weapons in sahuagin raids against ships and coastal settlements.": "龙龟很聪明，可以被收买，在这些生物巡逻的海域航行的海盗们很快就学会了用财宝来换取安全通行。聪明的萨瓦金人有时会与龙龟结盟，用财宝引诱它们在萨瓦金人对船只和沿海定居点的突袭中使用它们喷发的呼吸武器。",

They are the destined rulers of the darkness, and when Lolth commands them to rise up and destroy their surface-dwelling kin, they will.": "鸦人崇拜洛尔思，一个居住在深渊的神灵。她被称为蜘蛛女王或蜘蛛妖后，是黑暗精灵围绕其建立地下文明的人物。她要求什么，乌鸦就做什么。作为最邪恶的精灵，乌鸦很少被地面世界看到。虽然他们阴谋摧毁放逐他们的精灵，但他们不再把自己看作是流亡者。他们是注定的黑暗统治者，当洛尔兹命令他们起来摧毁他们在地面上居住的亲属时，他们会这样做。",
	"The drow have lived underground for so long that they have evolved to their surroundings and can see in the dark. However, they can no longer stand sunlight. When slaves are in short supply in the Underdark, the drow send raiding parties to the surface to capture humanoids under cover of darkness, bringing them back to their cities to be tortured into submission. Beyond those occasional excursions, the drow are content to remain in their subterranean realm, where they feel secure and in control.": "乌鸦在地下生活了这么久，他们已经适应了周围的环境，可以在黑暗中看到东西。然而，他们再也无法忍受阳光了。当地下世界的奴隶供应不足时，乌鸦会派出突击队到地表，在黑暗的掩护下抓捕人类，把他们带回他们的城市，让他们受尽折磨。除了这些偶尔的远行，乌鸦满足于呆在他们的地下世界，在那里他们感到安全和控制。",
	"The dark elves build fantastic cities in enormous caverns where food and water are abundant. Their ability to sculpt stone rivals that of the greatest dwarf artisans, yet their structures retain a decidedly elven aesthetic. Though appearing delicate, drow settlements are structurally sound and remarkably resilient. The drow like to hollow out enormous stalagmites and stalactites, creating populated spires that rise from the floors and ceilings. A drow city is a sprawling metropolis enclosed by high walls. Non-drow visitors must conduct their business outside the walls under watchful eyes. The drow raise and keep giant spiders to help protect their cities against intruders, even as they drape those cities in beautiful webbing, creating a gossamer snare to catch flying enemies that would otherwise soar over the walls.": "黑暗精灵在食物和水充足的巨大洞穴中建造梦幻般的城市。他们雕刻石头的能力可与最伟大的矮人工匠相媲美，但他们的结构却保留了明显的精灵美学。虽然看起来很精致，但鸦人的定居点结构健全，而且具有非凡的弹性。乌鸦喜欢挖空巨大的石笋和钟乳石，创造出人口众多的尖顶，从地板和天花板升起。乌鸦的城市是一个由高墙围起来的广阔的大都市。非乌鸦的游客必须在墙外的监视下进行他们的业务。鸦人饲养巨型蜘蛛，以帮助保护他们的城市免受入侵者的侵扰，即使他们用美丽的网状物覆盖这些城市，创造出一个格桑花的陷阱来捕捉飞翔的敌人，否则他们就会飞越墙壁。",
	"Just as the drow have adapted to underground life, so too has their magic. In addition to using that magic to carve their cities from stone, they empower their weapons, create dangerous new magic items, and summon demons from the Abyss. Drow spellcasters are supremely arrogant and never hesitate to use their magic in the most abhorrent ways.": "正如乌鸦已经适应了地下生活，他们的魔法也是如此。除了用这种魔法从石头上雕刻出他们的城市外，他们还赋予武器力量，创造出危险的新魔法物品，并从深渊中召唤出恶魔。乌鸦的施法者是极其傲慢的，他们毫不犹豫地以最令人厌恶的方式使用他们的魔法。",
	"Drow craft weapons made of adamantine, a dark and supernaturally hard metal. Drow artisans adorn their weapons and armor with web-like filigree and spider motifs, and mages sometimes imbue items with magic to enhance their effectiveness. However, such magic fades when exposed to sunlight, so that magical drow weapons and armor rarely retain their enhancement bonuses and magical properties when brought to the surface.": "鸦人用金刚砂制作武器，这是一种黑暗和超自然的硬金属。乌鸦工匠们用网状的花纹和蜘蛛图案来装饰他们的武器和盔甲，法师们有时会给物品注入魔法以增强它们的效力。然而，这种魔力在暴露于阳光下时就会消失，所以魔法鸦人的武器和盔甲在被带到地面时很少能保留它们的强化效果和魔法属性。",
	"Drow politics are cutthroat and rife with intrigue. When drow work together, it is typically to destroy a common foe and ensure their own survival, and such alliances are short lived and fraught with peril.": "鸦人的政治是残酷的，充满了阴谋。当鸦人合作时，通常是为了消灭一个共同的敌人并确保他们自己的生存，这样的联盟是短暂的，充满危险的。",
	"Drow society is divided into noble houses, each ruled by a matron who seeks to raise the prestige and power of her house above all others. Other high-ranking members of the house are blood relatives, while the middling ranks are flush with drow from weaker families that have sworn fealty to the greater house. Clinging precariously to the bottom rung of a house's social ladder are the house slaves, made up of drow of low birth and the occasional non-drow captive.": "鸦人社会分为多个贵族家族，每个家族都由一位女主人统治，她试图提高自己家族的声望和权力，使其凌驾于所有其他家族之上。家族中的其他高级成员都有血缘关系，而中层则是来自弱小家族、发誓效忠于大家族的鸦人。在一个家族的社会阶梯的最底层岌岌可危的是家族奴隶，由出身低微的乌鸦和偶尔的非乌鸦俘虏组成。",
	"Lolth, through her faithful priestesses, dictates the rules of drow society, ensuring that her orders and plots are carried out. Since Lolth is prone to manifesting on the Material Plane and directly punishing those that disobey her, the drow have learned to heed what she says and do as her priestesses command.": "洛尔思，通过她忠实的女祭司，支配着乌鸦社会的规则，确保她的命令和阴谋得到执行。由于洛尔思很容易在物质世界显现，并直接惩罚那些不服从她的人，所以乌鸦已经学会听从她的话，并按照她的女祭司的命令行事。",
	"In drow society, males are subservient to females. A male drow might lead an Underdark patrol or a raiding party to the surface, but he reports to a female drow-either the matron of his house or one of her hand-picked female subordinates. Although male drow can fill almost any function in drow society, they can't be priests, nor can they rule a house.": "在乌鸦社会中，男性对女性是顺从的。一个男性乌鸦可能会带领地下城的巡逻队或突击队到地面，但他要向女性乌鸦报告--要么是他家族的女主人，要么是她亲自挑选的女性下属之一。尽管男性乌鸦可以担任乌鸦社会中的几乎任何职务，但他们不能成为祭司，也不能统治一个家族。",
	"Distilled from spider venom and the flora of the Underdark, poison can be found in abundance among the drow, and it plays an important part in their culture and politics. Drow mages concoct a viscid toxin that leaves enemies {@condition unconscious}. Drow warriors coat their blades and crossbow bolts with this venom, looking forward to the interrogation and torture that follows combat.": "从蜘蛛毒液和地下城的植物中提炼出来的毒药，在鸦人中可以找到很多，而且在他们的文化和政治中起着重要作用。鸦人法师炼制出一种粘稠的毒素，让敌人（%0%）。乌鸦战士用这种毒液涂抹他们的刀片和弩箭，期待着战斗之后的审讯和折磨。",
	"Drow often wear magic armor and carry magic weapons that lose their enhancement bonuses permanently if they are exposed to sunlight for 1 hour or longer.": "鸦人经常穿戴魔法盔甲和携带魔法武器，如果暴露在阳光下1小时或更长时间，就会永久性地失去增强的奖励。",
	"A drow wearing a +1 chain shirt and carrying a +1 shortsword has AC 16 and a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with shortsword attacks.": "一个身穿+1链子衬衫并携带+1短剑的乌鸦有16级攻击力，在短剑的攻击和伤害卷上有+1的加成。",

	"Such priestesses execute the will of the Spider Queen, and as a result, they wield tremendous power and influence in drow society. The matron mothers who rule the drow houses are the most powerful of Lolth's priestesses, but they must constantly balance their devotion to the Spider Queen with their devotion to their families.": "这些女祭司执行蜘蛛女王的意志，因此，她们在乌鸦社会中拥有巨大的权力和影响力。统治乌鸦家族的母亲是洛尔思最强大的女祭司，但她们必须不断平衡对蜘蛛女王的奉献和对家庭的奉献。",
	"Druids dwell in forests and other secluded wilderness locations, where they protect the natural world from monsters and the encroachment of civilization. Some are tribal shamans who heal the sick, pray to animal spirits, and provide spiritual guidance.": "德鲁伊居住在森林和其他僻静的荒野中，他们在那里保护自然界不受怪物和文明的侵袭。有些是部落的巫师，他们为病人治病，向动物的灵魂祈祷，并提供精神指导。",
	"Travelers entering a forest might catch a glimpse of a feminine form flitting through the trees. Warm laughter hangs on the air, drawing those who hear it deeper into the emerald shadows.": "进入森林的旅行者可能会瞥见一个女性的身影在树丛中闪过。空气中弥漫着温暖的笑声，吸引着那些听到笑声的人深入到翡翠的阴影中。",
	"Powerful fey will sometimes bind lesser fey spirits to trees, transforming them into dryads. This is sometimes done as a punishment when the fey spirit falls in love with a mortal and that love is forbidden.": "强大的费伊人有时会把较小的费伊人的灵魂绑在树上，把他们变成干尸。这有时是作为一种惩罚，当精灵爱上一个凡人而这种爱是被禁止的。",
	"A dryad can emerge from the tree and travel the lands around it, but the tree remains her home and roots her to the world. As long as the tree remains healthy and unharmed, the dryad stays forever youthful and alluring. If the tree is harmed, she suffers. If the tree is ever destroyed, the dryad descends into madness.": "干尸可以从树中出来，并在它周围的土地上旅行，但树仍然是她的家，并使她扎根于世界。只要树保持健康和不受伤害，干尸就会永远保持年轻和诱人的状态。如果树受到伤害，她就会受苦。如果这棵树被毁，干尸就会陷入疯狂。",
	"Dryads act as guardians of their woodland demesnes. Shy and reclusive, they watch interlopers from the trees. A dryad struck by the beauty of a stranger might investigate more closely, perhaps even try to lure the individual away to be {@condition charmed}.": "乾坤大挪移是其林地领地的守护者。他们害羞而隐蔽，在树上观察入侵者。被陌生人的美貌所打动的干尸可能会更仔细地调查，也许甚至试图引诱这个人离开。",
	"Dryads work with other sylvan creatures to defend their forests. Unicorns, treants, and satyrs live alongside them, in addition to druids that share the dryads' devotion to the woods they call home.": "干尸与其他森林生物一起工作，以保卫他们的森林。独角兽、树人和萨提尔与他们一起生活，此外还有德鲁伊，他们与干尸一样对他们称之为家的森林有奉献精神。",
	"Dryads can speak with plants and animals. They can teleport from one tree to another, luring interlopers away from their groves. If pressed, a dryad can beguile humanoids with her enchantments, turning enemies into friends. They also know a handful of useful spells.": "Dryads可以与植物和动物对话。他们可以从一棵树传送到另一棵树，把入侵者从他们的丛林中引开。如果被逼急了，干尸可以用她的魔法诱导人类，化敌为友。他们还知道一些有用的法术。",
	"The tyrannical duergar, also known as gray dwarves, dwell in fantastic cities deep in the Underdark. Using ancient dwarven knowledge and myriad slaves, they work tirelessly to expand their subterranean kingdoms.": "暴虐的duergar，也被称为灰矮人，居住在地下世界深处的奇妙城市。他们利用古老的矮人知识和无数的奴隶，孜孜不倦地扩展他们的地下王国。",

	"The duergar were once dwarves, before their greed and endless delving beneath the earth brought them into contact with the mind flayers. Held in captivity for generations by the illithids, the dwarves eventually won their independence with the aid of the evil god Laduguer. Slavery had forever changed them, however, darkening their spirits to make the duergar as evil as the tyrants they had escaped. Despite winning their freedom, duergar are dour, pessimistic, untrusting creatures, always toiling and complaining, with no memory of what it means to be happy or proud. Their craftsmanship and accomplishments endure, yet they are bereft of warmth or artistry.": "杜尔加人曾经是矮人，在他们的贪婪和在地底无休止的探索使他们接触到了心灵传播者。矮人被illithids囚禁了数代，最终在邪神Laduguer的帮助下赢得了独立。然而，奴役永远地改变了他们，使他们的精神变得黑暗，使duergar和他们所逃离的暴君一样邪恶。尽管赢得了自由，但duergar是沉闷、悲观、不信任的生物，总是在劳作和抱怨，对快乐或自豪意味着什么没有记忆。他们的手艺和成就经久不衰，但他们却缺乏温暖或艺术性。",
	"Duergar make war against their dwarven kin and all other subterranean races. They forge alliances when it is convenient, then break those alliances when they have nothing more to gain. They take and hold slaves to toil in the Underdark, regarding them as free labor and crude currency.": "杜尔加人对他们的矮人亲属和所有其他地下种族发动战争。他们在方便的时候结成联盟，然后在他们没有更多的利益时打破这些联盟。他们掳掠并扣留奴隶在地下世界劳作，将他们视为免费劳动力和粗劣的货币。",
	"Like dwarves, duergar have strong constitutions. Adding to their physical stamina is an incredible mental fortitude resulting from their time as slaves of the illithids. A duergar's mind is a fortress, able to shrug off charms, illusions, and other spells.": "与矮人一样，杜尔加人有强健的体魄。除了身体上的耐力之外，他们还具有令人难以置信的精神毅力，这是由于他们曾是伊里希德人的奴隶。杜尔加人的头脑是一座堡垒，能够抵御符咒、幻术和其他法术。",
	"The Underdark is saturated with strange magical power, which the duergar absorbed over generations of imprisonment. A duergar can increase its size and strength for a short time, becoming a powerful ogre-sized warrior. If it faces a foe it can't fight, or when spying on creatures approaching its territory, it can just as easily become {@condition invisible} to slip away into the darkness. Eons spent in the Underdark also sharpened their {@sense darkvision}, allowing them to see twice as far as other dwarves. This keen eyesight comes at a cost, however, as a duergar's vision is compromised by sunlight.": "暗黑世界充满了奇怪的魔力，这些魔力是杜尔加在几代人的监禁中吸收的。一个duergar可以在短时间内增加它的大小和力量，成为一个强大的食人魔大小的战士。如果它面对的是它无法对抗的敌人，或者在监视接近其领地的生物时，它也可以很容易地变成（%0%），溜进黑暗中。在暗黑中度过的岁月也磨砺了它们的（%1%），使它们的视力比其他矮人高出一倍。然而，这种敏锐的视力是有代价的，因为杜尔加人的视力会受到阳光的影响。",
	"Asmodeus, Lord of the Nine Hells, has been known to impersonate duergar gods in order to cultivate the evil brimming in the hearts of the gray dwarves.

	" Under the direction of their leader, Primus, modrons increase order in the multiverse in accordance with laws beyond the comprehension of mortal minds. Their own minds are networked in a hierarchal pyramid, in which each modron receives commands from superiors and delegates orders to underlings. A modron carries out commands with total obedience, utmost efficiency, and an absence of morality or ego. Modrons have no sense of self beyond what is necessary to fulfill their duties. They exist as a unified collective, divided by ranks, yet they always refer to themselves collectively. To a modron, there is no \"I,\" but only \"we\" or \"us.\"": " 在他们的领袖Primus的指导下，modrons按照凡人的思维所不能理解的法则来增加多元宇宙的秩序。他们自己的思想在一个层次分明的金字塔中联网，其中每个模子接受上级的命令，并将命令委托给下级。莫德隆以完全的服从、最高的效率和没有道德或自我的方式执行命令。除了履行职责所必需的东西，莫德隆人没有自我意识。他们作为一个统一的集体存在，按等级划分，但他们总是集体地指称自己。对摩登人来说，没有 \"我\"，只有 \"我们 \"或 \"我们\"。",

	" If a modron is destroyed, its remains disintegrate. A replacement from the next lowest rank then transforms in a flash of light, gaining the physical form of its new rank. The promoted modron is replaced by one of its underlings in the same manner, all the way to the lowest levels of the hierarchy. There, a new modron is created by Primus, with a steady stream of monodrones leaving the Great Modron Cathedral on Mechanus as a result.": " 如果一个模子被摧毁，它的残骸就会瓦解。来自下一个最低等级的替代者会在一束光中变身，获得其新等级的物理形态。晋升的模子以同样的方式被它的一个下属取代，一直到等级制度的最低层。在那里，一个新的莫德隆被普利姆斯创造出来，源源不断的莫德隆人因此离开了麦肯纳斯的大莫德隆大教堂。",

It can also use its webbing to fashion elaborate snares and nets, which often festoon its lair.": "细密的丝线从Etercap腹部的腺体中流出，让它射出粘稠的网线来捆绑、诱捕或勒死其受害者。它还可以用它的网线来制作精致的陷阱和网，这些陷阱和网通常会在它的巢穴中出现。",
	"When travelers and explorers venture into an ettercap's territory, the ettercap stalks them. Some meet their end wandering blindly into traps or sections of forest enclosed by webs. Others, the ettercap garrotes with strands of web or envenoms with its poisonous bite.": "当旅行者和探险者冒险进入ETTERCAP的领地时，ETTERCAP会跟踪他们。有些人盲目地走入陷阱或被网围住的森林区域，最终遭遇了死亡。还有一些人，ettercap会用网绳套住他们，或用它的毒牙咬死他们。",
	"Though they dwell in the wilds, ettercaps have no desire to live in harmony with nature. A forest infested with ettercaps transforms into a gloomy place, choked with webs and infested with giant spiders, giant insects, and other sinister predators. Creatures that wander too far into such a wood are soon lost in a maze of webs that dangle with the bones and lost treasures of the ettercaps' victims.": "虽然他们居住在荒野中，但ettercaps并不希望与自然和谐相处。一个被ettercaps侵扰的森林会变成一个阴暗的地方，被网窒息，并有巨大的蜘蛛、巨型昆虫和其他险恶的掠食者出没。徘徊在这样的森林里太远的生物很快就会迷失在迷宫般的网络中，这些网络上挂着蚀心帽受害者的骨头和丢失的财宝。",
	"Ettercaps are natural enemies of fey creatures. The foul creatures set web snares to catch sprites and pixies, which they hungrily devour, and will encase a dryad's tree in webbing in a vain attempt to trap the dryad. Otherwise timid fey will sometimes approach outsiders for help in dealing with an ettercap infestation, being ill-equipped to deal with the malevolent creatures themselves.": "Ettercaps是精灵生物的天敌。这些肮脏的生物设置了网络陷阱来捕捉精灵和小精灵，它们饥肠辘辘地吞噬这些精灵和小精灵，并将干尸的树包裹在网络中，妄图困住干尸。否则，胆小的费伊人有时会向外人寻求帮助，以处理ettercap的侵扰，因为他们自己没有能力处理这种邪恶的生物。",
	"An ettin is a foul, two-headed giant with the crude characteristics of an orc. It never bathes if it can help it, and its thick skin is usually encrusted with a thick layer of dirt and grime beneath the stinking hides it wears. Its long stringy hair hangs in an unkempt mess about its faces, and its breath reeks from mouths filled with crooked teeth and tusks.": "艾丁是一种肮脏的双头巨人，具有兽人的粗劣特征。如果可以的话，它从不洗澡，而且它厚厚的皮肤通常在它所穿的臭皮囊下面包裹着一层厚厚的灰尘和污垢。它的长发杂乱无章地挂在脸上，它的呼吸从长满弯曲的牙齿和獠牙的嘴里发出恶臭。",
	"The twin heads of an ettin are two individuals trapped in the same brutish body. Each head has its own mind, personality, and name, and possesses unique preferences and quirks. Bound from birth, both minds only rarely experience privacy or solitude. This familiarity breeds contempt, and an ettin bullies and argues with itself constantly, its two heads each taking constant offense at the other's slights.": "艾丁的双头是被困在同一个粗暴身体里的两个人。每个脑袋都有自己的思想、个性和名字，并拥有独特的喜好和怪癖。从出生开始就被束缚，两个脑袋都很少经历隐私或孤独。这种熟悉感滋生了蔑视，一个艾丁人不断地欺负自己，与自己争吵，它的两个脑袋对另一个人的轻视不断冒犯。",
	"When other creatures refer to an ettin, they combine its double names to form a single compound name that applies to the creature as a whole. If an ettin has one head named Hargle and another named Vargle, other creatures call the ettin Harglevargle.": "当其他生物提到ETTEN时，他们会将它的双重名字结合起来，形成一个适用于该生物整体的复合名字。如果一个ETT有一个头叫Hargle，另一个叫Vargle，其他生物就称这个ETT为Harglevargle。",
	"As much as an ettin argues with itself, it is even less tolerant of other ettins, since a conversation between two ettins almost always amounts to a shouting match between a crowd of four belligerent heads. Most ettins are solitary creatures as a result, tolerating one another only to reproduce.": "就像ETTIN与自己争论一样，它对其他ETTIN的容忍度更低，因为两个ETTIN之间的对话几乎总是相当于四个好战的头颅之间的喊话。因此，大多数ETTIN是独居动物，相互容忍只是为了繁衍后代。",
	"An ettin's twin heads are always the same gender, with a body to match.": "一个人的双头总是相同的性别，有一个与之匹配的身体。",
	"Females are the dominant gender among ettins, and they initiate the ettins' mating rituals. After finding a suitable den, a female ettin hunts and conquers a male, which cares for and feeds her during her six-month pregnancy. Once the child is born, the male ettin is released from servitude. When the child is old enough to hunt for itself, the mother sends it away and abandons the den.": "雌性是ETTINS中的主导性别，它们发起ETTINS的交配仪式。在找到一个合适的巢穴后，雌性ETTIN猎取并征服雄性，雄性在她六个月的孕期中照顾并喂养她。一旦孩子出生，雄性ETT就会被释放，不再受人奴役。当孩子长大到可以自己狩猎时，母亲就会把它送走，并放弃这个巢穴。",
	"When focused on a mutually beneficial purpose or united by a common threat, an ettin can resolve its personality differences and dedicate itself fully to a task. An ettin fights with a weapon in each hand, making twin attacks directed by its respective heads. When an ettin sleeps, one of its heads remains ever alert, gaining its only moments of privacy and keeping two eyes open for any creature that disturbs its precious solitude.": "当专注于一个互利的目的或因共同的威胁而团结起来时，ETTEN可以解决其个性差异，并全身心地投入到一项任务中。ettin在战斗时，两只手都拿着武器，由其各自的头颅指挥进行双重攻击。当Etin睡觉时，它的一个头会一直保持警觉，获得仅有的隐私时刻，并睁大双眼寻找任何扰乱其宝贵孤独的生物。",
	"In ancient dialects of Common, the word \"ettin\" translates as \"ugly giant.\" Legends tell of orcs that once stumbled upon a temple to Demogorgon, the magic of which transformed them into giant mockeries of the twin-headed Prince of Demons. Driven to near madness, these creatures scattered into the wilderness to become the first ettins.": "在古代方言中，\"ETTIN \"这个词被翻译成 \"丑陋的巨人\"。传说中，兽人曾经偶然发现了德摩戈恩的神庙，神庙的魔法将他们变成了双头恶魔王子的巨大嘲讽。这些生物被逼得近乎疯狂，散落在荒野中，成为第一批埃廷人。",
	"Whatever the truth of the ettins' origin, orcs treat them as distant cousins, and orc tribes often entice ettins to serve as guards, scouts, and marauders. An ettin isn't particularly loyal to its orc handlers, but the orcs can win it over with the promise of food and loot.": "无论伊特丁的起源是什么，兽人都把它们当作远房表亲，兽人部落经常引诱伊特丁充当卫兵、侦察兵和掠夺者。兽人并不特别忠诚于其驯服者，但兽人可以用食物和战利品的承诺来赢得它。",

	"The only warning of a faerie dragon's presence is a stifled giggle. The dragon stays out of sight, watching invisibly as its victims contend with its pranks. When its fun is done, the dragon might reveal itself, depending on the disposition of its \"prey.\"": "小精灵龙出现的唯一警告是一声被扼杀的笑声。这条龙呆在看不见的地方，无形地看着它的受害者与它的恶作剧抗争。当它的乐趣结束时，龙可能会暴露自己，这取决于它的 \"猎物 \"的态度。",
	"A faerie dragon has a sharp mind, a fondness for treasure and good company, and a puckish sense of humor. Travelers can play to a faerie dragon's draconic nature by offering it \"treasure\" in the form of sweets, baked goods, and baubles in exchange for information or safe passage through its territory.": "法力龙有一个敏锐的头脑，喜欢财宝和好伙伴，还有一种狡猾的幽默感。旅行者可以通过提供糖果、烘烤食品和小玩意等形式的 \"宝物\"，以换取信息或安全通过它的领地，来发挥法力龙的龙性。",
	"A faerie dragon's scales change hue as it ages, moving through all the colors of the rainbow. All faerie dragons have innate spellcasting ability, gaining new spells as they mature.": "法力龙的鳞片会随着它的年龄增长而改变颜色，在彩虹的所有颜色中游走。所有的精灵龙都有与生俱来的法术能力，随着它们的成熟，会获得新的法术。",

	"Fire giant fortresses are built around and inside volcanoes or near magma-filled caverns. The blistering heat of their homes fuels the fire giants' forges, and causes the iron of their fortress walls to glow a comforting orange. In lands far removed from volcanic heat, fire giants mine coal to burn. Traditional smithies occupy places of honor in their demesnes, and the giants' stony fortresses constantly belch plumes of sooty smoke. In more remote outposts, fire giants burn wood to keep their forge fires lit, deforesting leagues of land in all directions.": "火巨人的堡垒建在火山周围和内部，或者靠近充满岩浆的洞穴。他们的家园所散发的热浪为火巨人的锻造提供了燃料，并使他们的堡垒墙体发出令人欣慰的橙色光芒。在远离火山热的地方，火巨人开采煤炭来燃烧。传统的铁匠铺在他们的领地里占据着荣誉的位置，而巨人的石质堡垒则不断地喷出烟尘的烟雾。在更偏远的前哨站，火巨人燃烧木材以保持他们的锻造火种，在各个方向上砍伐森林的土地。",

	"From birth, a fire giant is taught to embrace a legacy of war. At the cradle, its parents chant songs of battle. As children, fire giants play at war, hurling igneous rocks at one another across the banks of magma rivers. In later years, formal martial training becomes an integral part of life in the giants' fortresses and underground realms of smoke and ash.": "火巨人从出生起就被教导要接受战争的遗产。在摇篮里，它的父母高唱战斗之歌。在儿童时期，火巨人在战争中玩耍，在岩浆河两岸互相投掷火岩。到了晚年，正式的武术训练成为巨人的堡垒和地下烟尘领域生活的一个组成部分。",

	"Just as fire giants pass down their knowledge of crafting from generation to generation, their renowned fighting prowess comes not from wild fury but from endless discipline and training. Enemies make the mistake of underestimating fire giants based on their brutish manner, learning too late that these giants live for combat and can be shrewd tacticians.": "就像火巨人代代相传的工艺知识一样，他们著名的战斗力不是来自于狂暴的愤怒，而是来自于无尽的纪律和训练。敌人会因为火巨人的野蛮行为而错误地低估他们，但他们很晚才知道，这些巨人是为战斗而生的，可以成为精明的战术家。",

	"Fire giants have a fearsome reputation as soldiers and conquerors, and for their ability to burn, plunder, and destroy. Yet among the giants, fire giants produce the greatest crafters and artists.

	" The fire wreathing a flameskull burns continually, giving off bright light that the creature controls. It uses those flames as a weapon, focusing them to loose them as fiery rays from its eye sockets.": " 缠绕在火焰头颅上的火焰不断燃烧，散发出该生物所控制的亮光。它用这些火焰作为武器，将它们集中起来，从它的眼眶中释放出火热的光线。",

They hunt the wild game of the tundra and mountains but don't cook it, since meat from a fresh kill tastes sufficiently hot to their palate.": "冰霜巨人居住在高高的山峰和冰川裂缝中，冬天时太阳会把它的金色脑袋藏起来。在他们冰冻的家园里不生长农作物，除了在袭击文明土地时捕获的牲畜外，他们很少饲养牲畜。他们狩猎苔原和山区的野生动物，但不做饭，因为新鲜的肉对他们的味觉来说是足够热的。",
	"The war horns of the frost giants howl as they march from their ice fortresses and glacial rifts amid the howling blizzard. When that storm clears, villages and steadings lay in ruins, ravens descending to feed on the corpses of any creatures foolish or unlucky enough to stand in the giants' path.": "冰霜巨人的战争号角在呼啸的暴风雪中从他们的冰雪堡垒和冰川裂缝中行进时发出嚎叫。当暴风雪消散时，村庄和建筑都成了废墟，乌鸦降临，以任何愚蠢或不幸运地站在巨人道路上的生物的尸体为食。",
	"Inns and taverns suffer the brunt of the damage, their cellars gutted and their casks of ale and mead gone. Smithies are likewise toppled, their iron and steel claimed. Curiously undisturbed are the houses of moneylenders and wealthy citizens, for the reavers have little use for coins or baubles. Frost giants prize gems and jewelry large enough to be worn and noticed. However, even those treasures are most often saved for trading opportunities with other giants more adept at crafting metal weapons and armor.": "客栈和酒馆首当其冲受到破坏，他们的酒窖被挖空，一桶桶啤酒和蜂蜜酒不见了。铁匠铺也同样被推倒，他们的铁和钢被夺走。奇怪的是，放债人和富人的房子没有受到干扰，因为掠夺者对钱币或饰品没有什么用。霜巨人喜欢宝石和珠宝，大到可以佩戴和注意。然而，即使是这些宝物也常常被保存起来，以备与其他更擅长制作金属武器和盔甲的巨人进行交易。",
	"Frost giants respect brute strength above all else, and a frost giant's place in the ordning depends on evidence of physical might, such as superior musculature, scars from battles of renown, or trophies fashioned from the bodies of slain enemies. Tasks such as hunting, childrearing, and crafting are given to giants based on their physical strength and hardiness.": "冰霜巨人对蛮力的尊重高于一切，一个冰霜巨人在军团中的地位取决于身体力量的证明，比如卓越的肌肉组织、著名的战斗留下的伤疤，或者用被杀的敌人的尸体制成的战利品。狩猎、育儿和手工制作等任务是根据巨人的体力和耐力给予的。",
	"When frost giants of different clans meet and their status is unclear, they wrestle for dominance. Such meetings might resemble festivals where giants cheer on their champions, making bold boasts and challenges. At other times, the informal ceremony can become a chaotic free-for-all where both clans rush into a melee that fells trees, shatters the ice on frozen lakes, and causes avalanches on the snowy mountainsides.": "当不同部族的冰霜巨人相遇，而他们的地位又不明确时，他们就会为争夺统治权而搏斗。这种会议可能类似于节日，巨人们为他们的冠军欢呼，进行大胆的吹嘘和挑战。在其他时候，非正式的仪式可能会变成一场混乱的自由竞赛，两族都冲进混战中，砍伐树木，击碎冰湖上的冰块，并在雪山上引起雪崩。",
	"Though frost giants consider the menial crafting of goods beneath them, carving and leatherwork are valued skills. They make their clothing from the skins and bones of beasts, and carve bone or ivory into jewelry and the handles of weapons and tools. They reuse the weapons and armor of their smaller foes, stringing shields into scale armor and lashing sword blades to wooden hafts to make giant-sized spears. The greatest battle trophies come from conquered dragons, and the greatest frost giant jarls wear armor of dragon scales or wield picks and mauls made of a dragon's teeth or claws.": "虽然冰霜巨人认为琐碎的商品制作是他们的劣势，但雕刻和皮革加工是有价值的技能。他们用野兽的皮和骨头制作衣服，将骨头或象牙雕刻成珠宝和武器及工具的把手。他们重复使用较小的敌人的武器和盔甲，把盾牌串成鳞甲，把剑刃绑在木筏上做成巨大的矛。最伟大的战利品来自于被征服的龙，最伟大的冰霜巨人贾尔斯穿着龙鳞的盔甲，或者挥舞着用龙的牙齿或爪子做成的镐和锤子。",

	"Powerful magic allows a spellcaster to summon a galeb duhr from the Plane of Earth. Some galeb duhr also form naturally in places touched by that plane. The galeb duhr is imbued with greater intelligence than most elementals, allowing it to better assess threats and to communicate with creatures entering its guarded area.": "强大的魔法可以让施法者从地球位面召唤出加勒布杜尔。一些加勒布杜尔也会在被该平面触及的地方自然形成。galeb duhr被赋予了比大多数元素更高的智慧，使其能够更好地评估威胁，并与进入其守护区域的生物进行交流。",
	"A galeb duhr doesn't age or require sustenance, making it an excellent sentinel. A powerful druid might charge a galeb duhr with protecting a stone circle or sacred hilltop. Another galeb duhr might be created to guard an underground tomb or a wizard's tower. When it chooses to, the galeb duhr can make itself look like an ordinary boulder, remaining perfectly still for years at a time.": "加勒布杜尔不会衰老，也不需要营养，因此它是一个优秀的哨兵。一个强大的德鲁伊可能会让一个加勒布杜尔来保护一个石圈或神圣的山顶。另一只加勒布杜尔可能会被创造出来保护地下墓穴或巫师的塔。当它选择这样做的时候，Galeb duhr可以让自己看起来像一块普通的巨石，一次可以保持完全静止多年。",

It has an excellent memory and is more than happy to share information regarding its environment with creatures it doesn't regard as threats.": "Galeb duhr永久地被束缚在物质世界中，所以当它死亡时，它不会回到地球世界中。它有很好的记忆力，很乐意与它不认为是威胁的生物分享有关其环境的信息。",
	"A galeb duhr can become one with the earth around it, allowing it to imbue nearby rocks and boulders with a semblance of life. The galeb duhr uses its animated boulders to frighten away interlopers and defend whatever it has been charged to protect. When it needs to move close to those intruders, it presses its limbs tight to its body and rolls forward at a furious pace.": "加勒布杜尔能与周围的土地融为一体，使它能给附近的岩石和巨石注入生命的气息。Galeb duhr用它那有生命力的巨石来吓走入侵者，并保护它被授权保护的东西。当它需要靠近这些入侵者时，它将四肢紧贴身体，以狂暴的速度向前滚动。",
	"The inanimate gargoyles that perch atop great buildings are inspired by these malevolent creatures of elemental earth that resemble grotesque, fiendish statues. A gargoyle lurks among masonry and ruins, as still as any stone sculpture, and delights in the terror it creates when it breaks from its suspended pose, as well as the pain it inflicts on its victims.": "栖息在伟大建筑顶部的无生命的石像鬼的灵感来自于这些来自地球元素的邪恶生物，它们类似于怪诞的、恶魔般的雕像。石像鬼潜伏在砖石和废墟中，像任何石雕一样静止不动，当它从悬空的姿势中挣脱出来时，它以创造恐怖为乐，也以给受害者带来痛苦为乐。",
	"Gargoyles cling to rocky cliffs and mountains, or roost on ledges in underground caves. They haunt city rooftops, perching vulture-like among the high stone arches and buttresses of castles and cathedrals, and they can hold themselves so still that they appear inanimate. Able to maintain this state for years, a gargoyle makes an ideal sentry.": "石像鬼依附在岩石峭壁和山脉上，或在地下洞穴的壁架上栖息。它们在城市的屋顶上出没，像秃鹰一样栖息在城堡和大教堂的高大石拱门和壁垒之间，它们可以保持自己的静止，以至于看起来没有生命。夜行神龙能够保持这种状态多年，是理想的哨兵。",
	"Gargoyles have a reputation for cruelty. Statues carved into the likenesses of gargoyles appear in the architecture of countless cultures to frighten away trespassers. Although such sculptures are only decorative, real gargoyles can hide among them to ambush unsuspecting victims. A gargoyle might alleviate the tedium of its watch by catching and tormenting birds or rodents, but its long wait only increases its craving for harming sentient creatures.": "石像鬼以残忍著称。在无数文化的建筑中都出现了雕刻成石像的雕像，以吓走闯入者。虽然这种雕塑只是装饰性的，但真正的石像鬼可以藏在其中，伏击毫无戒心的受害者。石像鬼可能会通过捕捉和折磨鸟类或啮齿类动物来缓解其枯燥乏味的观察，但其漫长的等待只会增加其对伤害有生命的生物的渴望。",
	"Gargoyles are easily inspired by the cunning of an intelligent master. They enjoy simple tasks such as guarding a master's home, torturing and killing interlopers, and anything else that involves minimum effort and maximum pain and carnage.": "夜行神龙很容易受到聪明主人的狡猾启发。它们喜欢简单的任务，如守卫主人的家，折磨和杀死闯入者，以及其他任何涉及最小努力和最大痛苦与屠杀的事情。",
	"Gargoyles sometimes serve demons for their propensity for wanton chaos and destruction. Powerful spellcasters can also easily enlist gargoyle guardians to keep watch over their gates and walls.

	"Ogrémoch doesn't create gargoyles deliberately, but they are a physical manifestation of his evil. Gargoyles are mockeries of the elemental air that Ogrémoch despises.

	"A gas spore is a hollow shell filled with a lighter-than-air gas that enables it to float as a beholder does.

Its corpse then becomes the spawning ground from which new gas spores arise.": "气体孢子是一个空壳，里面充满了比空气更轻的气体，使它能够像持币人一样漂浮。即使是最弱的攻击也能刺穿外壳，导致生物爆裂，释放出一团致命的孢子。吸入孢子的生物会成为孢子的宿主，通常在一天之内就会死亡。它的尸体会成为新的气体孢子产生的产卵地。",
	"A gas spore that sprouts from a beholder's corpse sometimes carries within it memories of its deceased parent. When the gas spore explodes, its deadly spores cast those memories adrift.

A cube that is well fed can be easier to spot, since its victims' bones, coins, and other objects can be seen suspended inside the creature.": "凝胶状的立方体几乎是透明的，这使得它在攻击之前很难被发现。一个吃饱了的立方体可能更容易被发现，因为它的受害者的骨头、硬币和其他物体可以被看到悬浮在生物体内。",
	"The swarms presented here aren't ordinary or benign assemblies of little creatures. They form as a result of some sinister or unwholesome influence. A vampire can summon swarms of bats and rats from the darkest corners of the night, while the very presence of a mummy lord can cause scarab beetles to boil up from the sand-filled depths of its tomb. A hag might have the power to turn swarms of ravens against her enemies, while a yuan-ti abomination might have swarms of poisonous snakes slithering in its wake. Even druids can't charm these swarms, and their aggressiveness is borderline unnatural.": "这里介绍的蜂群并不是普通的或良性的小生物的集会。它们的形成是一些邪恶或不健康的影响的结果。吸血鬼可以从夜晚最黑暗的角落里召唤出成群的蝙蝠和老鼠，而木乃伊领主的存在可以使疥疮甲虫从充满沙子的坟墓深处沸腾起来。一个巫婆可能有能力让成群的乌鸦对付她的敌人，而一个元始天尊可能会有成群的毒蛇在它身后滑行。即使是德鲁伊也无法魅惑这些蛇群，它们的攻击性是近乎非自然的。",

	"The surest way to rid an area of a ghost is to resolve its unfinished business. A ghost can be destroyed more easily by invoking a weakness tied to its former life.

The ghost of a gardener might become more vulnerable when exposed to a potent floral fragrance.": "摆脱鬼魂的最可靠方法是解决它未完成的事业。通过唤起与其前世有关的弱点，可以更容易地消灭鬼魂。一个被折磨致死的人的鬼魂可能会被折磨的工具再次杀死。一个园丁的鬼魂在接触到强烈的花香时可能会变得更加脆弱。",
	"Sensations of profound sadness, loneliness, and unfulfilled yearning emanate from places where ghostly hauntings occur. Strange sounds or unnatural silences create an unsettling atmosphere.

The ghost has no control over these manifestations; they simply occur.": "深刻的悲伤、孤独和未完成的渴望的感觉从发生鬼魂的地方散发出来。奇怪的声音或不自然的沉默创造了一种令人不安的气氛。在有熊熊大火的房间里会出现冷点。令人窒息的臭味可能会渗入该地区，无生命的物体可能会自行移动，尸体可能会从坟墓中爬出来。鬼魂无法控制这些表现；它们只是发生了。",

	"Like maggots or carrion beetles, ghouls thrive in places rank with decay and death. A ghoul haunts a place where it can gorge on dead flesh and decomposing organs. When it can't feed on the dead, it pursues living creatures and attempts to make corpses of them.

A ghoul's undead flesh never rots, and this monster can persist in a crypt or tomb for untold ages without feeding.": "像蛆虫或腐肉甲虫一样，食尸鬼在腐烂和死亡的地方茁壮成长。食尸鬼出没于一个它可以吞食死肉和腐烂器官的地方。当它不能以死人为食时，它就追捕活人，并试图把他们变成尸体。虽然它们没有从吞噬的尸体中获得任何营养，但食尸鬼被一种无止境的饥饿感所驱使，迫使它们进行消耗。食尸鬼的不死之肉永远不会腐烂，这种怪物可以在墓穴或坟墓中持续数年不进食。",
	"Ghouls trace their origins to the Abyss. Doresain, the first of their kind, was an elf worshiper of Orcus.

Doresain served Orcus faithfully in the Abyss, creating ghouls from the demon lord's other servants until an incursion by Yeenoghu, the demonic Gnoll Lord, robbed Doresain of his abyssal domain. When Orcus would not intervene on his behalf, Doresain turned to the elf gods for salvation, and they took pity on him and helped him escape certain destruction. Since then, elves have been immune to the ghouls' paralytic touch.": "食尸鬼的起源可以追溯到深渊。多雷因，他们的第一个同类，是一个崇拜奥库斯的精灵。他背叛了自己的族人，以人类的肉体为食，以纪念不死之身的恶魔王子。作为对他服务的奖励，奥库斯将多雷因变成了第一个食尸鬼。多雷因在深渊中忠实地服务于奥库斯，从恶魔领主的其他仆人中创造食尸鬼，直到恶魔地精领主耶诺古的入侵，抢走了多雷因的深渊领域。当奥库斯不为他的利益进行干预时，多雷塞恩转向精灵诸神寻求拯救，他们怜悯他并帮助他逃脱了必然的毁灭。从那时起，精灵就对食尸鬼的麻痹性触摸免疫了。",

It isn't considered evil to disrespect or even betray a giant of another type, merely rude.": "无论一个巨人在其自身种族中的等级如何，山地巨人部落的首领都不如最普通的石巨人。任何类型的最低等级的巨人都要优于劣等类型的最高等级的巨人。不尊重甚至背叛另一种类型的巨人并不被认为是邪恶的，只是粗鲁而已。",
	"When the giants' ancient empires fell, Annam, father of all giants, forsook his children and the world. He swore never to look upon either again until the giants had returned to their glory and reclaimed their birthright as rulers of the world. As a result, giants pray not to Annam but to his divine children, along with a host of hero-deities and godly villains that make up the giants' pantheon.": "当巨人的古老帝国衰落时，所有巨人的父亲安南抛弃了他的孩子和世界。他发誓再也不看这两样东西了，直到巨人恢复了他们的荣耀，重新获得他们与生俱来的世界统治者的权利。因此，巨人不是向安纳姆祈祷，而是向他神圣的孩子们祈祷，同时还有一大批英雄神灵和神圣的恶棍，构成了巨人的万神殿。",
	"Chief among these gods are the children of Annam, whose sons represent each type of giant: Stronmaus for storm giants, Memnor for cloud giants, Skoraeus Stonebones for stone giants, Thrym for frost giants, Surtur for fire giants, and Grolantor for hill giants. Not all giants automatically revere their kind's primary deity, however. Many good cloud giants refuse to worship the deceitful Memnor, and a storm giant dwelling in the icy mountains of the north might pay more homage to Thrym than Stronmaus. Other giants feel a stronger connection to Annam's daughters, who include Hiatea, the huntress and home warden; Iallanis, goddess of love and peace; and Diancastra, an impetuous and arrogant trickster.": "这些神灵中最主要的是安南的子孙，他们的儿子代表每一种类型的巨人。斯特朗莫斯（Stronmaus）代表风暴巨人，梅姆诺（Memnor）代表云雾巨人，斯科雷欧斯（Skoraeus）代表石骨巨人，特林（Thrym）代表冰霜巨人，苏尔图尔（Surtur）代表火巨人，戈兰托（Grolantor）代表山丘巨人。然而，并不是所有的巨人都会自动崇敬他们种族的主要神灵。许多善良的云系巨人拒绝崇拜狡诈的梅姆诺尔，而居住在北方冰山的风暴巨人可能会对特里姆而不是斯特龙马斯表示敬意。其他巨人觉得与安南的女儿们有更强的联系，她们包括女猎手和家庭监护人希提亚（Hiatea）、爱与和平女神伊拉尼斯（Iallanis）以及急躁和傲慢的骗子戴安娜（Diancastra）。",
	"Some giants abandon their own gods and fall prey to demon cults, paying homage to Baphomet or Kostchtchie. To worship them or any other non-giant deity is a great sin against the ordning, and almost certain to make a giant an outcast.": "一些巨人放弃了他们自己的神灵，成为恶魔崇拜的牺牲品，向巴弗梅特或科斯特奇致敬。崇拜他们或任何其他非巨人的神灵是对条例的巨大罪过，几乎可以肯定会使巨人成为被抛弃的人。",
	"Of all the terrors created by foul sorcery, gibbering mouthers are among the most wicked and depraved. This creature is the composite eyes, mouths, and liquefied matter of its former victims. Driven to insanity by the destruction of their bodies and absorption into the mouther, those victims gibber incoherent madness, forced to consume everything in reach.": "在所有由肮脏的巫术创造的恐怖中，胡言乱语的人是最邪恶和堕落的。这种生物是由它以前的受害者的眼睛、嘴巴和液化物质合成的。由于身体被毁并被吸收到口器中，这些受害者被逼得精神错乱，疯狂地胡言乱语，被迫吞噬一切可及的东西。",
	"The gibbering mouther's body is an amorphous mass of mouths and eyes that propels itself by oozing forward, fastening several mouths to the ground and pulling its bulk behind. Though it moves slowly, it swims through water, mud, and quicksand with ease.": "胡言乱语者的身体是一个由嘴巴和眼睛组成的无定形物质，它通过向前渗出来推动自己，将几张嘴巴固定在地上，并将自己的身体拉到后面。虽然它行动缓慢，但它可以轻松地游过水、泥和流沙。",
	"When a gibbering mouther senses prey, its mouths begin to murmur and chatter, each with a different voice: deep or shrill, wailing or ululating, crying out in agony or ecstasy. This cacophonous gibbering overcomes the senses of any creature that hears it, causing most to flee in terror. Others are overcome with madness or stand {@condition paralyzed}, fixated on the horrific creature as it oozes forward to consume them.": "当胡言乱语者感觉到猎物时，它的嘴开始喃喃自语，喋喋不休，每个人都有不同的声音：或低沉或尖锐，或哀嚎或咆哮，或痛苦或狂喜地呼喊。这种嘈杂的胡言乱语超越了任何听到它的生物的感官，导致大多数人惊恐地逃离。其他人则被疯狂的情绪所征服，或者站立起来（%0%），盯着这个可怕的生物，因为它正在向前渗出，准备吞噬他们。",
	" Driven to devour any creature it can reach, a gibbering mouther flows over victims transfixed by its mad ranting, its multitudinous voices temporarily silenced as it gnaws and swallows living flesh. The monster liquefies stone with which it comes into contact, hindering creatures that overcome its gibbering and attempt to flee.": " 被驱使着吞噬任何它能接触到的生物，一个胡言乱语的人流在受害者身上，被它疯狂的咆哮所迷惑，当它啃食和吞噬活人的肉体时，它无数的声音暂时沉默了。这个怪物会使接触到的石头液化，阻碍那些克服它的胡言乱语并试图逃离的生物。",
	"A gibbering mouther leaves nothing of its prey behind. However, even as the last of a victim's body is consumed, its eyes and mouth boil to the surface, ready to join the chorus of tormented gibbering that welcomes the monster's next meal.": "口吐白沫的怪物不会留下任何猎物的痕迹。然而，即使在受害者的最后身体被吞噬时，它的眼睛和嘴巴也会浮出水面，准备加入欢迎怪物的下一顿饭的折磨人的胡言乱语的合唱。",
	"The githyanki plunder countless worlds from the decks of their astral vessels and the backs of red dragons. Feathers, beads, gems, and precious metals decorate their armor and weapons-the legendary silver swords with which they cut through their foes. Since winning their freedom from the mind flayers, the githyanki have become ruthless conquerors under the rulership of their dread lich-queen, Vlaakith.": "Githyanki从他们的星际飞船的甲板上和红龙的背上掠夺了无数的世界。羽毛、珠子、宝石和贵重金属装饰着他们的盔甲和武器--传说中的银剑，他们用银剑斩断敌人的身体。自从从思想絮乱者手中赢得自由后，吉蒂扬基人在他们可怕的虱子女王弗拉基斯的统治下，成为无情的征服者。",
	"The githyanki despise all other races, undertaking devastating raids that take them from their strongholds in the Astral Plane to the far flung corners of the multiverse. War is the ultimate expression of githyanki culture, and their pitiless black eyes know no mercy. After a raid, they leave shattered survivors enough food and resources to weakly endure. Later, the githyanki return to their conquered foes, plundering them again and again.": "githyanki蔑视所有其他种族，进行毁灭性的袭击，把他们从星界的据点带到多元宇宙的遥远角落。战争是Githyanki文化的终极表现，他们无情的黑眼睛不懂得怜悯。在一次突袭之后，他们给破碎的幸存者留下足够的食物和资源，让他们虚弱地忍受下去。后来，Githyanki又回到他们被征服的敌人身边，一次又一次地掠夺他们。",
	"In their own language, githyanki means \"followers of Gith.\" Under the guidance of Gith, the githyanki stratified into a militaristic society, with a strict caste system, dedicated to the ongoing fight against the victims and sworn enemies of their race. When their leader Gith perished, she was replaced by her undead adviser, Vlaakith. The lich-queen forbade worship of all beings except herself.": "在他们自己的语言中，githyanki意味着 \"吉斯的追随者\"。在吉斯的指导下，吉蒂扬基人分层成为一个军事化的社会，拥有严格的种姓制度，致力于与他们种族的受害者和死敌持续斗争。当他们的领袖吉斯死后，她被她的不死顾问弗拉基斯取代。荔枝女王禁止崇拜除她自己以外的所有生物。",
	"Of all their enemies, the githyanki most hate their former masters, the mind flayers. Their close kin, the githzerai, are second in their enmity. All other creatures are treated with simple contempt by the githyanki, whose xenophobic pride defines their view of inferior races.": "在所有的敌人中，Githyanki最痛恨他们以前的主人--心灵驱逐者。他们的近亲--吉斯泽拉（githzerai），是他们的第二大敌人。所有其他的生物都被吉蒂亚克人以简单的蔑视对待，他们的排外自豪感决定了他们对低等种族的看法。",
	"In ancient times, gith knights created special weapons to combat their mind flayer masters.": "在古代，吉斯骑士创造了特殊的武器来对抗他们的噬心者主人。",
	"These silver swords channel the force of the wielder's will, dealing psychic as well as physical damage. A githyanki can't become a knight until it masters the singular discipline needed to will such a blade into existence. A silver sword is equivalent to a greatsword, and takes on the properties of a +3 greatsword in the hands of its creator.": "这些银色的剑可以引导持剑者的意志力，造成精神和物理伤害。一个Githyanki只有在掌握了将这样一把剑变成现实所需的单一修炼方法后才能成为一名骑士。银剑相当于一把大剑，在创造者的手中具有+3大剑的属性。",
	"In the eyes of the githyanki, each silver sword is a priceless relic and a work of art. Githyanki knights will hunt down and destroy any non-githyanki that dares to carry or wield a silver sword, reclaiming it for their people.": "在Githyanki眼中，每把银剑都是无价的遗物和艺术品。吉蒂扬基的骑士会追捕并摧毁任何敢于携带或挥舞银剑的非吉蒂扬基人，为他们的人民夺回银剑。",
	"In the uprising against the illithids, Gith sought allies. Her adviser Vlaakith appealed to Tiamat, the goddess of evil dragonkind, and Gith ventured into the Nine Hells to meet with her. Only Tiamat now knows what passed between them, but Vlaakith returned to the Astral Plane with the Dragon Queen's red dragon consort Ephelomon, who proclaimed that his kind would forever act as allies to the githyanki. Not all red dragons honor the alliance kindled so long ago, but most at least don't consider the githyanki their enemies.": "在反对伊利特人的起义中，吉斯寻求盟友。她的顾问弗拉基斯向邪恶的龙族女神提亚马特求助，吉思冒险进入九层地狱与她会面。现在只有提亚马特知道他们之间发生了什么，但弗拉基斯带着龙后的红龙妃子埃菲罗蒙回到了星界，埃菲罗蒙宣称他的同类将永远作为吉特汉克的盟友。并非所有的红龙都尊重很久以前点燃的联盟，但大多数红龙至少不认为吉特亚基是他们的敌人。",
	" Since creatures that dwell on the Astral Plane don't age, the githyanki establish creches in remote areas of the Material Plane to raise their young. Doubling as military academies, these creches train young githyanki to harness their psychic and combat abilities. When a githyanki grows to adulthood and slays a mind flayer as part of a sacred rite of passage, it is permitted to rejoin its people on the Astral Plane.": " 由于居住在星界的生物不会变老，所以吉特汉克人在物质界的偏远地区建立了托儿所来抚养他们的孩子。作为军事学院，这些小窝训练年轻的githyanki利用他们的精神和战斗能力。当githyanki成长为成年人，并作为神圣的通过仪式的一部分杀死了一个噬心者，它就被允许重新加入其在星界的人民。",
	"The warlike githyanki and the contemplative githzerai are a sundered people-two cultures that utterly despise one another. Before there were githyanki or githzerai, these creatures were a single race enslaved by the mind flayers. Although they attempted to overthrow their masters many times, their rebellions were repeatedly crushed until a great leader named Gith arose.": "好战的githyanki和沉思的githzerai是一个分裂的民族--两种完全相互鄙视的文化。在出现githyanki或githzerai之前，这些生物是一个被思想剥落者奴役的单一种族。虽然他们多次试图推翻他们的主人，但他们的叛乱一再被粉碎，直到一个名为吉思的伟大领袖出现。",
	"After much bloodshed, Gith and her followers threw off the yoke of their illithid masters, but another leader named Zerthimon emerged in the aftermath of battle.": "在经历了许多流血事件后，吉斯和她的追随者们甩掉了他们的伊里希德主人的枷锁，但在战斗结束后，出现了另一个名为泽尔西蒙的领袖。",
	"Zerthimon challenged Gith's motives, claiming that her strict martial leadership and desire for vengeance amounted to little more than another form of slavery for her people. A rift erupted between followers of each leader, and they eventually became the two races whose enmity endures to this day.": "泽尔西蒙对吉斯的动机提出质疑，声称她严格的军事领导和对复仇的渴望不过是对她的人民的另一种形式的奴役而已。两位领袖的追随者之间爆发了裂痕，他们最终成为两个种族，其敌意持续到今天。",
	"Whether these tall, gaunt creatures were peaceful or savage, cultured or primitive before the mind flayers enslaved and changed them, none can say. Not even the original name of their race remains from that distant time.": "这些高大、憔悴的生物，在被心灵传播者奴役和改变之前，是和平的还是野蛮的，是有文化的还是原始的，没有人能够说清楚。在那个遥远的年代，甚至连他们种族的原始名称都没有留下。",
	"Focused philosophers and austere ascetics, the githzerai pursue lives of rigid order. Lean and muscular, they wear unadorned clothing free of ornamentation, keeping their own counsel and trusting few creatures outside of their own kind. Having turned their backs on their warlike githyanki kin, the githzerai maintain a strict monastic lifestyle, dwelling on islands of order in the vast sea of chaos that is the plane of Limbo.": "专注的哲学家和严格的禁欲主义者，吉斯泽拉人追求严格的秩序生活。他们身材瘦削，肌肉发达，穿着没有任何装饰的衣服，保持自己的意见，几乎不信任同类之外的生物。在背弃了他们好战的吉提安基族人后，吉斯泽拉人保持着严格的僧侣生活方式，居住在林波平面这个巨大的混乱之海中的秩序之岛上。",
	"The progenitors of the githzerai adapted to-and were transformed by-the psychic environment imposed on them by their illithid overlords. Under the teachings of Zerthimon, who called on his people to abandon the warlike ambitions of Gith, the githzerai focused their mental energy on creating physical and psychic barriers to protect them from attack, psychic or otherwise. Fighting is personal to a githzerai, which uses its mind to daze and incapacitate opponents, leaving them vulnerable to physical punishment.": "吉斯泽拉人的祖先适应了他们的伊里西德统治者强加给他们的精神环境，并且被这种环境所改变。在Zerthimon的教导下，他号召他的人民放弃吉斯的战争野心，githzerai将他们的精神能量集中在创造物理和精神障碍上，以保护他们免受精神或其他方面的攻击。战斗是吉思塞拉伊的个人行为，它用自己的心智来迷惑对手并使其丧失能力，使其容易受到身体的惩罚。",
	"The githzerai willingly dwell in the heart of utter chaos in Limbo-a twisting, mercurial plane prone to manipulation and subjugation by githzerai minds strong enough to master it. Limbo is a maelstrom of primal matter and energy, its terrain a storm of rock and earth swept up in torrents of murky liquid, buffeted by strong winds, blasted by fire, and chilled by crushing walls of ice.": "吉斯泽拉人心甘情愿地居住在Limbo这个完全混乱的中心地带--一个扭曲、多变的平面，很容易被足以掌握它的吉斯泽拉人的思想所操纵和奴役。林波是一个原始物质和能量的漩涡，它的地形是由岩石和泥土组成的风暴，被浑浊的液体卷起，被强风吹动，被火烧毁，被破碎的冰墙冻住。",
	"The forces of Limbo react to sentience, however. Using the power of their minds, the githzerai tame the plane's chaotic elements, causing them to settle into fixed and survivable forms and creating oases and sanctuaries within the maelstrom.": "然而，Limbo的力量对有意识的反应。利用他们心灵的力量，吉斯泽拉人驯服了飞机上的混乱元素，使它们变成固定的、可生存的形式，并在大漩涡中创造出绿洲和避难所。",
	"Githzerai fortress-monasteries stand resolute against the chaos that surrounds them, virtually impervious to the turmoil of their surroundings, because the githzerai will it.

Behind their psionically fortified walls, the githzerai embrace thought, learning, psionic power, order, and discipline above all other things.": "Githzerai堡垒-寺院坚定地站在他们周围的混乱中，几乎不受周围环境的动荡影响，因为Githzerai愿意这样。每座寺院都由僧侣监督，他们根据自己的理念，严格安排诵经、用餐、武术训练和奉献。在他们的灵媒加固的墙壁后面，githzerai拥护思想、学习、灵媒力量、秩序和纪律，高于其他一切。",
	"The social hierarchy of the githzerai is based on merit, and those githzerai who are the wisest teachers and the most skilled at physical and mental combat become leaders. The githzerai revere great heroes and teachers of the past, emulating those figures' virtues in their everyday lives.": "吉斯泽拉人的社会等级制度是以功绩为基础的，那些最聪明的老师和最擅长身体和精神战斗的吉斯泽拉人成为领导者。吉斯泽拉人崇尚过去的伟大英雄和教师，在日常生活中模仿这些人物的美德。",
	"Githzerai revere Zerthimon, the founder of their race. Although Gith won their people's freedom, Zerthimon saw her as unfit to lead. He believed that her warmongering would soon make her a tyrant no better than the mind flayers.": "吉斯泽拉人崇敬他们种族的创始人泽尔西蒙。虽然吉斯为他们的人民赢得了自由，但泽尔西蒙认为她不适合做领导。他认为，她的好战行为很快就会使她成为一个暴君，不会比思想絮乱者更好。",
	"Skilled githzerai monks that best exemplify the teachings and principles of Zerthimon are called zerths.": "最能体现Zerthimon教义和原则的熟练Githzerai僧侣被称为Zerths。",

	"Though githzerai rarely deal with the realms beyond Limbo, advanced monks of other races sometimes seek out a githzerai monastery and attempt to gain admittance as students. More rarely, a githzerai master establishes a hidden monastery on the Material Plane to train young githzerai or to spread the philosophy and teachings of Zerthimon.": "虽然吉塞拉人很少与林波以外的领域打交道，但其他种族的高级僧侣有时会寻找吉塞拉人的寺院，并试图获得入学资格。更为罕见的是，一位吉斯泽拉大师在物质世界建立了一座隐秘的寺院，以训练年轻的吉斯泽拉，或传播泽尔西蒙的哲学和教义。",
	"As disciplined as they are, the githzerai have never forgotten their long imprisonment by the mind flayers.": "尽管他们纪律严明，但吉斯泽拉人从来没有忘记他们被心灵驱逐者长期监禁的事实。",

	"Although glabrezus are devastating in combat, they prefer to tempt victims into ruin, using power or wealth as a lure. Engaging in guile, trickery, and evil bargains, a glabrezu hoards riches that it uses to fulfill promises to shortsighted summoners and weak-willed mortals. However, if its attempts to entice or deceive fail, a glabrezu has the strength to fight and win.": "虽然格拉布瑞兹在战斗中是毁灭性的，但他们更喜欢用权力或财富作为诱饵来诱惑受害者走向毁灭。通过狡猾、诡计和邪恶的交易，格拉布瑞兹囤积财富，用来兑现对目光短浅的召唤者和意志薄弱的凡人的承诺。然而，如果它引诱或欺骗的尝试失败了，glabrezu有力量去战斗并赢得胜利。",
	"Gladiators battle for the entertainment of raucous crowds. Some gladiators are brutal pit fighters who treat each match as a life-or-death struggle, while others are professional duelists who command huge fees but rarely fight to the death.": "角斗士们为了娱乐喧闹的人群而战斗。一些角斗士是残酷的竞技场斗士，他们把每场比赛当作生死之战，而另一些角斗士则是专业的决斗者，他们收取巨额费用，但很少进行生死之战。",

	"The origin of the gnolls traces back to a time when the demon lord Yeenoghu found his way to the Material Plane and ran amok. Packs of ordinary hyenas followed in his wake, scavenging the demon lord's kills. Those hyenas were transformed into the first gnolls, parading after Yeenoghu until he was banished back to the Abyss. The gnolls then scattered across the face of the world, a dire reminder of demonic power.": "地精的起源可以追溯到一个时期，当时恶魔领主Yeenoghu找到了他的方式，并在物质世界横行。成群结队的普通鬣狗跟在他后面，搜刮恶魔领主的杀戮。这些鬣狗变成了第一批地精，在耶诺古身后游行，直到他被驱逐回深渊。然后，这些地精散落在世界的各个角落，成为恶魔力量的可怕提醒。"
