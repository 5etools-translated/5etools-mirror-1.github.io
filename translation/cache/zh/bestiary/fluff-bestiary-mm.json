	"Aarakocra range the Howling Gyre, an endless storm of mighty winds and lashing rains that surrounds the tranquil realm of Aaqa in the Elemental Plane of Air. Making aerial patrols, these birdlike humanoids guard the windy borders of their home against invaders from the Elemental Plane of Earth, such as gargoyles, their sworn enemies.": "Aarakocra的活动范围是咆哮环流，这是一场无尽的风暴，由强大的风和猛烈的雨组成，环绕着空气元素界的宁静的Aaqa境界。在空中巡逻时，这些鸟类人形生物守护着他们家园多风的边界，防止来自地球元素界的入侵者，比如他们的死敌--巨妖。",
	"In service to the Wind Dukes of Aaqa, aarakocra scout the planes in search of temples of Elemental Evil. They spy on malign elemental creatures and then either take the fight to those creatures or report back to the Wind Dukes.": "在为Aaqa的风之公爵服务时，Aarakocra在各星球上寻找元素邪恶的神庙。他们监视着邪恶的元素生物，然后要么与这些生物战斗，要么向风公爵报告。",
	"On the Material Plane, aarakocra create aeries atop the highest mountains, especially peaks near portals to the Elemental Plane of Air. From such heights, aarakocra watch for signs of elemental incursions, as well as for nascent threats to their home plane. Aarakocra prefer to live their lives like the wind-unburdened and ever moving-yet they watch over a region for years if that's what it takes to guard against the incursions of Elemental Evil.": "在物质界，阿拉科克拉在最高的山峰上建立了一个空洞，特别是在通往空气元素界的门户附近的山峰。在这样的高度上，阿拉科克拉人观察着元素入侵的迹象，以及对他们的母体世界的新生威胁。Aarakocra更喜欢像风一样生活--没有负担和不断移动--但他们会监视一个地区很多年，如果这是为了防止元素邪恶的入侵。"
