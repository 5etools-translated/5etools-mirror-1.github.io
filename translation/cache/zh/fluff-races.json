	"Sequestered in high mountains atop tall trees, the aarakocra, sometimes called birdfolk, evoke fear and wonder. Many aarakocra aren't even native to the Material Plane. They hail from a world beyond-from the boundless vistas of the Elemental Plane of Air. They are immigrants, refugees, scouts, and explorers, their outposts functioning as footholds in a world both strange and alien.": "隐居在高山高树之上的阿拉科克拉，有时被称为鸟人，唤起人们的恐惧和好奇。许多阿拉科克拉甚至不是物质世界的原住民。他们来自一个更远的世界--来自空气元素界的无尽远景。他们是移民、难民、侦察员和探险家，他们的前哨站在一个既陌生又陌生的世界中起着立足点的作用。",
	"From below, aarakocra look much like large birds. Only when they descend to roost on a branch or walk across the ground does their humanoid appearance reveal itself. Standing upright, aarakocra might reach 5 feet tall, and they have long, narrow legs that taper to sharp talons.": "从下面看，Aarakocra很像大鸟。只有当它们下降到树枝上栖息或走过地面时，它们的人形外观才会显现出来。直立时，阿拉科克拉可能达到5英尺高，它们有长而窄的腿，渐渐变成锋利的爪子。",
	"Feathers cover their bodies. Their plumage typically denotes membership in a tribe. Males are brightly colored, with feathers of red, orange, or yellow. Females have more subdued colors, usually brown or gray. Their heads complete the avian appearance, being something like a parrot or eagle with distinct tribal variations.": "羽毛覆盖他们的身体。它们的羽毛通常代表着一个部落的成员。雄性的羽毛颜色鲜艳，有红色、橙色或黄色的羽毛。雌性的颜色比较低调，通常是棕色或灰色。它们的头完成了禽类的外观，像鹦鹉或鹰一样，有明显的部落变化。",
	"Nowhere are the aarakocra more comfortable than in the sky. They can spend hours in the air, and some go as long as days, locking their wings in place and letting the thermals hold them aloft. In battle, they prove dynamic and acrobatic fliers, moving with remarkable speed and grace, diving to lash opponents with weapons or talons before turning and flying away.": "没有什么地方比在天空中更舒适了。它们可以在空中停留数小时，有些甚至可以停留数天，把翅膀锁在原地，让热气流托着它们飞翔。在战斗中，它们被证明是充满活力的杂技飞行者，以非凡的速度和优雅的姿态移动，在转身飞走之前俯冲到对手身上用武器或爪子猛击对手。",
	"Once airborne, an aarakocra leaves the sky with reluctance. On their native plane, they can fly for days or months, landing only to lay their eggs and feed their young before launching themselves back into the air. Those that make it to a world in the Material Plane find it a strange place. They sometimes forget or ignore vertical distances, and they have nothing but pity for those earthbound people forced to live and toil on the ground.": "一旦飞上天空，Aarakocra就会不情愿地离开天空。在它们的母体上，它们可以飞行数天或数月，只在降落时产卵和喂养幼崽，然后再飞回空中。那些来到物质界的人发现那是一个奇怪的地方。它们有时会忘记或忽略垂直距离，它们对那些被迫在地面上生活和劳作的地球人只有怜悯。",
	"The resemblance of aarakocra to birds isn't limited to physical features. Aarakocra display many of the same mannerisms as ordinary birds. They are fastidious about their plumage, frequently tending their feathers, cleaning and scratching away any tiny passengers they might have picked up. When they deign to descend from the sky, they often do so near pools where they can catch fish and bathe themselves.": "Aarakocra与鸟类的相似之处并不限于身体特征。Aarakocra表现出许多与普通鸟类相同的举止。它们对自己的羽毛非常挑剔，经常打理自己的羽毛，清洗和抓去它们可能捡到的任何小乘客。当它们决定从空中降落时，它们经常在水池附近这样做，在那里它们可以捕鱼和洗澡。",
	"Many aarakocra punctuate their speech with chirps, sounds they use to convey emphasis and to shade meaning, much as a human might through facial expressions and gestures. An aarakocra might become frustrated with people who fail to pick up on the nuances; an aarakocra's threat might be taken as a jest and vice versa.": "许多arakocra用鸣叫声作为他们讲话的标点，他们用这些声音来表达强调和遮掩意思，就像人类通过面部表情和手势来表达一样。对于那些不能理解其中细微差别的人，阿拉科拉人可能会感到沮丧；阿拉科拉人的威胁可能会被认为是一种玩笑，反之亦然。",
	"The idea of ownership baffles most aarakocra. After all, who owns the sky? Even when explained to them, they initially find the notion of ownership mystifying.": "所有权的概念使大多数阿拉科拉人感到困惑。毕竟，谁拥有天空？即使向他们解释，他们最初也觉得所有权的概念很神秘。",
	"As a result, aarakocra who have little interaction with other people might be a nuisance as they drop from the sky to snatch livestock or plunder harvests for fruits and grains. Shiny, glittering objects catch their eyes. They find it hard not to pluck the treasure and bring it back to their settlement to beautify it. An aarakocra who spends years among other races can learn to inhibit these impulses.": "因此，很少与其他人交往的阿拉科克拉可能会成为一个讨厌鬼，因为他们从天而降，抢夺牲畜或掠夺收成的水果和谷物。闪亮、闪光的物体吸引着他们的目光。他们发现很难不去摘取宝物，并将其带回自己的居住地，以美化它。一个在其他种族中生活多年的阿拉科克拉人可以学会抑制这些冲动。",
	"Confinement terrifies the aarakocra. To be grounded, trapped underground, or imprisoned by the cold, unyielding earth is a torment few aarakocra can withstand. Even when perched on a high branch or at rest in their mountaintop homes, they appear alert, with eyes moving and bodies ready to take flight.": "监禁使阿拉科拉人感到恐惧。被禁足，被困在地下，或被冰冷不屈的大地囚禁，是很少有阿拉科克拉人能够承受的折磨。即使是栖息在高高的树枝上或在山顶的家中休息，它们也显得很警觉，眼睛在动，身体准备飞起来。",
	"Most aarakocra live on the Elemental Plane of Air. Aarakocra can be drawn into the Material Plane, sometimes to pursue enemies or thwart their foes' designs there. Accident might also send a nest of aarakocra tumbling into a world on that plane. A few find their way to such a world through portals on their own plane and establish nests in high mountains or in the canopies of old forests.": "大多数阿拉科克拉人生活在空气元素界。Aarakocra可以被吸引到物质位面，有时是为了追击敌人或挫败敌人在那里的设计。意外事故也可能使一窝阿拉科克拉翻滚着进入该平面的世界。少数会通过自己位面的传送门找到这样的世界，并在高山上或古老森林的树冠上建立巢穴。",
	"Once tribes of aarakocra settle in an area, they share a hunting territory that extends across an area up to 100 miles on a side, with each tribe hunting in the lands nearest to their colony, ranging farther should game become scarce.": "一旦Aarakocra部落在一个地区定居，他们就会共享一个狩猎领地，该领地边长达100英里，每个部落都在离其殖民地最近的土地上狩猎，如果猎物变得稀少，则范围更广。",
	"A typical colony consists of one large, open-roofed nest made of woven vines. The eldest acts as leader with the support of a shaman.": "一个典型的群落由一个用藤蔓编织的大型敞篷巢穴组成。最年长的人在萨满的支持下充当领袖。",
	"Never well established in Faerûn, aarakocra have only four major colonies: in the Star Mounts within the High Forest, in the Storm Horns in Cormyr, in the Cloven Mountains on the Vilhon Reach, and in the Mistcliffs in Chult.": "阿拉科拉在法鲁恩从来没有很好地建立过，只有四个主要的殖民地：在高级森林的星辰山，在科米尔的风暴之角，在维尔洪河畔的梭罗山，以及在楚尔特的雾崖。",
	"Those colonies established in the Star Mounts, closest to the Dessarin Valley, were ever a secretive and guarded people, only spotted during their flights over the High Forest. A cruel and rapacious green dragon nearly wiped out the population and scattered the survivors. These aarakocra and their descendants have sworn vengeance against the dragon and may be seen scouring the lands of the North and Cormyr for signs of their foe.": "那些建立在离德萨林谷最近的星辰山的殖民地，从来都是一个神秘的、被保护的民族，只有在他们飞越高级森林时才会被发现。一条残忍而贪婪的绿龙几乎消灭了这些人，并使幸存者四散。这些阿拉科克拉人和他们的后裔发誓要向龙复仇，并且可以看到他们在北方和科米尔的土地上搜寻敌人的痕迹。",
	"Their only remaining settlement lies on the slopes of the Star Mounts' southernmost mountains. At the headwaters of the Unicorn Run, the Last Aerie is home to several dozen aarakocra. Recently, aarakocra elders detected changes in the prevailing winds that they regarded as a bad omen.": "他们唯一剩下的定居点位于星山最南端的山坡上。在独角兽河的上游，最后的Aerie是几十个Aarakocra的家。最近，Aarakocra的长老们发现盛行风的变化，他们认为这是一个坏兆头。",
	"Unlike the aarakocra of other worlds on the Material Plane, the aarakocra of the Realms rarely travel to the Elemental Plane of Air.": "与物质界其他世界的阿拉科克拉不同，王国的阿拉科克拉很少前往空气元素界。",
	"Aarakocra enjoy peace and solitude. Most of them have little interest in dealing with other peoples and less interest in spending time on the ground. For this reason, it takes an exceptional circumstance for an aarakocra to leave his or her tribe and undertake the adventurer's life. Neither treasure nor glory is enough to lure them from their tribes; a dire threat to their people, a mission of vengeance, or a catastrophe typically lies at the heart of the aarakocra adventurer's chosen path.": "Aarakocra享受和平和孤独。他们中的大多数人对与其他民族打交道兴趣不大，对在地面上花时间的兴趣更小。由于这个原因，一个阿拉科克拉人需要在特殊情况下离开他或她的部落，过上冒险家的生活。宝藏和荣誉都不足以吸引他们离开部落；他们的人民面临着可怕的威胁，一个复仇的任务，或者一场灾难，通常是arakocra冒险家选择道路的核心所在。",
	"Two other circumstances might call an aarakocra to adventure. First, aarakocra have historical ties to the Wind Dukes of Aqaa. Exceptional individuals honor that connection and might seek out the missing pieces of the Rod of Seven Parts, the remains of an artifact fashioned by the Wind Dukes long ago to defeat the Queen of Chaos's monstrous champion, Miska the Wolf-Spider.": "还有两种情况可能会召唤阿拉科克拉人去冒险。首先，Aarakocra与Aqaa的风公爵有历史联系。特殊的人尊重这种关系，并可能寻找七部之棒的缺失部分，这是风公爵很久以前为打败混沌女王的怪物冠军狼蛛米斯卡而制造的神器遗迹。",
	"When plunged into Miska's body, the chaos in his blood sundered the rod and scattered its pieces across the multiverse. Recovering the pieces means gaining honor and esteem in the eyes of the vaati who forged it and could possibly restore a powerful weapon for defense against the agents of elemental evil.": "当插入Miska的身体时，他血液中的混沌将棍子分解，并将其碎片散落在多元宇宙中。恢复这些碎片意味着在铸造它的瓦提人眼中获得荣誉和尊敬，并可能恢复一个强大的武器，以防御元素邪恶的代理人。",
	"Second, aarakocra are sworn foes of elemental earth, in particular the gargoyles that serve Ogrémoch, the Prince of Earth. The Aarakocra word for gargoyle is loosely translated as \"flying rock,\" and battles between aarakocra and gargoyles have raged across the Elemental Planes of Earth and Air, occasionally spilling into a world on the Material Plane. Aarakocra on that plane might leave their colonies to lend aid to other humanoids committed to fighting earth cults and thwarting their efforts.": "其次，Aarakocra是地球元素的死敌，尤其是为地球王子奥格瑞莫赫服务的巨妖。Aarakocra对夜行神龙的说法被松散地翻译为 \"飞石\"，Aarakocra和夜行神龙之间的战斗已经在地球和空气的元素界肆虐，偶尔会蔓延到物质界的世界。物质界的阿拉科克拉可能会离开他们的殖民地，向其他致力于打击地球邪教并挫败其努力的人类提供援助。",
	"As with much of their speech, aarakocra names include clicks, trills, and whistles to the point that other peoples have a difficult time pronouncing them. Typically, a name has two to four syllables with the sounds acting as connectors. When interacting with other races, aarakocra may use nicknames gained from people they meet or shortened forms of their full names.": "与他们的大部分言语一样，阿拉科克拉人的名字也包括点击声、颤音和口哨声，以至于其他人很难读出它们。通常情况下，一个名字有两到四个音节，声音起到连接作用。在与其他种族交往时，阿拉科克拉人可能会使用从他们遇到的人那里获得的绰号或全名的缩写形式。",
	"An aarakocra of either gender may have one of these short names: Aera, Aial, Aur, Deekek, Errk, Heehk, Ikki, Kleeck, Oorr, Ouss, Quaf, Quierk, Salleek, Urreek, or Zeed.": "任何性别的阿拉科克拉都可以有这些简短的名字之一。Aera, Aial, Aur, Deekek, Errk, Heehk, Ikki, Kleeck, Oorr, Ouss, Quaf, Quierk, Salleek, Urreek, 或Zeed。",
	"Backgrounds that are most appropriate for aarakocra include the outlander, the hermit, and the sage.": "最适合阿拉科克拉的背景包括外乡人、隐士和圣人。",
	"The small colonies of aarakocra are insular and remote, and few aarakocra live away from their roosts. In the Star Mounts of the High Forest in the Forgotten Realms, no more than a few dozen aarakocra live away from the nests of their families. Those that do are usually rangers or fighters, constantly patrolling for outside threats.": "Aarakocra的小聚居地是孤立和偏远的，很少有Aarakocra离开它们的巢穴而生活。在被遗忘的领域中的高级森林的星辰山，不超过几十个arakocra住在他们家庭的巢穴之外。那些人通常是护林员或战士，不断巡逻以防止外部威胁。",
	"A winged people who originated on the Elemental Plane of Air, aarakocra soar through the sky wherever they wander. The first aarakocra served the Wind Dukes of Aaqa—mighty beings of air—and were imbued with a measure of their masters' power over winds. Their descendants still command echoes of that power.": "一个起源于空气元素界的有翼民族，无论他们在哪里游荡，阿拉科克拉都能在天空中翱翔。最早的阿拉科克拉为阿卡的风公爵--强大的空气生物服务，并被赋予了他们的主人对风的力量。他们的后代仍然拥有这种力量的回声。",
	"From below, aarakocra look like large birds and thus are sometimes called birdfolk. Only when they roost on a branch or walk across the ground is their Humanoid nature clear. Standing upright, aarakocra are typically about 5 feet tall, and they have long, narrow legs that taper to sharp talons. Feathers cover their bodies—usually red, orange, yellow, brown, or gray. Their heads are also avian, often resembling those of parrots or eagles.": "从下面看，Aarakocra看起来像大鸟，因此有时被称为鸟人。只有当它们在树枝上栖息或在地面上行走时，它们的类人本性才清晰可见。直立时，阿拉科克拉通常有5英尺高，他们有狭长的腿，渐渐变成锋利的爪子。羽毛覆盖着他们的身体--通常是红色、橙色、黄色、棕色或灰色。它们的头部也是禽类，通常类似于鹦鹉或鹰的头部。",
	"Whether descended from a celestial being or infused with heavenly power, aasimar are mortals who carry a spark of the Upper Planes within their souls. They can fan that spark to bring light, ease wounds, and unleash the fury of the heavens.": "不管是来自天人的后裔，还是被注入了天国的力量，阿西玛人都是在灵魂中带着上层世界的火花的凡人。他们可以用这种火花带来光明，缓解伤口，并释放出天堂的愤怒。",
	"Aasimar can arise among any population of mortals. They resemble their parents, but they live for up to 160 years and often have features that hint at their celestial heritage. These often begin subtle and become more obvious when the aasimar gains the ability to reveal their full celestial nature. The Aasimar Celestial Features table has examples you can choose or use as inspiration to create your own.": "Aasimar可以在任何凡人群体中出现。他们与他们的父母相似，但他们的寿命长达160年，并且经常有一些暗示他们天人遗产的特征。这些特征开始时很微妙，当阿西玛人获得了揭示其全部天人本性的能力时就会变得更加明显。阿西玛人的天体特征表有一些例子，你可以选择或作为灵感来创造你自己的。",
	"A dusting of metallic, white, or charcoal freckles": "一片金属色、白色或炭色的雀斑粉尘",
	"Metallic, luminous, or dark eyes": "金属的、发光的或黑暗的眼睛",
	"Starkly colored hair": "颜色鲜明的头发",
	"An unusual hue tinting your shadow": "一个不寻常的色调染红了你的影子",
	"A ghostly halo crowning your head": "幽灵般的光环在你的头上加冕",
	"Rainbows gleaming on your skin": "在你的皮肤上闪耀着彩虹",
	"Aasimar bear within their souls the light of the heavens. They are descended from humans with a touch of the power of Mount Celestia, the divine realm of many lawful good deities. Aasimar are born to serve as champions of the gods, their births hailed as blessed events. They are a people of otherworldly visages, with luminous features that reveal their celestial heritage.": "阿西玛人的灵魂中蕴含着天堂之光。他们是人类的后代，带有天山的力量，天山是许多合法善神的神圣领域。阿西玛人出生时是作为众神的拥护者，他们的出生被誉为受祝福的事件。他们是一个有着超凡容貌的民族，发光的特征显示了他们的天体遗产。",
	"With your DM's consent, you can change your character's subrace to fallen aasimar if your protector/scourge aasimar turns to evil. To do so, replace your subrace benefits, including the ability score increase, with those of a fallen aasimar.": "经DM同意，如果你的保护者/祸害阿西玛尔变成了邪恶，你可以将你的角色的亚种改为堕落阿西玛尔。要做到这一点，就要用堕落的阿西玛人的优点来取代你的亚种的优点，包括能力分数的增加。",
	"Similarly, if your fallen aasimar turns to good, your DM might allow you to become a protector or scourge aasimar.": "同样地，如果你的堕落的阿西玛尔变成了好人，你的DM可能会允许你成为一个保护者或祸害阿西玛尔。",
	"Aasimar are placed in the world to serve as guardians of law and good. Their patrons expect them to strike at evil, lead by example, and further the cause of justice.": "Aasimar被安置在这个世界上，充当法律和善的守护者。他们的赞助人希望他们能够打击邪恶，以身作则，并促进正义事业。",
	"From an early age, an aasimar receives visions and guidance from celestial entities via dreams. These dreams help shape an aasimar, granting a sense of destiny and a desire for righteousness.": "从很小的时候起，阿西玛人就通过梦境接受天体的幻觉和指导。这些梦境有助于塑造阿西玛尔，赋予其命运感和对正义的渴望。",
	"Each aasimar can count a specific celestial agent of the gods as a guide. This entity is typically a deva, an angel who acts as a messenger to the mortal world.": "每个阿西玛人都可以算上一个特定的天神代理人作为向导。这个实体通常是一个魔王，一个充当凡人世界的信使的天使。",
	"While aasimar are strident foes of evil, they typically prefer to keep a low profile. An aasimar inevitably draws the attention of evil cultists, fiends, and other enemies of good, all of whom would be eager to strike down a celestial champion if they had the chance.": "虽然阿西玛尔是邪恶的坚定敌人，但他们通常更喜欢保持低调。一个阿西玛尔不可避免地会引起邪恶的邪教徒、恶魔和其他正义的敌人的注意，如果有机会的话，他们都会急于击倒一个天神的冠军。",
	"When traveling, aasimar prefer hoods, closed helms, and other gear that allows them to conceal their identities. They nevertheless have no compunction about striking openly at evil. The secrecy they desire is never worth endangering the innocent.": "旅行时，阿西玛人喜欢戴头罩、封闭的头盔，以及其他能让他们掩盖身份的装备。然而，他们对公开打击邪恶毫无顾忌。他们渴望的秘密绝不值得危害无辜者。",
	"An aasimar, except for one who has turned to evil, has a link to an angelic being. That being—usually a deva—provides guidance to the aasimar, though this connection functions only in dreams. As such, the guidance is not a direct command or a simple spoken word. Instead, the aasimar receives visions, prophecies, and feelings.": "一个阿西玛人，除了已经转向邪恶的人，与一个天使般的存在有联系。那个生命--通常是一个魔王--向阿西玛尔提供指导，尽管这种联系只在梦中发挥作用。因此，指导不是一个直接的命令或一个简单的口头语。相反，阿西玛尔会收到幻觉、预言和感觉。",
	"The angelic being is far from omniscient. Its guidance is based on its understanding of the tenets of law and good, and it might have insight into combating especially powerful evils that it knows about.": "天使的存在远非全知全能。它的指导是基于它对法律和善的信条的理解，而且它可能对打击它所知道的特别强大的邪恶有洞察力。",
	"As part of fleshing out an aasimar character, consider the nature of that character's angelic guide. The Angelic Guide tables offer names and natures that you can use to flesh out your character's guide.": "作为充实阿西玛人角色的一部分，考虑该角色的天使向导的性质。天使指南表提供了名称和性质，你可以用它来充实你的角色的指南。",

	"The deva, or other celestial being, is your chance to add special roleplaying opportunities to the game. Remember, a deva lives in a realm of absolute law and good. The deva might not understand the compromises and hard choices that mortals must grapple with in the world. To the deva, an aasimar is a prized student who must live up to high, sometimes inflexible standards.": "魔王，或其他天人，是你为游戏增加特殊角色扮演机会的机会。请记住，魔王生活在一个绝对的法律和善的领域。魔鬼可能不理解凡人在这个世界上必须努力的妥协和艰难的选择。对魔王来说，阿西玛人是一个珍贵的学生，必须达到高标准，有时是僵硬的标准。",
	"Despite its celestial origin, an aasimar is mortal and possesses free will. Most aasimar follow their ordained path, but some grow to see their abilities as a curse. These disaffected aasimar are typically content to turn away from the world, but a few become agents of evil. In their minds, their exposure to celestial powers amounted to little more than brainwashing.": "尽管是天体，但阿西玛人是凡人，拥有自由意志。大多数阿西玛人遵循他们被指定的道路，但有些人逐渐将他们的能力视为一种诅咒。这些心怀不满的阿西玛人通常满足于远离这个世界，但也有少数人成为邪恶的代理人。在他们看来，他们接触到的天体力量不过是洗脑而已。",
	"Evil aasimar make deadly foes. The radiant power they once commanded becomes corrupted into a horrid, draining magic. And their angelic guides abandon them.": "邪恶的阿西玛人是致命的敌人。他们曾经指挥的光芒万丈的力量被腐蚀成了一种可怕的、耗费精力的魔法。他们的天使向导也抛弃了他们。",
	"Even aasimar wholly dedicated to good sometimes feel torn between two worlds. The angels that guide them see the world from a distant perch. An aasimar who wishes to stop and help a town recover from a drought might be told by an angelic guide to push forward on a greater quest. To a distant angel, saving a few commoners might pale in comparison to defeating a cult of Orcus. An aasimar's guide is wise but not infallible.": "即使是完全献身于善的阿西玛，有时也会在两个世界之间感到纠结。引导他们的天使从一个遥远的高处看这个世界。一个希望停下来帮助一个城镇从干旱中恢复的阿西玛人，可能会被天使引导者告知要在更大的任务中前进。对一个遥远的天使来说，拯救几个平民可能比打败一个奥库斯的邪教更微不足道。一个阿西玛人的向导是明智的，但不是无懈可击的。",
	"Most aasimar are born from human parents, and they use the same naming conventions as their native culture.": "大多数阿西玛人都是由人类父母所生，他们使用的命名方式与他们的本土文化相同。",
	"An aasimar who was touched by dark powers as a youth or who turns to evil in early adulthood can become one of the fallen-a group of aasimar whose inner light has been replaced by shadow.": "年轻时被黑暗力量触及的阿西玛人，或在成年早期转向邪恶的阿西玛人可以成为堕落者之一--一群内心的光明被阴影取代的阿西玛人。",
	"Protector aasimar are charged by the powers of good to guard the weak, to strike at evil wherever it arises, and to stand vigilant against the darkness. From a young age, a protector aasimar receives advice and directives that urge to stand against evil.": "守护者阿西玛被善的力量责成保护弱者，打击任何出现的邪恶，并对黑暗保持警惕。从年轻时起，保护者阿西玛尔就会收到敦促其对抗邪恶的建议和指令。",
	"Scourge aasimar are imbued with a divine energy that blazes intensely within them. It feeds a powerful desire to destroy evil-a desire that is, at its best, unflinching and, at its worst, all-consuming. Many scourge aasimar wear masks to block out the world and focus on containing this power, unmasking themselves only in battle.": "Scourge aasimar被赋予了一种神圣的能量，这种能量在他们体内强烈地燃烧着。它滋养了摧毁邪恶的强大欲望--这种欲望在最好的情况下是坚定不移的，在最坏的情况下则是无所不用其极的。许多 \"祸害 \"Aasimar戴着面具遮挡世界，专注于控制这种力量，只有在战斗中才会揭开面具。",
	"Long ago, groups of elves ventured from the Feywild to the Astral Plane to be closer to their gods. Life in the Silver Void has imbued their souls with a spark of divine light. That light manifests as a starry gleam in an astral elf's eyes.": "很久以前，成群结队的精灵从精灵世界冒险来到星界，以接近他们的神灵。银色虚空中的生活为他们的灵魂注入了神圣之光的火花。这种光芒在星界精灵的眼中表现为星光闪耀。",
	"Because nothing ages in the Astral Plane, astral elves from that plane are thousands of years old, and their longevity gives them an unusual perspective on time. Some are prone to melancholy, while others display an absence of feeling. Many look for creative ways to occupy themselves. Whether they choose to live in quiet contemplation or strike out to explore the reaches of the multiverse, they tend to see things through the lens of time as having little or no meaning to them.": "因为在星界没有什么东西会变老，所以来自星界的精灵有几千年的历史，他们的长寿让他们对时间有不寻常的看法。有些人容易忧郁，而另一些人则表现出没有感觉。许多人寻找创造性的方法来占据自己。无论他们是选择生活在安静的沉思中，还是出去探索多元宇宙的范围，他们都倾向于通过时间的镜头来看待事物，认为这对他们没有什么意义。",

All aven have lean bodies with feathers ex-tending from their heads down to their shoulders.": "阿文有类似人类的身体、手臂和腿，以及鸟类的翅膀和头。在Naktamun发现了两种不同种类的阿文。一种有鹰或类似猎物的头，翅膀很短，可以快速飞行。另一个品种有一个朱鹭的头，长长的脖子，宽而有棱角的翅膀更适合于翱翔。所有这些鸟都有瘦小的身体，羽毛从头部一直延伸到肩部。",
	"Aven delight in flying above their foes, using their superior mobility to confound and outpace their opponents. They love soaring through the sky as well, though the Hekma limits their altitude. Like all people of Naktamun, they are grateful for the Hekma's protective magic, of course. But they keenly anticipate the hour when the God-Pharaoh will return and dissolve the veil, letting them fly without limit in the afterlife.": "阿文喜欢在他们的敌人上方飞行，利用他们优越的机动性来迷惑和超越他们的对手。他们也喜欢在天空中翱翔，尽管赫克马限制了他们的飞行高度。像所有Naktamun的人一样，他们当然感谢Hekma的保护性魔法。但他们热切地期待着神-法老回来的那一刻，解散面纱，让他们在来世无限制地飞行。",
	"Spellcasters are common among ibis-headed aven drawn to follow the teachings of Kefnet. Their physical resemblance to the god of knowledge is reflected in the metal discipline, focus, and confidence for which aven spellcasters are known. They wield magic of air, wind, and sometimes water to buffet their foes, enhance their own flight, and counter enemy attacks. Hawk-headed aven who follow the path of the mage are more likely to learn sand-based magic that can cloud the air, blast their foes, or bury enemies in living dunes.": "施法者在被吸引来追随凯弗内特教义的朱鹭头阿文中很常见。他们与知识之神的身体相似，反映在金属的纪律、专注和自信上，这也是阿文的法术师们所熟知的。他们挥舞着空气、风的魔法，有时也挥舞着水的魔法来打击他们的敌人，增强自己的飞行能力，并反击敌人的攻击。走法师之路的鹰头人更有可能学习以沙子为基础的魔法，这些魔法可以使空气混浊，爆炸他们的敌人，或将敌人埋在活的沙丘中。",
	"Hawk-headed aven are often drawn to master tech-niques of long-range combat, whether the javelin that is the preferred weapon of many, the bow, or other thrown weapons. Whatever weapon they use, aven hover and swoop in the air above the fray, seeking the opportune moment to strike in exactly the right place. In line with the teachings of the god of solidarity, they often fly in tight formations with other aven in their crops, supporting and protecting each other. Aven take great pride in the precision of their attacks, relying on their keen vision and superior vantage points. They view the sharp tip of a {@item javelin|phb} or {@item arrow|phb} as a symbol of their love for precision, and some initiates maintain carefully tended collections of spearheads or arrowheads.": "鹰头人经常被吸引到掌握远程战斗的技术，无论是许多人喜欢的标枪、弓，还是其他投掷武器。无论他们使用什么武器，阿文都会在战场上方的空中盘旋和俯冲，寻找合适的时机，在正确的地方进行攻击。根据团结之神的教诲，他们经常与其他阿文一起以紧密的队形飞行，相互支持和保护。阿文对其攻击的精确性感到非常自豪，这要依靠他们敏锐的眼光和优越的地理位置。他们把{@item javelin|phb}或{@item arrow|phb}的锋利尖端看作是他们对精确性的热爱的象征，一些入会者还精心保管着矛头或箭头的收藏。",
	"A relatively small number of aven of both varieties end up focusing on hand-to-hand combat. Even there, they use their ability to fly to great advantage, often swooping down on their foes from a great height. The speed and power of a blow from a diving aven can be utterly devastating, but such a strike poses a tremendous risk to the aven as well as the target. An aven who fails to pull up from the dive in time can suffer even worse injuries than the target of the attack. Aven often minimize this risk by hurling {@item javelin|phb|javelins} while they dive, then pulling up early after a successful throw.": "这两个品种中相对较少的精灵最终专注于手对手的战斗。即使在那里，他们也会利用自己的飞行能力来发挥巨大的优势，经常从很高的地方俯冲下来攻击他们的敌人。俯冲的阿文的速度和力量可以带来巨大的破坏力，但这种打击对阿文和目标都构成了巨大的风险。一个复仇者如果不能及时从俯冲中拉起，可能会遭受比攻击目标更严重的伤害。复仇者通常通过在下潜时投掷{@item javelin|phb|javelins}，然后在成功投掷后提前拉起，来减少这种风险。",
	"Following the example of Oketra, hawk-headed aven often focus on the techniques of long-range combat. Most prefer {@item javelin|phb|javelins}, but some are skilled with bows, {@item spear|phb|spears}, and {@item handaxe|phb|throwing axes}.": "以奥克拉为榜样，鹰头人常常专注于远程作战的技术。大多数人喜欢用（%0%），但也有一些人擅长用弓、（%1%）和（%2%）。",
	"A majority of ibis-headed aven, drawn to the teachings of Kefnet, specialize in spellcasting. They take great pride in all the qualities they share with the god of knowledge—not just their avian heads, but their quick wit, self-confidence, cunning, and spellcasting prowess.": "大多数朱雀头的阿文，被凯菲特的教义所吸引，专门从事法术研究。他们对自己与知识之神共享的所有品质感到非常自豪--不仅仅是他们的鸟头，还有他们的急智、自信、狡猾和法术能力。",
	"Neither bugs nor bears, bugbears are the hulking cousins of goblins and hobgoblins. With roots in the Feywild, early bugbears resided in hidden places, in hard-to-reach and shadowed spaces. Long ago and from out of the corner of your eye, they came to the Material Plane, urged to spread throughout the multiverse by the conquering god Maglubiyet. Centuries later, they still bear a fey gift for lurking just out of sight, and many of them have sneaked away from that god's influence.": "既不是虫子也不是熊，虫熊是地精和妖精的庞大表亲。早期的虫熊扎根于精灵世界，居住在隐蔽的地方，在难以触及的阴影空间。很久以前，从你的眼角余光中，他们来到了物质世界，被征服者马格卢比耶特神敦促着在整个多元宇宙传播。几个世纪后，他们仍然具有潜伏在视线之外的精灵天赋，他们中的许多人已经偷偷地离开了那位神的影响。",
	"They are long of limb and covered in coarse hair, with wedge-shaped ears and pointed teeth. Despite their formidable build, bugbears are quiet skulkers, thanks to a fey magic that allows them to hide in spaces seemingly too small for them.": "他们四肢修长，浑身长满粗毛，有楔形的耳朵和尖牙。尽管它们的身材很强壮，但虫熊是安静的潜行者，这要归功于一种精灵的魔法，它可以让它们藏在对它们来说似乎太小的空间里。",
	"In the sprawling city of Ravnica, where \"open road\" seems like a contradiction and \"open plain\" is sheer nonsense, centaurs nevertheless retain a love of wide spaces and the freedom to travel. As much as they can, centaurs run—in wide plazas, spacious parks, and expanses of rubble and ruin. They race the wind, hooves thundering and tails streaming behind them, until the next wall looms in their path and brings them to a stop.": "在Ravnica这个庞大的城市里，\"开放的道路 \"似乎是一个矛盾，而 \"开放的平原 \"则完全是无稽之谈，但半人马仍然对广阔的空间和自由的旅行充满了热爱。半人马尽可能地在宽阔的广场、宽敞的公园和大片的瓦砾和废墟中奔跑。他们与风赛跑，蹄声如雷，尾随其后，直到下一堵墙出现在他们的道路上，使他们停下来。",
	"Centaurs have the upper bodies, down to the waist, of muscular humans, displaying all the human variety of skin tones and features. Their ears are slightly pointed, but their faces are wider and squarer than those of elves. Below the waist, they have the bodies of small horses, with a similar range of coloration—from various shades of chestnut or bay to dappled or even zebra-like striped patterns. Most centaurs style their hair and their tails in a similar way. Selesnya centaurs favor long, flowing hair. Gruul centaurs cut their hair in rough, spiky styles.": "半人马的上半身，直到腰部，都是肌肉发达的人类，显示出所有人类的各种肤色和特征。他们的耳朵稍尖，但他们的脸比精灵更宽更方。腰部以下，他们有小马的身体，有类似的颜色范围--从各种深浅不一的栗色或海湾色到斑驳甚至斑马状的条纹图案。大多数半人马的头发和尾巴的样式都差不多。Selesnya半人马喜欢长而飘逸的头发。格鲁尔半人马将他们的头发剪成粗糙、尖锐的样式。",
	"The upper bodies of centaurs are comparable to human torsos in size, and their lower equine bodies average about 4 feet tall at the withers. Though they are smaller than a human rider mounted on a horse, they fill similar roles as cavalry warriors, messengers, outriders, and scouts.": "半人马的上半身与人类的躯干大小相当，其下半身的马身平均约有4英尺高，在肩部。虽然他们比骑在马上的人类骑手要小，但他们扮演着类似于骑兵战士、信使、逃兵和侦察兵的角色。",
	"Centaurs have an affinity for the natural world. Among the guilds that share that affinity, centaurs favor the rubblebelts of the Gruul Clans and the wide plazas of the Selesnya Conclave over the undercity tunnels of the Golgari and the laboratories of the Simic.": "半人马对自然世界有一种亲和力。在拥有这种亲和力的公会中，半人马更喜欢格鲁尔氏族的瓦砾地带和塞勒斯尼亚公会的宽阔广场，而不是戈尔加里的城市地下隧道和西米克的实验室。",
	"Centaurs celebrate life and growth, and the birth of a foal is always cause for festivities. At the same time, they revere the traditions of the past, and among both the Gruul and the Selesnya they are voices of memory and history, preserving old ways and keeping alive the legends of ancestral heroes. They feel a close kinship with wild animals, perhaps because of their own horse-like bodies, and delight in the feeling of running alongside herds and packs of other beasts.": "半人马庆祝生命和成长，小马驹的出生总是值得庆祝的。同时，他们崇尚过去的传统，在格鲁尔人和塞勒斯尼亚人中，他们是记忆和历史的代言人，保留着古老的方式，并使祖先的英雄传说得以延续。他们感到与野生动物有密切的亲属关系，也许是因为他们自己有像马一样的身体，并乐于与其他野兽的群落一起奔跑的感觉。",
	"Centaurs sense the interconnectedness of the natural world. Thus, they celebrate family and community as microcosms of that greater connection. Among the Gruul, they have a strong clan identity, and Selesnya centaurs are fiercely loyal to their individual communities as well as the guild as a whole. Their love of history and tradition also means that centaurs are more likely than most other Ravnicans to join the same guild that their parents did.": "半人马感觉到自然界的相互联系。因此，他们把家庭和社区作为这种更大联系的缩影来庆祝。在格鲁尔人中，他们有强烈的部族认同感，塞勒斯尼亚半人马对他们的个人社区以及整个公会都非常忠诚。他们对历史和传统的热爱也意味着半人马比其他大多数拉夫尼科人更有可能加入他们父母的同一个公会。",
	"Centaurs' given names are passed down through family lines. The name bestowed on a new foal is typically the name of the most recently deceased family member of the same gender, keeping alive the memory—and, the centaurs believe, some shard of the spirit—of the departed. Centaurs don't use family names, but they wear symbols that represent their family membership. These symbols might include graphical representations of plants or animals, printed mottoes, braids and beads worn in the hair and tail, or even specific patterns of woven fabric.": "半人马的名字是通过家族遗传下来的。赐予新马驹的名字通常是最近去世的同性别家庭成员的名字，以保持记忆--半人马认为，是离世者的一些精神碎片。半人马不使用姓氏，但他们佩戴代表其家族成员的符号。这些符号可能包括植物或动物的图形代表，印刷的座右铭，头发和尾巴上佩戴的辫子和珠子，甚至是编织的特定图案。",

	"Powerful and curious, quick to act and knowledgeable of the wider world, centaurs seek to experience life's boundless bounty. The centaurs of Theros are divided into two groups: members of the far-traveling Lagonna band and the proud raiders of the Pheres band. These bands occupy territories situated between the three major human poleis, making them common sights to those who travel human lands. Not ones to settle in permanent homes, though, centaurs might be found wherever there are wonders to be witnessed and adventures to be had.": "半人马力量强大，好奇心强，行动迅速，对更广阔的世界了如指掌，他们寻求体验生活的无尽恩惠。泰罗斯的半人马分为两组：远行的Lagonna部落成员和骄傲的Pheres部落突击队员。这些队伍占据着位于三个主要人类极地之间的领土，使他们成为那些在人类土地上旅行的人的常见风景。不过，半人马并不定居在永久的家园里，只要有奇迹可看，有冒险可做，就能找到他们。",
	"Though centaurs share the same basic physiology, the centaur bands are commonly associated with their own distinct traits.": "虽然半人马有相同的基本生理结构，但半人马带通常与他们自己的独特特征有关。",
	"Lagonna band centaurs tend to be sleek and muscular, with powerful legs built for endurance rather than speed. They usually have coats of a single color, often with a shine that can look metallic in bright light.": "拉戈纳带半人马往往是光滑的，肌肉发达的，有强大的腿，为耐力而不是速度而生。他们通常有单一颜色的外套，通常有一种光泽，在明亮的光线下看起来像金属。",
	"Pheres band centaurs typically have long, nimble legs and lean bodies, and are often marked with natural color patterns on their hide. Pheres centaurs sometimes paint or tattoo their upper bodies to match the patterns on their lower half. Occasionally, a Pheres centaur is born with vertical stripes on their hooves, foretelling an exciting and adventurous life.": "Pheres带半人马通常有长而灵活的腿和瘦小的身体，他们的皮上通常有天然的颜色图案。Pheres半人马有时会在上半身涂抹或刺青以配合下半身的图案。偶尔，佩雷斯半人马的蹄子上会有垂直的条纹，预示着他们会有一个令人兴奋和冒险的生活。",
	"Lagonna centaurs travel in small merchant family bands called {@i guri}.

	"The eldest member of each guros typically leads their family. In times of discord, the heads of the guri gather to make decisions together. Other members of the guros work as traders, gatherers, packers, and scouts. A guros has several specialized roles required for success in travel and trade: a barterer, an omener, a courser, and preferably a {@i koletra}.": "每个古里的最年长成员通常领导他们的家庭。在不和谐的时候，古里的首脑们会聚集在一起做出决定。古里人的其他成员担任商人、采集者、包装者和侦察员。在旅行和贸易中，一个古鲁斯人有几个专门的角色，这是在旅行和贸易中取得成功所需要的：一个讨价还价者，一个奥米纳，一个马夫，最好还有一个（%0%）。",
	"A barterer negotiates deals between the guros and other traders. Barterers must know the customs of other cultures and speak several different languages.": "易货商在古罗人和其他商人之间谈判交易。讨价还价者必须了解其他文化的习俗，并会说几种不同的语言。",
	"An omener is an oracle who reads messages from the gods in the natural world and reveals how the immortals would have the guros travel.": "预言家是一个神谕者，他从自然界的神灵那里读取信息，并揭示不朽者将如何让古罗斯旅行。",
	"A courser explores new trade territory for their guros. They are expert trackers and navigators, able to venture deep into unexplored territory and unerringly return to their families.": "马车夫为他们的古罗斯探索新的贸易领域。他们是专业的追踪者和导航员，能够深入到未开发的领域，并准确无误地返回到他们的家庭。",
	"Finally, every guros tries to travel with at least one koletra, one of the mighty, well-trained warriors of the Lagonna who are said to have the blood of the first, legendary centaur heroes. Koletras are said to bring good luck to a band, but are also usually fated to die in defense of their family. Not every guros has a koletra of its own, and guri share their best warriors among each other as a sign of goodwill and a way to forge bonds.": "最后，每个古罗斯人都试图与至少一个科勒特拉一起旅行，科勒特拉是拉贡人中强大的、训练有素的战士之一，据说他们拥有最早的、传说中的半人马英雄的血液。据说Koletras会给一个乐队带来好运，但通常也注定要为保卫自己的家庭而牺牲。并非每个古罗斯都有自己的科勒特拉，古里在彼此之间分享他们最好的战士，以示善意，也是建立联系的一种方式。",
	"When young Lagonna centaurs become adults, they often leave their band to travel the world on their own. This time of self-discovery, called a {@i protoporos}, can last anywhere from a few weeks to several years. The Lagonna believe that a protoporos helps young centaurs find their place in the world. An omener reads the signs of fortune before sending young centaurs on their way, guiding the first steps of their journey. While most centaurs return to the band eventually, some find their calling elsewhere. When the Lagonna tell tales of their greatest heroes, they often speak of centaurs who found their heroic destiny on a protoporos.": "当年轻的拉贡半人马成为成年人时，他们往往会离开他们的乐队，独自旅行到世界各地。这段自我发现的时间，称为（%0%），可以持续几周到几年。拉贡人认为，protoporos可以帮助年轻的半人马找到他们在这个世界上的位置。在送年轻的半人马上路之前，预言家会读出财富的迹象，指导他们迈出旅程的第一步。虽然大多数半人马最终都回到了乐队，但有些人却在其他地方找到了自己的使命。当拉贡人讲述他们最伟大的英雄故事时，他们经常说到半人马在protoporos上找到了他们的英雄命运。",
	"The Pheres roam the wild lands between Setessa and Akros in small raiding herds. These herds are voluntary associations, in contrast to the family groups of the Lagonna. When necessary, several small bands join together in a larger herd to target particularly dangerous but resource-rich targets—be they humanoid traders or roving, greedy monsters. Bands also join together to defeat common threats or to hunt for game.": "佩雷斯人在塞特萨和阿克罗斯之间的荒地上游荡，形成了小型的袭击群。这些族群是自愿组成的，与拉贡人的家族团体不同。在必要的时候，几个小族群会联合起来，组成一个更大的族群，瞄准特别危险但资源丰富的目标--无论是人形商人还是游荡的、贪婪的怪兽。队伍也会联合起来打败共同的威胁，或者猎取猎物。",
	"The Pheres value physical strength, speed, and prowess in both hunting and combat. Often a band is led by the strongest and most dominant warrior, called the charger. However, some bands elevate a tactician or strategist to this venerated position. The Pheres can be brutal and greedy, but they are clever as well, and understand the value of strategic leadership.": "佩雷斯人重视体力、速度，以及在狩猎和战斗中的能力。通常情况下，一支队伍由最强壮和最有统治力的战士领导，他被称为充军者。然而，有些部落将战术家或战略家提升到这个受人尊敬的位置。佩雷斯人可能很野蛮和贪婪，但他们也很聪明，并懂得战略领导的价值。",
	"Other centaurs in Pheres herds work as scouts, archers, warriors, and foragers. In addition, most Pheres herds contain a caller and a tromper.": "其他半人马在Pheres兽群中担任侦察兵、弓箭手、战士和觅食者。此外，大多数Pheres兽群中都有一个呼唤者和一个践踏者。",

	"Trompers are the most powerful and feared warriors of the herd. Centaur legends say that when the gods first fashioned humans from the red mud of the eldest river, Pheres trompers taught them how to corner and kill prey. The story tells that, to repay this debt, humans owe the centaurs a portion of what they catch. While humans don't recall this arrangement, the Pheres often cite it as justification for their raids.": "Trompers是兽群中最强大、最可怕的战士。半人马的传说说，当众神第一次从最古老的河流的红泥中塑造人类时，Pheres trompers教他们如何捕捉和杀死猎物。故事说，为了偿还这笔债务，人类欠半人马一部分他们捕获的东西。虽然人类不记得这个安排，但Pheres经常引用它作为他们袭击的理由。",
	"Pheres band members survive by working and fighting together, but still some centaurs choose to strike out on their own. These renegades often feel like outsiders in their own band. They might be pacifists, wishing to learn about other people rather than fighting them. Or they might feel a restlessness in their soul that nothing else can soothe. Though renegades build their own life away from the band, most retain some connection with their past. Some stories tell of renegades returning to help their band in times of need before disappearing once more.": "Pheres乐队成员通过一起工作和战斗而生存，但仍有一些半人马选择独立出击。这些叛逆者常常觉得自己在自己的乐队中是局外人。他们可能是和平主义者，希望了解其他人而不是与他们战斗。或者他们可能感到灵魂中的不安，没有什么可以抚慰。虽然叛逆者在远离乐队的地方建立了自己的生活，但大多数人都与他们的过去保持着某种联系。有些故事说，叛逆者在需要的时候会回来帮助他们的乐队，然后再一次消失。",

It is rare to see a changeling in that form, for a typical changeling changes their shape the way others might change clothes. A casual shape—one created on the spur of the moment, with no depth or history—is called a mask. A mask can be used to express a mood or to serve a specific purpose and then might never be used again. However, many changelings develop identities that have more depth.

	"In their true form, changelings appear faded, their features almost devoid of detail. It is rare to see a changeling in that form, for a typical changeling changes their shape the way others might change clothes.

	"To any dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect to their clan above all else, even the gods.

	"Dwarves can live to be more than 400 years old, so the oldest living dwarves often remember a very different world. For example, some of the oldest dwarves living in Citadel Felbarr (in the world of the Forgotten Realms) can recall the day, more than three centuries ago, when orcs conquered the fortress and drove them into an exile that lasted over 250 years. This longevity grants them a perspective on the world that shorter-lived races such as humans and halflings lack.": "矮人可以活到400岁以上，所以最年长的活着的矮人往往记得一个非常不同的世界。例如，一些生活在费尔巴尔城堡（Citadel Felbarr）的最年长的矮人可以回忆起三个多世纪前的那一天，兽人征服了这个要塞，并把他们赶到了一个持续了250多年的流放地。这种长寿赋予他们对世界的看法，这是人类和半身人等寿命较短的种族所缺乏的。",

	"Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, sometimes to the point of stubbornness. Many dwarves have a strong sense of justice, and they are slow to forget wrongs they have suffered. A wrong done to one dwarf is a wrong done to the dwarf's entire clan, so what begins as one dwarf's hunt for vengeance can become a full-blown clan feud.": "个别矮人坚定而忠诚，言而有信，行动果断，有时甚至到了固执的程度。许多矮人有强烈的正义感，他们对自己遭受的错误迟迟不能忘怀。对一个矮人所做的错事就是对这个矮人的整个部族所做的错事，所以开始时只是一个矮人的复仇行动可能会变成一个全面的部族争斗。",
	"Dwarven kingdoms stretch deep beneath the mountains where the dwarves mine gems and precious metals and forge items of wonder. They love the beauty and artistry of precious metals and fine jewelry, and in some dwarves this love festers into avarice. Whatever wealth they can't find in their mountains, they gain through trade. They dislike boats, so enterprising humans and halflings frequently handle trade in dwarven goods along water routes. Trustworthy members of other races are welcome in dwarf settlements, though some areas are off limits even to them.": "矮人王国延伸到山下深处，在那里，矮人开采宝石和贵重金属，锻造神奇的物品。他们热爱贵金属和高级珠宝的美感和艺术性，而在一些矮人身上，这种热爱会发酵成贪婪。无论他们在自己的山里找不到什么财富，他们都会通过贸易获得。他们不喜欢船，所以有进取心的人类和半身人经常沿着水路处理矮人货物的贸易。矮人定居点欢迎值得信赖的其他种族成员，尽管有些地区甚至对他们来说是禁区。",
	"The chief unit of dwarven society is the clan, and dwarves highly value social standing.

	"Dwarves who take up the adventuring life might be motivated by a desire for treasure-for its own sake, for a specific purpose, or even out of an altruistic desire to help others. Other dwarves are driven by the command or inspiration of a deity, a direct calling or simply a desire to bring glory to one of the dwarf gods. Clan and ancestry are also important motivators. A dwarf might seek to restore a clan's lost honor, avenge an ancient wrong the clan suffered, or earn a new place within the clan after having been exiled. Or a dwarf might search for the axe wielded by a mighty ancestor, lost on the field of battle centuries ago.": "开始冒险生活的矮人可能是出于对宝藏的渴望--为了它本身，为了一个特定的目的，甚至是出于帮助他人的利他主义愿望。其他矮人则是受神灵的命令或灵感驱使，是一种直接的召唤，或者仅仅是为了给某个矮人神灵带来荣耀的愿望。部族和祖先也是重要的动机。矮人可能会寻求恢复一个部族失去的荣誉，为部族遭受的古老错误复仇，或者在被流放后在部族中获得新的地位。或者一个矮人可能会寻找一个强大的祖先所挥舞的斧头，这个斧头在几个世纪前的战场上丢失了。",
	"Dwarves get along passably well with most other races. \"The difference between an acquaintance and a friend is about a hundred years,\" is a dwarf saying that might be hyperbole, but certainly points to how difficult it can be for a member of a short-lived race like humans to earn a dwarf's trust.": "矮人与大多数其他种族相处得相当好。\"一个熟人和一个朋友之间的区别大约是一百年。\"这是矮人的一句话，可能是夸张，但肯定指出了像人类这样短命的种族成员要赢得矮人的信任有多难。",

Not as good as a dwarf, maybe, but no doubt they hate the orcs as much as we do.\"": "\"依赖精灵是不明智的。不知道精灵下一步会做什么；当锤子碰到兽人的头时，他们很可能开始唱歌，就像拔出剑一样。他们善于逃跑，而且很轻浮。不过，有两件事要为他们说。他们的铁匠不多，但他们的铁匠做得非常好。当兽人或地精从山中涌出时，精灵是你的好帮手。也许不如矮人好，但毫无疑问，他们和我们一样讨厌兽人。\"",

The other type (including the high elves of Greyhawk, the Qualinesti of Dragonlance, and the moon elves of the Forgotten Realms) are more common and more friendly, and often encountered among humans and other races.": "作为一个高等精灵，你有敏锐的头脑，至少掌握了基本的魔法。在D&D的许多世界中，有两种高等精灵。一种类型（包括灰鹰的灰精灵和山谷精灵、龙之谷的希尔瓦娜斯蒂和被遗忘的王国的太阳精灵）是傲慢的、隐居的，认为自己比非精灵甚至其他精灵更优越。另一种类型（包括灰鹰的高精灵、龙之谷的奎林斯蒂和被遗忘的领域的月精灵）更常见、更友好，经常在人类和其他种族中遇到。",
	"The sun elves of Faerun (also called gold elves or sunrise elves) have bronze skin and hair of copper, black, or golden blond. Their eyes are golden, silver, or black. Moon elves (also called silver elves or gray elves) are much paler, with alabaster skin sometimes tinged with blue. They often have hair of silver-white, black, or blue, but various shades of blond, brown, and red are not uncommon. Their eyes are blue or green and flecked with gold.": "法隆的太阳精灵（也被称为黄金精灵或日出精灵）拥有古铜色的皮肤和铜色、黑色或金色的头发。他们的眼睛是金色、银色或黑色。月亮精灵（也被称为银色精灵或灰色精灵）要苍白得多，雪花石般的皮肤有时会染上蓝色。他们通常有银白色、黑色或蓝色的头发，但各种深浅不一的金色、棕色和红色也不罕见。他们的眼睛是蓝色或绿色的，并带有金色的斑点。",
	"Sea elves fell in love with the wild beauty of the ocean in the earliest days of the multiverse. While other elves traveled from realm to realm, the sea elves navigated the deepest currents and explored the waters across a hundred worlds. Today, they live in small, hidden communities in the ocean shallows and on the Elemental Plane of Water.": "在多元宇宙的早期，海精灵就爱上了海洋的狂野之美。当其他精灵从一个境界到另一个境界时，海精灵在最深的洋流中航行，并在一百个世界中探索水域。今天，他们生活在海洋浅滩和水元素位面的小型隐秘社区中。",
	"The sea elves face as many perils in their watery world as other elves face on dry land, but none are as deadly as the sahuagin. The animosity between these two races stems from the sahuagin's ferocious territoriality. They simply won't abide any other intelligent society, and they consider the entire sea to be their domain.": "海精灵在他们的水世界中面临的危险和其他精灵在干地上面临的危险一样多，但没有人像萨瓦金人那样致命。这两个种族之间的敌意源于萨瓦金人凶猛的领土意识。他们根本不会容忍任何其他的智能社会，他们认为整个海洋都是他们的领域。",
	"Adding to the tension, the sahuagin worship Sekolah, the shark god, while Deep Sashelas, the sea deity of the elves, is a sworn enemy of all sharks. But even if the sea elves inexplicably began worshiping Sekolah, the sahuagin still wouldn't be able to get along with them-in the grip of a blood frenzy, sahuagin will tear apart even others of their own kind!": "更加紧张的是，萨瓦金人崇拜鲨鱼之神Sekolah，而海精灵的海神Deep Sashelas则是所有鲨鱼的死敌。但是，即使海精灵莫名其妙地开始崇拜塞科拉，萨瓦金人仍然无法与他们相处--在血液狂热的控制下，萨瓦金人甚至会撕碎自己的同类!",
	"Sworn to the Raven Queen's service, the mysterious shadar-kai venture into the Material Plane from the Shadowfell to advance her will. Once they were fey like the rest of their elven kin, and now they exist in a strange state between life and death. Eladrin and shadar-kai are like reflections of each other: one bursting with emotion, the other nearly devoid of it.": "发誓为乌鸦女王服务，神秘的沙达凯人从暗影城冒险进入物质世界，以推进她的意志。他们曾经和其他的精灵亲属一样是精灵，而现在他们以一种奇怪的状态存在于生与死之间。Eladrin和Shadar-kai就像彼此的反射：一个迸发着情感，另一个几乎没有情感。",
	"As a wood elf, you have keen senses and intuition, and your fleet feet carry you quickly and stealthily through your native forests. This category includes the wild elves (grugach) of Greyhawk and the Kagonesti of Dragonlance, as well as the races called wood elves in Greyhawk and the Forgotten Realms. In Faerun, wood elves (also called wild elves, green elves, or forest elves) are reclusive and distrusting of non-elves.": "作为一个木精灵，你有敏锐的感觉和直觉，你的脚步迅速而隐蔽地穿过你的原生森林。这一类别包括灰鹰的野生精灵（grugach）和龙之谷的Kagonesti，以及灰鹰和被遗忘的领域中被称为木精灵的种族。在法云（Faerun），木精灵（也称为野生精灵、绿色精灵或森林精灵）是隐居的，对非精灵不信任。",
	"Wood elves' skin tends to be copperish in hue, sometimes with traces of green. Their hair tends toward browns and blacks, but it is occasionally blond or copper-colored. Their eyes are green, brown, or hazel.": "木精灵的皮肤往往是铜色的，有时还带有绿色的痕迹。他们的头发倾向于棕色和黑色，但偶尔也有金色或铜色的。他们的眼睛是绿色、棕色或淡褐色的。",
	"Elves are a fearless and adaptable people. They have fared better than most in the tumultuous environment of Zendikar, and many have reacted to the reappearance of the Eldrazi with resilience and courage. They remain the most prevalent race on Murasa, and have a strong presence in other regions as well. Their treetop villages seem to regrow almost as soon as they are destroyed—much like the Murasan jungles where they are found.": "精灵是一个无所畏惧、适应性强的民族。他们在赞迪卡的动荡环境中比大多数人表现得更好，许多人以坚韧和勇气应对了埃尔德拉兹的重新出现。他们仍然是穆拉萨最普遍的种族，并且在其他地区也有很强的存在感。他们的树顶村庄似乎在被摧毁后就会重新生长--就像他们所在的穆拉萨丛林。",
	"Elves are strongly associated with green mana, the magic that flows through their forest homes. Their shamans and druids channel this magic of life and growth, communing with the land or the spirits of the departed. Striving to live in harmony with nature, they celebrate the ties between their communities and their connection with the broader world around them.": "精灵与绿色法力密切相关，绿色法力是流经他们森林家园的魔法。他们的巫师和德鲁伊引导着这种生命和成长的魔法，与土地或逝者的灵魂进行交流。他们努力与自然和谐相处，庆祝他们社区之间的联系以及他们与周围更广泛的世界的联系。",
	"Elves are about as tall as humans, but are more slender. Their legs are long, and their pointed ears sweep back from their heads. They move gracefully and hold themselves with elegant poise, but they are a people of the woodlands, and their life in the wilds is manifested in the practical simplicity of their clothes and equipment. Never ones to waste anything that can be reused, elves stitch torn garments together into new ones, and transform broken sword blades into useful gear. They prefer leather for protection rather than metal, which they use to craft swords, spears, arrowheads, and climbing hooks.": "精灵与人类差不多高，但更加苗条。他们的腿很长，尖尖的耳朵从头上向后掠过。他们行动优雅，举止优雅，但他们是林地的居民，他们在荒野中的生活体现在他们的衣服和设备的实用性上。精灵们从不浪费任何可以再利用的东西，他们将破损的衣服缝合成新的衣服，并将破损的剑刃变成有用的装备。他们更喜欢用皮革而不是金属来保护自己，他们用皮革来制作剑、长矛、箭头和攀岩钩。",
	"The elves of the imperious Joraga nation of Bala Ged have little respect for any other race of Zendikar—or even for other elves. The survival of their nation and its traditions is the Joraga elves' only goal, and they view the influence of others as a weakness. The Joraga eschew the goods and habits of others, even avoiding the pathways blazed by the Tajuru when possible. Many view the nomadic Joraga clans as little more than bands of roving murderers, but a complex culture hides behind those clans' aggressive exterior.": "巴拉格德的乔拉加帝国的精灵们很少尊重赞迪卡的任何其他种族，甚至是其他精灵。他们的国家和传统的生存是乔拉加精灵的唯一目标，他们认为其他人的影响是一种弱点。乔拉格人避开了其他人的商品和习惯，甚至在可能的情况下避开塔吉鲁人开辟的道路。许多人认为游牧的乔拉加氏族不过是一群游荡的杀人犯，但在这些氏族咄咄逼人的外表下，隐藏着复杂的文化。",
	"Elves of the Mul Daya nation of Bala Ged are set apart from other elves by their relationship with the spirits of their elven ancestors. To the Mul Daya, the spirit world and the mortal realm are different only in terms of their tangibility. Death and the spirits of the dead are as much a part of the lives of the Mul Daya as is the natural world. This is not a macabre sentiment to the elves; they simply view it as the truest sense of the natural order.": "Bala Ged的Mul Daya民族的精灵因其与精灵祖先的灵魂的关系而与其他精灵不同。对穆尔达雅人来说，精神世界和凡人领域的区别只在于它们的可触性。死亡和亡灵与自然界一样是穆尔达雅人生活的一部分。这对精灵们来说并不是一种可怕的情绪；他们只是把它看作是自然秩序最真实的意义。",
	"Mul Daya elves can often be recognized by their face painting and tattooing. Many Mul Daya decorate their skins with an enwrapping vine motif, and make use of poisons and acids collected at great cost from strange creatures and plants in the depths of Kazandu.": "Mul Daya精灵通常可以通过他们的面部绘画和纹身来识别。许多穆尔达雅人用缠绕的藤蔓图案来装饰自己的皮肤，并利用从卡赞杜深处的奇怪生物和植物中花大价钱收集的毒药和酸。",
	"The Tajuru nation is the largest of the three main elven nations, concentrated in Murasa and spread across other parts of Zendikar as hundreds of far-flung clans. Tajuru elves are the most open to people of other races, seeing their skills and perspectives as valuable new tools for survival. The Tajuru are also more open to new lifestyles, be it living in a mountaintop citadel or roaming grassy plains.": "塔吉鲁民族是三个主要的精灵民族中最大的一个，集中在穆拉萨，并以数百个遥远的部族的形式分布在赞迪卡的其他地方。塔吉鲁精灵对其他种族的人最为开放，将他们的技能和观点视为宝贵的新生存工具。塔吉鲁人对新的生活方式也更加开放，无论是住在山顶的城堡里，还是在草地上漫游。",
	"The Feywild is home to many fantastic peoples, including fairies. Fairies are a wee folk, but not nearly as much so as their pixie and sprite friends. The first fairies spoke Elvish, Goblin, or Sylvan, and encounters with human visitors prompted many of them to learn Common as well.": "仙境是许多神奇民族的家园，包括仙女。仙女是一种微不足道的民俗，但还不如他们的精灵和妖怪朋友。最早的仙女说的是精灵语、妖精语或希尔凡语，而与人类访客的相遇促使她们中的许多人也学会了普通话。",
	"Infused with the magic of the Feywild, most fairies look like Small elves with insectile wings, but each fairy has a special physical characteristic that sets the fairy apart. For your fairy, roll on the Fey Characteristics table or choose an option from it. You're also free to come up with your own characteristic if none of the suggestions below fit your character.": "融入了精灵世界的魔力，大多数仙女看起来就像长着昆虫翅膀的小精灵，但每个仙女都有一个特殊的身体特征，使仙女与众不同。对于你的仙女，请在仙女特征表上滚动，或从中选择一个选项。如果下面的建议都不适合你的角色，你也可以自由地想出你自己的特征。",

	"Your legs are insectile.": "你的腿是虫子的。",
	"You smell like fresh brownies.": "你闻起来像新鲜的巧克力蛋糕。",
	"A noticeable, harmless chill surrounds you.": "一种明显的、无害的寒意包围着你。",
	"The Feywild is home to many fantastic peoples, including fairies. Fairies are a wee folk, but not nearly as much so as their pixie and sprite friends.": "仙境是许多神奇民族的家园，包括仙女。仙女是一种微不足道的民俗，但还不如他们的精灵和妖怪朋友。",
	"Infused with the magic of the Feywild, fairies share a few commonalities with one another but can differ widely in appearance, behavior, and attitude. Many fairies have a special physical characteristic that sets them apart from other creatures of their kind. For your fairy, roll on the Fey Characteristic table or choose an option from it. The Feywild is a wild place, so come up with your own characteristic if none of these fit your character.": "仙女被注入了精灵世界的魔力，她们彼此之间有一些共同点，但在外观、行为和态度上却有很大的不同。许多仙女有一个特殊的身体特征，使她们与其他同类生物不同。对于你的仙女，请在仙女特征表上滚动，或从其中选择一个选项。仙界是一个狂野的地方，所以如果这些都不适合你的角色，请想出你自己的特征。",
	"You have small wings like those of an insect.": "你有像昆虫一样的小翅膀。",
	"A constant, glittering mist surrounds you.": "持续的、闪亮的雾气围绕着你。",
	"Your hands never look dirty.": "你的手看起来从来都不脏。",
	"Distant cousins of giants, the first firbolgs wandered the primeval forests of the multiverse, and the magic of those forests entwined itself with the firbolgs' souls. Centuries later, that magic still thrums inside a firbolg, even one who has never lived under the boughs of a great forest.": "作为巨人的远房亲戚，第一批枞树人在多元宇宙的原始森林中游荡，那些森林的魔力与枞树人的灵魂纠缠在一起。几个世纪后，这种魔力仍然在枞树人体内激荡，即使是那些从未在大森林的树枝下生活过的人。",
	"A firbolg's magic is an obscuring sort, which allowed their ancestors to pass through a forest without disturbing it. So deep is the connection between a firbolg and the wild places of the world that they can communicate with flora and fauna.": "枞树的魔法是一种遮蔽性的魔法，它使他们的祖先能够通过森林而不干扰它。枞树人与世界上的野地之间的联系是如此之深，以至于他们可以与动植物沟通。",
	"Firbolgs can live up to 500 years.": "枞树的寿命可以达到500年。",
	"Firbolg tribes cloister in remote forest strongholds, preferring to spend their days in quiet harmony with the woods. When provoked, firbolgs demonstrate formidable skills with weapons and druidic magic.": "枞树部落隐居在偏远的森林据点中，更喜欢与森林安静和谐地度过每一天。当被激怒时，枞树人就会展现出强大的武器和德鲁伊魔法技能。",
	"Firbolgs love nothing more than a peaceful day spent among the trees of an old forest. They see forests as sacred places, representing the heart of the world and monuments to the durability of life.": "枞树人最喜欢的是在古老森林的树木间度过的宁静日子。他们把森林看作是神圣的地方，代表着世界的心脏和生命的持久性的纪念碑。",
	"In their role as caretakers, firbolgs live off the land while striving to remain in balance with nature. Their methods reflect common sense and remarkable resourcefulness. During a bountiful summer, they store away excess nuts, fruit, and berries. When winter arrives, they scatter everything they can spare to ensure the animals of the wood survive until springtime.": "作为看护者，枞树人以土地为生，同时努力保持与大自然的平衡。他们的方法反映了常识和非凡的足智多谋。在丰收的夏季，他们把多余的坚果、水果和浆果储存起来。当冬天来临的时候，他们把所有能用的东西都撒出去，以确保森林里的动物能生存到春天。",
	"In a firbolg's eyes, there is no greater fault than greed. The firbolgs believe that the world remains healthiest when each creature takes only what it needs. Material goods, especially precious gems and gold, have little appeal to them. What use are such things when winter lingers and food runs short?": "在枞树人的眼中，没有比贪婪更大的错误了。枞树人相信，当每个生物只取其所需时，世界就会保持最健康。物质产品，特别是珍贵的宝石和黄金，对他们没有什么吸引力。当冬天来临，食物短缺的时候，这些东西有什么用？",
	"Firbolgs have a talent for druidic magic. Their cultural reverence for nature, combined with their strong and insightful minds, makes learning such magic an instinctive part of their development. Almost every firbolg learns a few spells, typically those used to mask their presence, and many go on to master nature magic.": "弗尔博格人有德鲁伊魔法的天赋。他们对自然的文化敬畏，加上他们强大而有洞察力的头脑，使得学习这种魔法成为他们发展的本能。几乎每个枞树人都会学习一些法术，通常是用来掩盖他们的存在，许多人还会继续掌握自然魔法。",
	"Firbolgs who become druids serve as stronghold leaders. With every action the tribe takes, the druids weigh not only the group's needs, but the effect each action will have on the forest and the rest of the natural world. Firbolg tribes would rather go hungry than strain the land during a famine.": "成为德鲁伊的枞树人担任据点领袖。在部落采取的每一个行动中，德鲁伊不仅要权衡群体的需求，还要权衡每个行动对森林和自然界其他地方的影响。枞树部落宁愿挨饿，也不愿在饥荒中使土地紧张。",
	"Most firbolgs are druids, rangers, or fighters. Among their kind, these vocations are passed down from one generation to the next. The firbolgs' magical heritage also expresses itself in other ways; those who become bards preserve the clan's lore, and firbolg sorcerers defend their communities. Firbolg wizards arise when a clan becomes friendly with elves.": "大多数枞树人是德鲁伊、游侠或战士。在他们的同类中，这些职业是代代相传的。菲尔博格人的魔法遗产也以其他方式表现出来；那些成为吟游诗人的人保存着氏族的传说，而菲尔博格的巫师则保卫着他们的社区。当一个部族与精灵友好相处时，就会出现菲尔波尔格巫师。",
	"Firbolg rogues are typically scouts tasked with spying on neighboring folk to determine their intentions. They are most common among firbolgs whose homes border human settlements.": "枞树流氓通常是侦察兵，他们的任务是监视附近的居民以确定他们的意图。他们在家园与人类居住区相邻的枞树人中最为常见。",
	"Firbolg barbarians are rare except among clans that face constant threats from evil humanoids and other invaders.": "除了在面临邪恶的人形生物和其他入侵者的持续威胁的部族中，菲尔波尔格野蛮人是罕见的。",
	"Firbolg clerics and paladins are usually dedicated to nature gods and are seen as enforcers of that god's will.": "菲尔博格的牧师和圣骑士通常献给自然神，被视为该神意志的执行者。",
	"Firbolg warlocks are rare, but some clans forge alliances and arcane pacts with powerful fey beings.": "枞树族的术士很罕见，但有些部族与强大的费伊人建立了联盟和奥秘的契约。",
	"Firbolg monks are almost entirely unheard of, though a monastery might take in the young survivors of a devastated firbolg clan.": "枞树和尚几乎是闻所未闻的，尽管一个寺院可能会收留一个遭到破坏的枞树部族的年轻幸存者。",
	"As caretakers of the land, firbolgs prefer to remain out of sight and out of mind. They don't try to dominate nature, but rather seek to ensure that it prospers and survives according to its own laws.": "作为土地的看守者，枞树人更喜欢躲在看不见的地方，不被人注意。他们不试图主宰自然，而是寻求确保自然按照自己的规律繁荣和生存。",
	"Firbolgs use their magic to keep their presence in a forest secret. This approach allows them to avoid the politics and struggles of elves, humans, and orcs. Such events concern the firbolgs only when the events affect the forest.": "枞树人使用他们的魔法来保持他们在森林中的秘密。这种方法使他们能够避免精灵、人类和兽人的政治和斗争。只有当事件影响到森林的时候，这些事件才会与枞树人有关。",
	"Even in the face of an intrusion, firbolgs prefer a subtle, gentle approach to prevent damage to their territory. They employ their magic to make the forest an unappealing place to explore by temporarily diverting springs, driving away game, stealing critical tools, and altering trails to leave hunting or lumber parties hopelessly lost. The firbolgs' presence is marked by an absence of animals and a strange quiet, as if the forest wishes to avoid attracting attention to itself. The faster travelers decide to move on, the better.": "即使面对入侵，枞树蛙也喜欢用一种微妙、温和的方式来防止对其领地的破坏。它们用自己的魔法使森林成为一个不吸引人的地方，临时改变泉水的流向，驱赶猎物，偷窃重要的工具，并改变小路，使狩猎或伐木队无望地迷路。枞树人的存在以没有动物和奇怪的安静为标志，似乎森林希望避免引起人们的注意。旅行者越快决定继续前进越好。",
	"If these tactics fail, the firbolgs take more direct action. Their observations of a settlement determine what happens next. If the outsiders seem peaceful, the firbolgs approach and gently ask them to leave, even offering food and other supplies to aid their departure. If those who insist on remaining respect nature, take only what they need, and live in harmony with the wood, firbolgs explore the possibility of friendship with them, as long as the outsiders vow to safeguard the forest. If the settlers clearly display evil intentions, however, the firbolgs martial their strength and magic for a single overwhelming attack.": "如果这些策略失败了，枞树会采取更直接的行动。他们对一个定居点的观察决定了接下来会发生什么。如果外来者看起来很平静，枞树人就会接近并温和地要求他们离开，甚至提供食物和其他用品帮助他们离开。如果那些坚持留下的人尊重自然，只拿他们需要的东西，并与森林和谐相处，枞树人就会探索与他们建立友谊的可能性，只要这些外来者发誓要保护森林。然而，如果定居者明显表现出邪恶的意图，枞树人就会调集他们的力量和魔法进行一次压倒性的攻击。",
	"As guardians of the wood, few firbolgs would dream of leaving their homes or attempting to fit into human society. An exiled firbolg, or one whose clan has been destroyed, might not have a choice in the matter. Most adventuring firbolgs fall into this latter category.": "作为森林的守护者，很少有枞树人会梦想离开自己的家园或试图融入人类社会。一个被流放的枞树，或者一个被摧毁的氏族，在这个问题上可能没有选择。大多数冒险的枞树人都属于这后一种类型。",
	"Outcast firbolgs can never return home. They committed some unforgivable deed, usually something that put their homeland at risk, such as starting a forest fire or killing a rare or beautiful wild creature. These firbolgs are loners who wander the world in hope of finding a new place to call home.": "被抛弃的枞树人永远不能回家了。他们犯下了一些不可饶恕的行为，通常是使他们的家园处于危险之中，例如引发森林大火或杀死稀有或美丽的野生生物。这些枞树人是独行侠，在世界范围内游荡，希望能找到一个新的地方作为家园。",
	"Orphaned firbolgs are those whose clans or home lands have been destroyed. They become crusaders for nature, seeking to avenge their loss and prevent the further destruction of the natural world.": "孤儿枞树是那些其家族或家乡被摧毁的人。他们成为自然界的十字军，寻求为他们的损失报仇，并防止自然界的进一步破坏。",
	"A few rare firbolgs are entrusted by their clan with an important mission that takes them beyond their homes. These firbolgs feel like pilgrims in a strange land, and usually they wish only to complete their quests and return home as quickly as possible.": "少数罕见的枞树人被他们的部族委托执行一项重要的任务，使他们超越了自己的家园。这些枞树人感觉自己就像一个陌生土地上的朝圣者，通常他们只希望尽快完成他们的任务并返回家园。",
	"The Firbolg Adventurers table can serve as inspiration for determining why a firbolg character leaves home.": "枞树冒险家表可以作为确定枞树角色为何离家的灵感。",

	"Personal quest ordained by omens": "由预兆决定的个人追求",
	"Dispatched on a quest by tribe leaders": "被部落首领派遣去执行任务",
	"Firbolg adopt elven names when they must deal with outsiders, although the concept of names strikes them as strange. They know the animals and plants of the forest without formal names, and instead identify the forest's children by their deeds, habits, and other actions.": "当他们必须与外人打交道时，菲尔波尔格会采用精灵族的名字，尽管名字的概念让他们感到很奇怪。他们认识森林中的动物和植物，但没有正式的名字，而是通过他们的行为、习惯和其他行动来识别森林中的孩子。",
	"By the same token, their tribe names merely refer to their homes. When dealing with other races, firbolgs refer to their lands by whatever name the surrounding folk use, as a matter of tact and hospitality, but among their own kind they simply call it \"home.\" Sometimes firbolgs adopt the nicknames or titles outsiders give them under the assumption that those who need names can call them whatever they wish.": "同样的道理，他们的部落名称只是指他们的家园。当与其他种族打交道时，菲尔波尔人用周围人使用的任何名字来称呼他们的土地，这是一种策略和好客，但在他们自己的同类中，他们只是称它为 \"家\"。有时，枞树人采用外人给他们起的绰号或头衔，认为那些需要名字的人可以随心所欲地称呼他们。",
	"Those who think of other planes at all consider them remote, distant realms, but planar influence can be felt throughout the world. It sometimes manifests in beings who, through an accident of birth, carry the power of the planes in their blood. The genasi are one such people, the offspring of genies and mortals.": "那些想到其他星球的人认为它们是遥远的、偏僻的领域，但星球的影响在全世界都能感觉到。它有时表现在那些由于出生时的意外而在血液中携带星球的力量的人身上。吉纳西就是这样的人，是精灵和凡人的后代。",
	"The Elemental Planes are often inhospitable to natives of the Material Plane: crushing earth, searing flames, boundless skies, and endless seas make visiting these places dangerous for even a short time. The powerful genies, however, do not face such troubles when venturing into the mortal world. They adapt well to the mingled elements of the Material Plane, and they sometimes visit whether of their own volition or compelled by magic. Some genies can adopt mortal guise and travel incognito.": "元素界对物质界的人来说往往是不友好的：破碎的土地、灼热的火焰、无边的天空和无尽的海洋，使得访问这些地方即使是短时间也很危险。然而，强大的精灵在进入凡人世界时不会面临这样的麻烦。他们能很好地适应物质世界的混合元素，而且他们有时会出于自愿或受魔法蛊惑而访问。有些精灵可以化身为凡人，隐姓埋名地旅行。",
	"During these visits, a mortal might catch a genies eye. Friendship forms, romance blooms, and sometimes children result. These children are genasi: individuals with ties to two worlds, yet belonging to neither. Some genasi are born of mortal-genie unions, others have two genasi as parents, and a rare few have a genie further up their family tree, manifesting an elemental heritage that's lain dormant for generations.": "在这些访问中，凡人可能会吸引精灵的目光。友谊的形成，浪漫的绽放，有时还会产生孩子。这些孩子是精灵：与两个世界有联系的人，但不属于任何一个世界。有些精灵是由凡人和精灵结合而生，有些精灵的父母是两个精灵，还有极少数的精灵在他们的家谱上有更高的地位，表现出世代沉睡的元素遗产。",
	"Occasionally, genasi result from exposure to a surge of elemental power, through phenomena such as an eruption from the Inner Planes or a planar convergence. Elemental energy saturates any creatures in the area and might alter their nature enough that their offspring with other mortals are born as genasi.": "偶尔，基因人也会因为暴露在元素力量的激增下而产生，比如内层世界的喷发或星球融合等现象。元素能量饱和了该地区的任何生物，并可能改变他们的本性，以至于他们与其他凡人的后代生来就是基因人。",
	"Genasi inherit something from both sides of their dual nature. They resemble humans but have unusual skin color (red, green, blue, or gray), and there is something odd about them. The elemental blood flowing through their veins manifests differently in each genasi, often as magical power.": "Genasi继承了他们双重性质的一些东西。他们与人类相似，但有不寻常的皮肤颜色（红色、绿色、蓝色或灰色），而且他们身上有一些奇怪的东西。流淌在他们血管中的元素血液在每个基因人身上的表现都不一样，往往是魔法的力量。",
	"Seen in silhouette, a genasi can usually pass for human. Those of earth or water descent tend to be heavier, while those of air or fire tend to be lighter. A given genasi might have some features reminiscent of the mortal parent (pointed ears from an elf, a stockier frame and thick hair from a dwarf, small hands and feet from a halfling, exceedingly large eyes from a gnome, and so on).": "从轮廓上看，精灵族人通常可以与人类相媲美。土系或水系血统的人往往比较重，而气系或火系的人则比较轻。一个特定的基因人可能有一些让人联想到凡人父母的特征（精灵的尖耳朵，矮人的粗壮身躯和浓密的头发，半身人的小手和小脚，地精的超大眼睛，等等）。",
	"Genasi almost never have contact with their elemental parents. Genies seldom have interest in their mortal offspring, seeing them as accidents. Many feel nothing for their genasi children at all.": "Genasi几乎从未与他们的元素父母接触过。精灵很少对他们的凡人后代感兴趣，把他们视为意外。许多人对他们的精灵孩子根本没有感觉。",
	"Some genasi live as outcasts, driven into exile for their unsettling appearance and strange magic, or assuming leadership of savage humanoids and weird cults in untamed lands. Others gain positions of great influence, especially where elemental beings are revered. A few genasi leave the Material Plane to find refuge in the households of their genie parents.": "一些基因人作为弃儿生活，因为他们令人不安的外表和奇怪的魔法而被流放，或者在未开化的土地上担任野蛮人和怪异邪教的领导。其他人则获得了具有巨大影响力的职位，尤其是在元素生物受到尊敬的地方。少数精灵离开物质世界，在其精灵父母的家庭中寻找庇护。",
	"Genasi rarely lack confidence, seeing themselves as equal to almost any challenge in their path. This certainty might manifest as graceful self-assurance in one genasi and as arrogance in another. Such self-confidence can sometimes blind genasi to risk, and their great plans often get them and others into trouble.": "基纳西人很少缺乏自信，他们认为自己几乎可以应对他们道路上的任何挑战。这种自信在一个Genasi身上可能表现为优雅的自我肯定，在另一个Genasi身上则表现为傲慢。这种自信有时会使玄武门人对风险视而不见，他们的伟大计划常常使他们和其他人陷入困境。",
	"Too much failure can chip away at even a genasis sense of self, so they constantly push themselves to improve, honing their talents and perfecting their craft.": "太多的失败会削弱甚至是一种自我意识，所以他们不断地促使自己改进，磨练自己的才能，完善自己的技艺。",
	"As rare beings, genasi might go their entire lives without encountering another one of their kind. There are no great genasi cities or empires. Genasi seldom have communities of their own and typically adopt the cultures and societies into which they are born. The more strange their appearance, the harder time they have. Many genasi lose themselves in teeming cities, where their distinctiveness hardly raises an eyebrow in places accustomed to a variety of different people.": "作为罕见的生命，genasi可能在一生中都不会遇到另一个他们的同类。没有伟大的Genasi城市或帝国。Genasi很少有自己的社区，通常采用他们出生时的文化和社会。他们的外表越是奇怪，他们的日子就越难过。许多基因人在繁华的城市中迷失了自己，在习惯了各种不同人的地方，他们的与众不同几乎不会引起人们的注意。",
	"Those living on the frontier, though, have a much harder time. People there tend to be less accepting of differences. Sometimes a cold shoulder and a suspicious glare are the best genasi can hope for; in more backward places, they face ostracism and even violence from people who mistake them for fiends. Facing a hard life, these genasi seek isolation in the wilds, making their homes in mountains or forests, near lakes, or underground.": "不过，那些生活在边疆的人的日子要艰难得多。那里的人们往往不太接受差异。有时，一个冷漠的肩膀和一个怀疑的目光是genasi所能希望得到的最好结果；在更落后的地方，他们面临着排斥，甚至被人们误认为是魔鬼的暴力。面对艰难的生活，这些基因人在荒野中寻求隔离，在山区或森林、湖泊附近或地下安家。",
	"Most air and fire genasi in the Realms are descendants of the djinn and efreet who once ruled Calimshan. When those rulers were overthrown, their planetouched children were scattered. Over thousands of years, the bloodlines of those genasi have spread into other lands. Though far from common, air and fire genasi are more likely to be found in the western regions of Faerun, along the coast from Calimshan north up to the Sword Coast, and into the Western Heartlands to the east. Some remain in their ancient homeland.": "大多数王国的空气和火精灵都是曾经统治卡里姆山的精灵和伊夫里特的后裔。当这些统治者被推翻后，他们在星球上的孩子被分散了。几千年来，这些精灵的血统已经扩散到其他地区。虽然不常见，但空气和火系精灵更可能出现在法轮的西部地区，从卡里姆山向北到剑海岸的沿海地区，以及东部的西部中心地带。有些人还留在他们古老的家乡。",
	"In contrast, water and earth genasi have no common history. Individuals have difficulty tracing their own lineage, and bloodlines occasionally skip a generation or two. Many earth genasi originated in the North and spread out from there. Water genasi come from coastal areas, the largest concentration of them hailing from the regions surrounding the Sea of Fallen Stars.": "相比之下，水系和土系精灵没有共同的历史。个人很难追踪自己的血统，而且血统偶尔会跳过一两代。许多土族人起源于北方，并从那里传播出去。水系基因人来自沿海地区，其中最集中的是堕落星海周围的地区。",
	"The distant land of Zakhara is known only in legends to most inhabitants of Faerun. There, genies and spellcasters enter into bargains, and genasi can result from such pacts. Those genasi have been sources of great weal and woe in the history of that land.": "遥远的扎哈拉（Zakhara）对大多数法隆（Faerun）的居民来说只在传说中知道。在那里，精灵和施法者进行交易，而精灵可以从这种契约中产生。在那片土地的历史上，这些精灵一直是巨大利益和灾难的来源。",
	"Genasi use the naming conventions of the people among whom they were raised. They might later assume distinctive names to capture their heritage, such as Flame, Ember, Wave, or Onyx.": "基纳西人使用他们所生长的民族的命名惯例。他们后来可能会取一些独特的名字来捕捉他们的遗产，如火焰、微光、波浪或玛瑙。",
	"Tracing their ancestry to the genies of the Elemental Planes, each genasi can tap into the power of one of the elements. Air, earth, fire, and water—these are the four pillars of the Material Plane and the four types of genasi. Some genasi are direct descendants of a genie, while others were born to non-genasi parents who lived near a place suffused by a genie's magic.": "追溯到他们的祖先是元素界的精灵，每个精灵都可以利用其中一种元素的力量。气、土、火、水，这是物质世界的四大支柱，也是四种类型的精灵。有些精灵是精灵的直系后裔，而其他精灵则是由居住在被精灵的魔法笼罩的地方附近的非精灵父母所生。",
	"A typical genasi has a life span of 120 years.": "一个典型的genasi的寿命为120年。",
	"As an air genasi, you are descended from the djinn. As changeable as the weather, your moods shift from calm to wild and violent with little warning, but these storms rarely last long.": "作为一个空气精灵，你是精灵的后裔。就像天气一样多变，你的情绪从平静转变为狂野和暴力，几乎没有任何警告，但这些风暴很少持续很久。",
	"Air genasi typically have light blue skin, hair, and eyes. A faint but constant breeze accompanies them, tousling the hair and stirring the clothing. Some air genasi speak with breathy voices, marked by a faint echo. A few display odd patterns in their flesh or grow crystals from their scalps.": "空气族人通常有浅蓝色的皮肤、头发和眼睛。一阵微弱但持续的微风伴随着他们，抚摸着头发，搅动着衣服。有些空气族人说话时带着呼吸声，带有微弱的回声。少数人在他们的肉体上显示出奇怪的图案，或者从他们的头皮上长出水晶。",
	"As an earth genasi, you are descended from the cruel and greedy dao, though you are not necessarily evil. You have inherited some measure of control over earth, reveling in superior strength and solid power. You tend to avoid rash decisions, pausing long enough to consider your options before taking action.": "作为一个大地精灵，你是残酷和贪婪的道的后代，尽管你不一定是邪恶的。你继承了对大地的某种程度的控制，陶醉于卓越的力量和坚实的权力。你倾向于避免草率的决定，在采取行动之前会停顿足够长的时间考虑你的选择。",
	"Elemental earth manifests differently from one individual to the next. Some earth genasi always have bits of dust falling from their bodies and mud clinging to their clothes, never getting clean no matter how often they bathe. Others are as shiny and polished as gemstones, with skin tones of deep brown or black, eyes sparkling like agates. Earth genasi can also have smooth metallic flesh, dull iron skin spotted with rust, a pebbled and rough hide, or even a coating of tiny embedded crystals. The most arresting have fissures in their flesh, from which faint light shines.": "土元素的表现因人而异。有些土族人身上总是落着一些灰尘，衣服上粘着泥巴，无论他们怎么洗澡都不会干净。其他人则像宝石一样闪闪发光，皮肤呈深棕色或黑色，眼睛像玛瑙一样闪闪发光。大地精灵也可以有光滑的金属肉体，暗淡的铁皮上有铁锈斑点，有鹅卵石般的粗糙皮肤，甚至有一层微小的嵌入式晶体。最吸引人的是他们的肉体有裂缝，从裂缝中闪烁着微弱的光芒。",
	"As a fire genasi, you have inherited the volatile mood and keen mind of the efreet. You tend toward impatience and making snap judgments. Rather than hide your distinctive appearance, you exult in it.": "作为一个火属相，你继承了伊夫里特人的不稳定情绪和敏锐的头脑。你倾向于不耐烦和做出快速判断。你并不掩饰自己独特的外表，而是对它感到高兴。",
	"Nearly all fire genasi are feverishly hot as if burning inside, an impression reinforced by flaming red, coal-black, or ash-gray skin tones. The more human-looking have fiery red hair that writhes under extreme emotion, while more exotic specimens sport actual flames dancing on their heads. Fire genasi voices might sound like crackling flames, and their eyes flare when angered. Some are accompanied by the faint scent of brimstone.": "几乎所有的火族人都热得发烫，仿佛内心在燃烧，火焰般的红色、煤黑色或灰灰色的肤色强化了这种印象。长得比较像人的人有一头火红的头发，在极端的情绪下会蠕动，而更奇特的标本则是在头上跳着真正的火焰。火族人的声音可能听起来像噼里啪啦的火焰，他们的眼睛在被激怒的时候会闪闪发光。有些人还伴有淡淡的硫磺味。",
	"The lapping of waves, the spray of sea foam on the wind, the ocean depths, all of these things call to your heart. You wander freely and take pride in your independence, though others might consider you selfish.": "海浪的拍打，风中的海沫，海洋的深处，所有这些东西都在召唤你的心。你自由徜徉，为自己的独立感到自豪，尽管别人可能认为你很自私。",
	"Most water genasi look as if they just finished bathing, with beads of moisture collecting on their skin and hair. They smell of fresh rain and clean water. Blue or green skin is common, and most have somewhat overlarge eyes, blue-black in color. A water genasi's hair might float freely, swaying and waving as if underwater. Some have voices with undertones reminiscent of whale song or trickling streams.": "大多数水族人看起来就像刚洗完澡一样，皮肤和头发上都有湿润的珠子。他们闻起来有新鲜雨水和干净水的味道。蓝色或绿色皮肤很常见，大多数人的眼睛有点大，呈蓝黑色。水族人的头发可能会自由漂浮，像在水下一样摇摆和挥舞。有些人的声音有暗调，让人想起鲸鱼的歌声或涓涓溪流。",
	"Giff are tall, broad-shouldered folk with hippo-like features. Some have smooth skin, while others have short bristles on their faces and the tops of their heads. As beings of impressive size and unforgettable appearance, giff are noticed wherever they go.": "吉夫是高大、宽肩的民族，具有类似河马的特征。有些人的皮肤很光滑，而另一些人的脸上和头顶上有短毛。作为具有令人印象深刻的体型和令人难忘的外表的生物，吉夫无论走到哪里都会受到关注。",
	"Storytelling is a rich tradition among giff, and it's not uncommon to see a giff recounting their past exploits to an enraptured crowd. Having a friendly giff nearby when a tavern brawl erupts can also be useful, for a giff can usually more than hold their own when pleasant revelry devolves into fisticuffs.": "讲故事是吉夫的一个丰富的传统，看到一个吉夫对着陶醉的人群讲述他们过去的事迹是很常见的。当酒馆的争吵爆发时，有一个友好的吉夫在附近也是很有用的，因为当愉快的狂欢演变成拳脚相加时，吉夫通常能坚持自己的观点。",
	"The giff are split into two camps concerning how their name is pronounced. Half of them say it with a hard g, half with a soft g. Disagreements over the correct pronunciation often blossom into hard feelings, loud arguments, and headbutting contests, but rarely escalate beyond that.": "关于他们的名字如何发音，吉夫人分为两个阵营。对正确发音的分歧往往会演变成激烈的争吵和用头撞墙的比赛，但很少会升级到更高的程度。",
	"The story of the gith is rooted in a cruel twist of cosmic fate. Inspired by the great leader for whom the race is named, the gith rose up to overthrow the mind flayers that held them in servitude. But after they won their freedom, two factions among the gith disagreed on what kind of civilization they would forge. That disagreement quickly flared into open hostility, and the two groups distanced themselves from one another to pursue their separate agendas. They remain bitter enemies today, each side willing to fight to the death whenever they cross paths.": "吉斯人的故事植根于宇宙命运的残酷扭曲。在该种族被命名的伟大领袖的鼓舞下，吉斯人奋起反抗，推翻了使他们处于奴役状态的思想传播者。但在他们赢得自由后，吉斯人中的两个派别对他们将建立什么样的文明产生了分歧。这种分歧很快就演变成了公开的敌意，这两个群体彼此疏远，追求各自的议程。他们今天仍然是死敌，每一方只要有交集，就愿意战斗到死。",
	"The githyanki were motivated by revenge and convinced that they deserved to take whatever they wanted from the worlds they traveled. Ranging out from the titanic city of Tu'narath on the Astral Plane, they send raiders out to plunder the Material Plane and other worlds, bringing treasures and slaves back to their ageless realm. At the same time, they hunt down and kill mind flayers whenever possible, as recompense for what the illithids did to them.": "githyanki的动机是复仇，并确信他们值得从他们所游历的世界上拿走任何他们想要的东西。他们从星界的泰坦之城Tu'narath出发，派出突袭者去掠夺物质界和其他世界，把财宝和奴隶带回他们不老的领域。同时，他们尽可能地追捕并杀死心灵传播者，作为对伊利瑟斯人对他们所做的补偿。",
	"The githzerai believed that the path to an enlightened civilization lay in seclusion, not conflict. Their dedication to the principles of order is so strong that they can manipulate the stuff of chaos and use it to their benefit; thus, they have carved out a stronghold for themselves on the plane of Limbo that is virtually impervious. Though the githzerai are pacifists by nature, they share the githyanki's racial hatred for mind flayers, and from time to time they send out squads to destroy illithid outposts.": "吉斯泽拉人相信，通往开明文明的道路在于隐居，而不是冲突。他们对秩序原则的奉献是如此强烈，以至于他们可以操纵混乱的东西并将其用于自己的利益；因此，他们在林波平面上为自己开辟了一个几乎不受影响的据点。虽然吉斯泽拉人本质上是和平主义者，但他们与吉蒂扬基人一样，对思想传播者有着种族仇恨，他们不时地派出小队去摧毁伊利特人的前哨。",
	"If the two races were ever to team up against the illithids, a combined force of gith could conceivably tip the balance in their favor. But as long as the githyanki and githzerai stay at each other's throats, their goal of ultimate victory over their original common enemy will likely remain unachieved.": "如果这两个种族曾经联手对抗伊利斯人，可以想象，吉斯人的联合力量可以使天平转向对他们有利。但是，只要吉特汉克人和吉特泽拉人一直处于彼此的咽喉，他们最终战胜最初的共同敌人的目标就可能无法实现。",
	"The brutal githyanki are trained from birth as warriors.": "残暴的吉蒂安基人从出生就被训练成战士。",
	"In their fortresses within Limbo, the githzerai hone their minds to a razor's edge.": "在Limbo的堡垒中，吉斯泽拉人将他们的思想磨练得如刀锋般锋利。",
	"Once members of a people who escaped servitude to mind flayers, githyanki split from their cousins, githzerai, and fled to the Astral Plane. In that timeless, silvery realm, githyanki honed their psionic powers and built a great city called Tu'narath. They have since spread throughout the multiverse, starting in outposts outside the Astral Plane, called creches, where time passes and their children can reach adulthood.": "Githyanki曾经是一个摆脱了对心灵传播者的奴役的民族成员，他们从他们的表亲Githzerai那里分裂出来，逃到了星界。在那个永恒的、银色的领域中，吉蒂亚克人磨练了他们的幻觉能力，并建立了一座名为图纳拉斯的伟大城市。此后，他们遍布整个多元宇宙，从星界外的前哨站开始，被称为克里奇，在那里时间流逝，他们的孩子可以达到成年。",
	"A lanky people with skin tones of yellows, greens, and browns, githyanki complement their physical prowess with psionic might, instilled in them by mind flayers and cultivated over eons in the Astral Plane. Now all githyanki can use their psychic bond with that plane to access splinters of knowledge left behind by beings who travel, live, and die among the silver astral clouds.": "Githyanki是一个瘦长的民族，肤色为黄色、绿色和棕色，他们的身体素质与幻觉能力相辅相成，这些幻觉能力是由心灵传播者灌输给他们的，并在星界培养了好几个世纪。现在，所有的Githyanki都可以利用他们与星界的精神联系来获取那些在银色星云中旅行、生活和死亡的生命所留下的知识碎片。",
	"Githyanki who reside in the Astral Plane can live indefinitely.": "居住在星界的Githyanki可以无限期地活着。",
	"Githzerai migrated to the Everchanging Chaos of Limbo after the ancient schism that split their ancestors from their cousins, githyanki. Limbo is a roiling maelstrom of matter and energy, collapsing and reforming without purpose or direction, until a creature exerts deliberate will to stabilize it. Through their potent psionic power, githzerai carved a home for themselves amid the chaos. As the ages passed, githzerai explorers ranged out to other planes and worlds of the multiverse.": "在古老的分裂将他们的祖先与他们的表亲--吉提安基--分割开来之后，吉提安基迁移到了林博的不断变化的混沌中。林波是一个物质和能量的漩涡，在没有目的和方向的情况下崩溃和重组，直到有一个生物故意施加意志来稳定它。通过他们强大的幻觉能力，吉斯泽拉在混乱中为自己开辟了一个家园。随着岁月的流逝，githzerai的探险家们延伸到了多元宇宙的其他星球和世界。",
	"Githzerai are generally slender, with speckled skin in shades of yellow, green, or brown. Eons of cultivating their mental powers within the endless chaos of Limbo have imbued githzerai with the ability to shape psionic energy to protect themselves and probe minds.": "吉斯泽拉一般都很苗条，皮肤上有黄色、绿色或棕色的斑点。在Limbo的无尽混沌中培养他们的精神力量的漫长岁月，使Githzerai具备了塑造幻觉能量的能力，以保护他们自己和探测他们的思想。",
	"A constant hum of busy activity pervades the warrens and neighborhoods where gnomes form their close-knit communities. Louder sounds punctuate the hum: a crunch of grinding gears here, a minor explosion there, a yelp of surprise or triumph, and especially bursts of laughter. Gnomes take delight in life, enjoying every moment of invention, exploration, investigation, creation, and play.": "在地精们组成的紧密社区里，战争和邻里之间一直弥漫着繁忙的嗡嗡声。嗡嗡声中还夹杂着更大的声音：这里有磨齿轮的嘎吱声，那里有轻微的爆炸声，惊讶或胜利的吼叫声，尤其是一阵阵的笑声。侏儒们对生活充满乐趣，享受发明、探索、调查、创造和游戏的每一刻。",
	"A gnome's energy and enthusiasm for living shines through every inch his or her tiny body. Gnomes average slightly over 3 feet tall and weigh 40 to 45 pounds. Their tan or brown faces are usually adorned with broad smiles (beneath their prodigious noses), and their bright eyes shine with excitement. Their fair hair has a tendency to stick out in every direction, as if expressing the gnome's insatiable interest in everything around.": "地精的能量和对生活的热情在他或她小小的身体里闪闪发光。地精的平均身高略高于3英尺，体重为40至45磅。他们棕褐色或褐色的脸上通常装饰着宽阔的笑容（在他们巨大的鼻子下面），他们明亮的眼睛闪烁着兴奋的光芒。他们白皙的头发有向各个方向伸出的趋势，仿佛在表达地精对周围一切事物永不满足的兴趣。",
	"A gnome's personality is writ large in his or her appearance. A male gnome's beard, in contrast to his wild hair, is kept carefully trimmed but often styled into curious forks or neat points. A gnome's clothing, though usually made in modest earth tones, is elaborately decorated with embroidery, embossing, or gleaming jewels.": "一个地精的个性在他或她的外表中体现得淋漓尽致。男性地精的胡须，与他的狂野的头发形成对比，被仔细地修剪，但往往被修剪成奇怪的叉子或整齐的点。地精的衣服，虽然通常是用温和的大地色系制作的，但却用刺绣、压花或闪亮的珠宝精心装饰。",
	"As far as gnomes are concerned, being alive is a wonderful thing, and they squeeze every ounce of enjoyment out of their three to five centuries of life. Humans might wonder about getting bored over the course of such a long life, and elves take plenty of time to savor the beauties of the world in their long years, but gnomes seem to worry that even with all that time, they can't get in enough of the things they want to do and see.": "在地精看来，活着是一件美妙的事情，他们从三到五个世纪的生命中榨取每一盎司的乐趣。人类可能会怀疑在这么长的生命过程中会感到无聊，而精灵在他们漫长的岁月中会花很多时间来品味世界的美丽，但地精似乎担心即使有这么多时间，他们也无法得到足够的东西来做和看。",
	"Gnomes speak as if they can't get the thoughts out of their heads fast enough. Even as they offer ideas and opinions on a range of subjects, they manage to listen carefully to others, adding the appropriate exclamations of surprise and appreciation along the way.": "侏儒们说话的时候，好像他们无法快速地把想法从他们的脑子里拿出来。即使在他们对一系列主题提出想法和意见时，他们也会设法仔细倾听别人的意见，并在途中加入适当的惊讶和赞赏的感叹。",
	"Though gnomes love jokes of all kinds, particularly puns and pranks, they're just as dedicated to the more serious tasks they undertake. Many gnomes are skilled engineers, alchemists, tinkerers, and inventors. They're willing to make mistakes and laugh at themselves in the process of perfecting what they do, taking bold (sometimes foolhardy) risks and dreaming large.": "虽然地精喜欢各种笑话，特别是双关语和恶作剧，但他们对自己承担的更严肃的任务也同样专注。许多地精都是熟练的工程师、炼金术士、修补者和发明家。他们愿意在完善自己工作的过程中犯错并自嘲，大胆地（有时是愚蠢的）冒险，并有很大的梦想。",
	"Gnomes makes their homes in hilly, wooded lands. They live underground but get more fresh air than dwarves do, enjoying the natural, living world on the surface where ever they can. Their homes are well hidden by both clever construction and simple illusions. Welcome visitors are quickly ushered into the bright, warm burrows. Those who are not welcome are unlikely to find the burrows in the first place.": "侏儒把自己的家安在丘陵和森林地带。他们生活在地下，但比矮人获得更多的新鲜空气，只要有机会，他们就会享受地表上的自然、生活世界。他们的家被巧妙的建筑和简单的幻觉所掩盖。欢迎的访客很快就会被迎进明亮、温暖的洞穴中。那些不受欢迎的人首先就不可能找到这些洞穴。",
	"Gnomes who settle in human lands are commonly gemcutters, engineers, sages, or tinkerers. Some human families retained gnome tutors, ensuring that their pupils enjoy a mix of serious learning and delighted enjoyment. A gnome might tutor several generations of a single human family over the course of his or her long life.": "在人类土地上定居的地精通常是宝石切割师、工程师、圣人或工匠。一些人类家庭保留了地精导师，以确保他们的学生享受严肃的学习和快乐的享受。一个地精可能在他或她漫长的一生中为一个人类家庭的几代人提供辅导。",
	"Gnomes love names, and most have half a dozen or so. A gnome's mother, father, clan elder, aunts, and uncles each give the gnome a name, and various nicknames from just about everyone else might or might not stick over time. Gnome names are typically variants on the names of ancestors or distant relatives, though some are truly new inventions. When dealing with humans and others who are \"Stuffy\" about names, a gnome learns to use no more than three names; A personal name, a clan name, and a nickname, choosing the one in each category that's the most fun to say.": "地精喜欢名字，大多数都有半打左右的名字。地精的母亲、父亲、氏族长老、姑姑和叔叔都会给地精起一个名字，而其他人的各种绰号可能会或可能不会随着时间的推移而保留下来。地精的名字通常是祖先或远房亲戚的名字的变体，尽管有些是真正的新发明。当与人类和其他对名字很 \"苛刻 \"的人打交道时，地精学会了使用不超过三个名字；一个人名、一个族名和一个绰号，在每个类别中选择一个最有趣的名字。",

	"Curious and impulsive, gnomes might take up adventuring as a way to see the world or for the love of exploring. As lovers of gems and other fine items, some gnomes take to adventuring as s quick, if dangerous, path to wealth.

	"A third sub race of gnomes, the deep gnomes (or svirfneblin) live in small communities scattered in the Underdark. Unlike the duergar and the drow, svirfneblin are as good as their surface cousins. However, their humor and enthusiasm are dampened by their oppressive environment, and their inventive expertise is directed mostly toward stonework.": "作为地精的第三个分支种族，深层地精（或称svirfneblin）生活在散布于地下世界的小型社区。与duergar和drow不同，svirfneblin和他们的表面表亲一样优秀。然而，他们的幽默感和热情被他们压抑的环境所抑制，他们的创造性专长主要是针对石匠。",
	"Forest gnomes and rock gnomes are the gnomes most commonly encountered in the lands of the surface world. There is another subrace of gnomes rarely seen by any surface-dweller: deep gnomes, also known as svirfneblin.

	"Svirfneblin seem more like creatures of stone than flesh. Their leathery skin is usually a gray, brown, or dun hue that acts as a natural camouflage with the rock around them. Their bodies are gnarled with hard muscle or fat, and they are heavier than their small stature suggests; svirfneblin often weigh 100 pounds or more but rarely stand much more than 3 feet tall.": "斯维尔芬布林看起来更像是石头的生物，而不是肉体。他们皮革般的皮肤通常是灰色、棕色或暗色，与周围的岩石形成天然的伪装。他们的身体上长满了坚硬的肌肉或脂肪，而且他们比他们的小身材所显示的要重；斯维尔芬林通常重达100磅或更多，但很少有超过3英尺高的地方。",

Females have full heads of hair, and they usually tie their hair back in braids or cut it short to keep it from getting in their way as they work.": "男性svirfneblin从幼年开始就是秃头，尽管成年人可以长出硬胡须或胡子。女性有满头的头发，她们通常将头发扎成辫子或剪成短发，以免在工作时妨碍她们。",

	"Svirfneblin are known as deep gnomes because they choose to live far below the earth's surface. Most svirfneblin never see the light of day. Their homes are well-hidden strongholds concealed by mazelike passages and clever illusions. Vast networks of mine tunnels ring most svirfneblin settlements, guarded by deadly traps and concealed sentries. Once a traveler passes through the outer defenses, the tunnels open up into marvelous cavern-towns carved from the surrounding rock with exquisite care. The svirfneblin are austere in their comforts compared to their surface cousins, but they take great pride in their stonework.": "Svirfneblin被称为深层地精，因为他们选择生活在地球表面以下很远的地方。大多数斯维尔夫林人从未见过阳光。他们的家是被迷宫般的通道和巧妙的幻觉所掩盖的隐蔽的据点。庞大的矿道网络环绕着大多数斯维尔芬林定居点，由致命的陷阱和隐蔽的哨兵把守。一旦旅行者通过外部防御，隧道就会打开，进入奇妙的洞穴城镇，这些洞穴都是以精致的方式从周围的岩石中雕刻出来的。与地面上的表亲相比，斯维尔芬林人的舒适度很低，但他们对自己的石雕作品感到非常自豪。",

Those rare travelers who do succeed in befriending deep gnomes find that they are loyal and courageous allies against any foe.": "深海地精竭力保持隐蔽。即使地面上的旅行者成功地找到了一个斯维尔芬布林社区，赢得他们的信任也会更加困难。那些成功结交深层地精的罕见旅行者发现，他们是忠实而勇敢的盟友，可以对抗任何敌人。",
	"Surface-dwelling gnomes often take up the adventurer's life out of sheer curiosity about the world around them, eager to see new things and meet new people.": "居住在地表的地精常常出于对周围世界的好奇而选择冒险家的生活，渴望看到新的事物，认识新的人。",
	"By comparison, most svirfneblin possess very little wanderlust and rarely travel far from home. They see the surface world as a bewildering place without boundaries and filled with unknown dangers.": "相比之下，大多数斯维尔纳布林人很少有漫游的欲望，也很少离家远行。在他们看来，表面世界是一个没有边界的令人困惑的地方，充满了未知的危险。",
	"Nevertheless, a few svirfneblin understand that it is necessary to know something about what is happening on the surface near their hidden refuges. As a result, some svirfneblin become scouts, spies, or messengers who venture abroad, doing their best to avoid attention.": "然而，少数svirfneblin明白，有必要了解他们隐藏的避难所附近的地面上发生的事情。因此，一些svirfneblin成为侦察员、间谍或信使，在国外冒险，尽最大努力避免引起注意。",
	"These travelers are notoriously close-mouthed about where they come from and what they are up to, but a few eventually learn to trust good-hearted people of the surface world.": "这些旅行者对他们的来历和目的闭口不谈，但有几个人最终学会了信任地面世界的好心人。",
	"A few svirfneblin become merchants who deal with other races both above and below ground. Drow, duergar, and other peoples know that svirfneblin are usually neutral in outlook and typically honest in their dealings. Serving as middlemen between races too hostile to deal with each other directly can be lucrative, and it serves an important defensive function; svirfneblin middlemen tend to know more about rumors and threats between rival merchants than anybody else.": "少数斯维尔芬林人成为商人，在地面和地下与其他种族打交道。鸦人、duergar和其他民族都知道，svirfneblin通常在观念上是中立的，在交易中通常是诚实的。在过于敌对的种族之间充当中间人，直接与对方打交道，可以获得丰厚的利润，而且它具有重要的防御功能；斯维尔芬林的中间人往往比其他人更了解敌对商人之间的谣言和威胁。",
	"Svirfneblin prefer less flamboyant names than their rock gnome or forest gnome cousins. Clan names reflect skills or occupations that a particular family is associated with, and sometimes change if a noteworthy individual strikes out in a new direction.": "与他们的岩石地精或森林地精表亲相比，斯维尔纳布林喜欢不那么张扬的名字。氏族的名字反映了一个特定家族的技能或职业，如果一个值得注意的人在一个新的方向上出击，有时会改变。",
	"Belwar, Brickers, Durthmeck, Firble, Krieger, Kronthud, Schneltheck, Schnicktick, Thulwar, Walschud": "Belwar, Brickers, Durthmeck, Firble, Warrior, Kronthud, Schneltheck, Schnicktick, Thulwar, Walschud",

	"In the Forgotten Realms, deep gnomes live within a perilous, subterranean world known as the Underdark. This maze of caverns and tunnels is home to some of the most feared creatures in Faerûn. Because of this, the svirfneblin that dwell here are much more distrusting and wary than their kin on other worlds. Rarely do they allow strangers within their midst, and those that they must deal with are kept at arms length. If one is lucky enough to be trusted by the deep gnomes, they are a friend for life. For the svirfneblin of the Underdark, genuine trust is a commodity far more valuable than gold.": "在被遗忘的领域中，深层地精生活在一个危险的地下世界，被称为 \"地下城\"。这个由洞穴和隧道组成的迷宫是Faerûn中一些最可怕的生物的家园。正因为如此，居住在这里的svirfneblin比他们在其他世界的亲属更加不信任和警惕。他们很少允许陌生人进入他们的圈子，而那些必须与他们打交道的人则保持距离。如果一个人有幸被深海地精信任，他们将是一个终身的朋友。对于地下城的svirfneblin来说，真正的信任是一种远比黄金更有价值的商品。",
	"As a forest gnome, you have a natural knack for illusion and inherent quickness and stealth. In the worlds of D&D, forest gnomes are rare and secretive. They gather in hidden communities in sylvan forests, using illusions and trickery to conceal themselves from threats or to mask their escape should they be detected. Forest gnomes tend to be friendly with other good-spirited woodland folk, and they regard elves and good fey as their most important allies. These gnomes also befriend small forest animals and rely on them for information about threats that might prowl their lands.": "作为一个森林地精，你对幻觉有天生的诀窍，并且有与生俱来的快速和隐蔽性。在D&D的世界里，森林地精是罕见的、隐秘的。他们聚集在树林中的隐蔽社区，利用幻觉和诡计来隐藏自己，以避免受到威胁，或者在被发现时掩饰自己的逃跑。森林地精倾向于与其他心地善良的林地居民友好相处，他们把精灵和善良的费伊视为最重要的盟友。这些地精还与森林中的小动物交好，并依靠它们获得可能在他们土地上徘徊的威胁的信息。",
	"As a rock gnome, you have a natural inventiveness and hardiness beyond that of other gnomes. Most gnomes in the worlds of D&D are rock gnomes, including the tinker gnomes of the Dragonlance setting.": "作为一个岩石地精，你拥有超越其他地精的自然发明力和坚韧。D&D世界中的大多数地精都是岩石地精，包括《龙之谷》设定中的工匠地精。",
	"Whether sniveling in fear, cackling with mad laughter, or snarling in a fury, goblins are wretched and inconsequential—at least in the eyes of most of Ravnica's other folk. In their own minds, though, they are content to lurk in the shadows only until they fully come into their own and receive the recognition they believe they deserve. They are entitled to some credit for their tenacity, agility, crafty ingenuity, and dumb luck, all of which has enabled them to survive in a world overrun with creatures larger and more powerful than they are.": "无论是在恐惧中啜泣，还是在疯狂的笑声中咯咯作响，抑或是在愤怒中咆哮，地精都是可悲的、无足轻重的--至少在大多数拉夫尼卡的其他居民眼中是如此。不过，在他们自己的心目中，他们只满足于潜伏在阴影中，直到他们完全进入自己的世界，得到他们认为应该得到的认可。他们有权为自己的坚韧、敏捷、狡猾的聪明才智和愚蠢的运气获得一些荣誉，所有这些都使他们能够在一个比他们更大、更强大的生物泛滥的世界中生存。",
	"Standing around 3 feet tall and covered in warty green or red skin, goblins have huge noses and ears. Their wiry bodies are surprisingly strong, and their mouths are full of sharp, crooked teeth.": "妖精身高约3英尺，覆盖着疣状的绿色或红色皮肤，有巨大的鼻子和耳朵。他们毛茸茸的身体出奇地强壮，他们的嘴里长满了锋利的、弯曲的牙齿。",
	"Most goblins are bald, either by heredity or by choice, but a few boast shocks of red or black hair. Their arms and legs are elongated in proportion to their small bodies, and their fingers and toes are also long and slender. Many goblins prefer to go unshod to leave their toes exposed for climbing.": "大多数地精都是秃头，或是因为遗传或是因为选择，但也有少数地精拥有红色或黑色的头发。他们的胳膊和腿与他们的小身体成比例地拉长，他们的手指和脚趾也很细长。许多妖精喜欢不穿鞋，以使他们的脚趾暴露在外面，便于攀爬。",
	"Creatures of raw impulse, goblins are found among guilds that value that quality, particularly the Izzet (where they typically serve as attendants for researchers), the Gruul (in camps that form hapless buffers between the clans and civilized regions), the Rakdos (putting their love of explosions to good use), and occasionally the Boros (if they discover a well of discipline and courage within themselves, or find themselves unable to resist the shininess of Boros weapons and armor). Many goblins are guildless and make their way as members of street gangs.": "妖精是原始冲动的生物，在重视这种品质的行会中被发现，特别是伊泽特（他们通常在那里为研究人员提供服务）、格鲁尔（在部落和文明地区之间形成无助的缓冲区的营地）、拉克多（将他们对爆炸的热爱发挥到极致），偶尔也有波洛（如果他们发现自己内心有良好的纪律和勇气，或者发现自己无法抵制波洛武器和盔甲的闪耀）。许多地精是没有公会的，他们作为街头帮派的成员来谋生。",
	"Sometimes driven by wild mood swings, goblins have an inclination toward destruction, which can take a playful form but is often anything but. Some goblins clobber things, others like to light them on fire, and many love to blow things up.": "有时在狂野的情绪波动的驱使下，妖精有一种破坏的倾向，它可以采取玩耍的形式，但往往不是这样。有些妖精会用手抓东西，有些则喜欢点火，还有很多妖精喜欢把东西炸掉。",
	"Goblins have an outrageous sense of humor, usually expressed through mischievous pranks. The malicious among them find pleasure in the misfortune of others and tend to cackle maniacally whenever they're amused. They can act with apparent randomness, sometimes just to confuse and befuddle others.": "妖精有一种离谱的幽默感，通常通过调皮的恶作剧来表达。他们中的恶意者在别人的不幸中找到乐趣，每当他们被逗乐时，往往会疯狂地咯咯大笑。他们的行为显然是随机的，有时只是为了迷惑和迷惑他人。",
	"The Goblin language is fond of certain sounds, and goblin names tend to repeat those sounds to form what can sound like nonsense words. A goblin's name gives no indication of gender.": "妖精语言喜欢某些声音，而妖精的名字往往重复这些声音，形成听起来像无意义的词语。妖精的名字不会显示出性别。",
	"Azzinax, Babolax, Blixanix, Crixizix, Dazzaz, Estrix, Finizix, Juzba, Kaluzax, Lyzaxa, Mizzix, Myznar, Nixispix, Paxizaz, Ravixiz, Stixil, Sunnix, Tozinox, Uxivozi, Vazozav, Wexiny, Zizzix": "Azzinax, Babolax, Blixanix, Crixizix, Dazzaz, Estrix, Finizix, Juzba, Kaluzax, Lyzaxa, Mizzix, Myznar, Nixispix, Paxizaz, Ravixiz, Stixil, Sunnix, Tozinox, Uxivozi, Vazozav, Wexiny, Zizzix",
	"A subterranean folk, goblins can be found in every corner of the multiverse, often beside their bugbear and hobgoblin kin. Long before the god Maglubiyet conquered them, early goblins served in the court of the Queen of Air and Darkness, one of the Feywild's archfey. Goblins thrived in her dangerous domain thanks to a special boon from her—a supernatural knack for finding the weak spots in foes larger than themselves and for getting out of trouble. Goblins brought this fey boon with them to worlds across the Material Plane, even if they don't remember the fey realm they inhabited before Maglubiyet's rise. Now many goblins pursue their own destinies, escaping the plots of both archfey and gods.": "作为一个地下民族，地精可以在多元宇宙的每一个角落被发现，通常与他们的虫熊和妖精亲属在一起。早在玛格鲁比耶神征服他们之前，早期的地精就在空气和黑暗女王的宫廷中服务，她是精灵世界的大帝之一。妖精在她危险的领域中茁壮成长，这要归功于她的一个特殊恩赐--找到比自己大的敌人的弱点并摆脱困境的超自然诀窍。妖精们把这种精灵的恩惠带到了物质世界的各个角落，即使他们不记得在马格卢比耶特崛起之前他们所居住的精灵世界。现在，许多地精追求自己的命运，逃避大帝和诸神的阴谋。",
	"Ahh the Dankwood goblins! I have adventured far and wide in my time and never have I met such unique and interesting goblins as these. Perhaps it is the magical nature of the Dankwood itself as this forest was once rumored to have been the ancient sanctum of a powerful Netherese wizard, but who is to say? This world is a wondrous one and everywhere you go, something new is there to dazzle and amaze!": "啊，丹克伍德的妖精们！我在冒险的过程中走得很远，从来没有遇到过像他们这样独特而有趣的妖精。在我的时间里，我曾远赴各地冒险，但从未遇到过像这样独特而有趣的妖精。也许这是因为丹克伍德本身的神奇性质，因为这片森林曾被传为一个强大的尼瑟斯巫师的古老圣地，但谁又能说得清呢？这个世界是一个奇妙的世界，无论你走到哪里，都会有新的东西让你眼花缭乱，大吃一惊!",
	"Dankwood goblins are much like any other run-of-the-mill goblin but they are much more gentle and artistic than the savage and uncouth goblins of the world.": "丹克伍德的妖精和其他普通的妖精很像，但他们比世界上野蛮的、不讲究的妖精要温柔和艺术得多。",
	"They are inquisitive and have a magical bond with the small forest creatures with which they are often friends. They are fast and nimble and love to explore. Because of this they make great adventurers and guides.": "他们好奇心强，与森林中的小动物有着神奇的联系，他们经常与这些小动物成为朋友。他们速度快，动作灵活，喜欢探索。正因为如此，他们是伟大的冒险家和向导。",
	"Goblins are an inquisitive and adaptable race hampered by their small size, their natural cowardice, and a severe shortage of common sense. They eagerly explore areas that others hesitate to enter, and obsessively fiddle with magic that more sensible folk would take careful precautions with. They prize ancient artifacts not for their inherent value, but primarily as a mark of status—for a precious trophy proves that its owner survived a delve into a deep and dangerous ruin.": "地精是一个好奇心强、适应性强的种族，但由于他们身材矮小，天生胆小，而且严重缺乏常识。他们热衷于探索别人不愿进入的领域，并痴迷于摆弄那些更理智的人们会小心防范的魔法。他们对古代文物的珍视不是因为其固有的价值，而主要是作为一种地位的标志--一个珍贵的战利品证明它的主人在深入危险的废墟中幸存下来。",
	"Goblins are associated with red mana. Their shamans are fond of spells that create or control fire and lightning to smite their foes, and they are quick to follow their impulses and passions into action without much forethought. Life to a goblin is an adventure full of new things to explore and experience.": "妖精与红色的法力有关。他们的巫师喜欢使用创造或控制火和闪电的法术来粉碎他们的敌人，他们很快就会跟随自己的冲动和激情行动，而不需要太多的预想。对妖精来说，生活是一场充满新事物的冒险，需要探索和体验。",
	"A typical goblin stands between three-and-a-half and five feet tall, with a slender, elongated build. Goblins' arms are unusually long and spindly, making them adept at climbing cliffs and trees. Their skin has a stony texture, ranging in color from red-brown to moss green or gray. Their ears are large and swept back, their eyes are intensely red, and many sport heavy bone protrusions on their spines or elbows. Males have similar growths jutting from their chins, while females have heavier growths on their foreheads.": "典型的妖精身高在三英尺半到五英尺之间，身材纤细修长。妖精的手臂异常修长，使他们善于攀登悬崖和树木。他们的皮肤有一种石质纹理，颜色从红褐色到苔藓绿色或灰色不等。它们的耳朵很大，向后掠过，眼睛是强烈的红色，许多人的脊柱或肘部都有沉重的骨骼突起。雄性的下巴上有类似的突起，而雌性的额头上有更重的突起。",
	"This distinctive appearance is a direct result of the goblins' unusual diet. Before the Eldrazi's rise, goblins supplemented their normal diet with a kind of rock they pounded into bits and called \"grit.\" The presence of the Eldrazi in Zendikar has poisoned this rock, so the goblins have taken to eating powdered hedrons instead. Eating this magic-infused stone has given the goblins resistance to the maddening psychic emanations of the Eldrazi. As an added benefit, it toughens their skin, protecting them from the elements and from physical dangers.": "这种独特的外观是地精不寻常的饮食的直接结果。在埃尔德拉兹崛起之前，地精用一种被他们捣碎的岩石来补充他们的正常饮食，并称之为 \"砂砾\"。埃尔德拉兹在赞迪卡的存在使这种岩石中毒，所以地精们改吃粉末状的赫龙。食用这种注入了魔力的石头，使地精们对埃尔德拉兹的疯狂精神辐射有了抵抗力。作为一个额外的好处，它还能强化他们的皮肤，保护他们免受元素和身体危险的影响。",
	"Smaller and weaker than their cousins, and with larger hands and feet, goblins of the Grotag tribe attempt to live by their wits—though seldom with much success. When a Grotag goblin has the bright idea of trying to tame fleshpiercer mites, at least a few others will be willing to follow that goblin into a nest—usually to predictably horrible results. But though the Grotag seem to have a never-ending supply of bad ideas, and a horrible ratio of bad ideas to good, the Grotag likewise seem to have a never-ending supply of Grotag. As such, by trial and error (and more error), these goblins have stumbled across a great deal of knowledge useful for surviving the deep places of Zendikar, and for dealing with the creatures that live there. The Grotag imagine themselves to have a sort of empathy with beasts, and they lose hundreds of goblins each year to ill-advised attempts at monster taming. But, every now and again, one of these efforts is successful.": "Grotag部落的妖精比他们的表亲更小、更弱，而且手脚更大，他们试图靠自己的智慧生活，但很少成功。当一个格罗塔格妖精有了试图驯服肉食者螨虫的聪明想法时，至少有几个其他的妖精会愿意跟随这个妖精进入一个巢穴--通常会出现可预见的可怕结果。但是，尽管格罗塔格人似乎有永无止境的坏主意，以及坏主意与好主意的可怕比例，格罗塔格人同样也有永无止境的格罗塔格人。因此，通过试验和错误（以及更多的错误），这些地精偶然发现了大量的知识，这些知识对于在赞迪卡的深处生存以及与生活在那里的生物打交道很有帮助。格罗塔格人认为自己与野兽有某种共鸣，他们每年都会因为不明智的驯服怪物的尝试而失去数百名地精。但是，每隔一段时间，这些努力就会有一次成功。",
	"The Lavastep tribe is the most industrious of the goblin tribes, and possesses much hard-won knowledge of the geothermal activity in Akoum. More so than members of the other tribes, the Lavastep goblins build surprisingly effective equipment out of the crystal shards and veins of strange metals that occasionally boil up to the surface. The most warlike of their kind, Lavastep goblins frequently harass the kor, elves, and humans of Akoum.": "拉瓦斯特普部落是最勤劳的地精部落，拥有许多来之不易的关于阿库姆地热活动的知识。比起其他部落的成员，拉瓦斯特普的地精用水晶碎片和偶尔沸腾到地表的奇怪金属矿脉建造了令人惊讶的有效设备。作为最善战的种族，拉瓦斯特普地精经常骚扰阿库姆的科尔人、精灵和人类。",
	"Among the goblins, the Tuktuk are most likely to hire themselves out as ruin guides to other races. Of course, their usual plan is to help find something of value, steal it, trigger a trap intentionally, and then run.": "在地精中，Tuktuk人最有可能把自己出租给其他种族作为废墟向导。当然，他们通常的计划是帮助找到有价值的东西，偷走它，故意触发一个陷阱，然后逃跑。",
	"The first goliaths lived on the highest mountain peaks—far above the tree line, where the air is thin and frigid winds howl. Distantly related to giants and infused with the supernatural essence of their ancestors' mountainous home, goliaths stand between 7 and 8 feet tall and have a wide array of skin tones resembling different types of stone.": "最初的歌利亚人生活在最高的山峰上--远在树线之上，那里空气稀薄，寒风呼啸。哥利亚人与巨人有着遥远的联系，并注入了他们祖先山区家园的超自然精华，他们身高在7到8英尺之间，有各种各样的肤色，类似于不同类型的石头。",
	"At the highest mountain peaks-far above the slopes where trees grow and where the air is thin and the frigid winds howl-dwell the reclusive goliaths. Few folk can claim to have seen a goliath, and fewer still can claim friendship with them. Goliaths wander a bleak realm of rock, wind, and cold. Their bodies look as if they are carved from mountain stone and give them great physical power. Their spirits take after the wandering wind, making them nomads who wander from peak to peak. Their hearts are infused with the cold regard of their frigid realm, leaving each goliath with the responsibility to earn a place in the tribe or die trying.": "在最高的山峰--远在树木生长的山坡之上，空气稀薄，寒风呼啸--居住着隐居的巨人。很少有人能声称见过歌利亚，更少有人能声称与他们有友谊。哥利亚人在岩石、风和寒冷的荒凉领域里游荡。他们的身体看起来好像是由山石雕刻而成，并赋予他们强大的身体力量。他们的精神追随流浪的风，使他们成为从一个山峰游荡到另一个山峰的游牧者。他们的心被注入了寒冷领域的冷漠，让每一个巨人都有责任在部落中赢得一席之地，否则就会死去。",
	"Every day brings a new challenge to a goliath. Food, water, and shelter are rare in the uppermost mountain reaches. A single mistake can bring doom to an entire tribe, while an individual's heroic effort can ensure the entire group's survival.": "每一天都会给巨人带来新的挑战。在最上游的山区，食物、水和住所都很罕见。一个错误可以给整个部落带来灭顶之灾，而一个人的英勇努力可以确保整个群体的生存。",
	"Goliaths thus place a premium on self-sufficiency and individual skill. They have a compulsion to keep score, counting their deeds and tallying their accomplishments to compare to others. Goliaths love to win, but they see defeat as a prod to improve their skills.": "因此，歌利亚人重视自给自足和个人技能。他们有一种记账的强迫症，计算自己的行为和统计自己的成就，以便与他人比较。高利贷者喜欢赢，但他们把失败看作是对他们技能提高的一种鞭策。",
	"This dedication to competition has a dark side. Goliaths are ferocious competitors, but above all else they are driven to outdo their past efforts. If a goliath slays a dragon, he or she might seek out a larger, more powerful wyrm to battle. Few goliath adventurers reach old age, as most die attempting to surpass their past accomplishments.": "这种对竞争的奉献精神有其黑暗的一面。巨人是凶猛的竞争者，但最重要的是，他们被驱使着去超越他们过去的努力。如果一个巨人杀死了一条龙，他或她可能会寻找一个更大、更强大的巫妖来战斗。很少有巨人冒险家能活到老，因为大多数人都是为了超越他们过去的成就而死去。",
	"For goliaths, competition exists only when it is supported by a level playing field. Competition measures talent, dedication, and effort. Those factors determine survival in their home territory, not reliance on magic items, money, or other elements that can tip the balance one way or the other. Goliaths happily rely on such benefits, but they are careful to remember that such an advantage can always be lost. A goliath who relies too much on them can grow complacent, a recipe for disaster in the mountains.": "对于巨人来说，竞争只有在有公平竞争环境的支持下才存在。竞争衡量的是天赋、奉献和努力。这些因素决定了他们在本土的生存，而不是对魔法物品、金钱或其他可以使天平倾斜的元素的依赖。巨人乐于依赖这样的好处，但他们会小心翼翼地记住，这样的优势总是会失去。太过依赖它们的巨人可能会变得自满，这在山区是一个灾难的秘诀。",
	"This trait manifests most strongly when goliaths interact with other folk. The relationship between peasants and nobles puzzles goliaths. If a king lacks the intelligence or leadership to lead, then clearly the most talented person in the kingdom should take his place. Goliaths rarely keep such opinions to themselves, and mock folk who rely on society's structures or rules to maintain power.": "当歌利亚人与其他民间人士互动时，这种特征表现得最为强烈。农民和贵族之间的关系让歌利亚人感到困惑。如果一个国王缺乏领导的智慧或领导能力，那么显然应该由王国中最有才华的人取代他的位置。哥利亚人很少将这种观点保留下来，并嘲笑那些依靠社会结构或规则来维持权力的民间人士。",
	"Among goliaths, any adult who can't contribute to the tribe is expelled. A lone goliath has little chance of survival, especially an older or weaker one. Goliaths have little pity for adults who can't take care of themselves, though a sick or injured individual is treated, as a result of the goliath concept of fair play.": "在歌利亚人中，任何不能为部落做出贡献的成年人都会被驱逐。孤独的歌利亚人几乎没有生存的机会，尤其是年长或较弱的人。歌利亚人对不能照顾自己的成年人几乎没有怜悯之心，尽管生病或受伤的人得到治疗，这是歌利亚人公平竞争观念的结果。",
	"A permanently injured goliath is still expected to pull his or her weight in the tribe. Typically, such a goliath dies attempting to keep up, or the goliath slips away in the night to seek the cold will of fate.": "一个永久受伤的巨人仍被期望在部落中发挥他或她的力量。通常情况下，这样的巨人会因为试图跟上而死亡，或者巨人会在夜里溜走，以寻求命运的冷酷意志。",
	"In some ways, the goliath drive to outdo themselves feeds into the grim inevitability of their decline and death. A goliath would much rather die in battle, at the peak of strength and skill, than endure the slow decay of old age. Few folk have ever meet an elderly goliath, and even those goliaths who have left their people grapple with the urge to give up their lives as their physical skills decay.": "在某些方面，巨人超越自我的动力助长了他们衰落和死亡的严峻的必然性。一个巨人宁愿在战斗中死去，在力量和技能的巅峰时期死去，也不愿忍受老年的缓慢衰败。很少有人见过年老的歌利亚，即使是那些已经离开他们的人民的歌利亚，也会在他们的身体技能衰退的时候，努力克服放弃自己生命的冲动。",
	"Because of their risk-taking, goliath tribes suffer from a chronic lack of the experience offered by longterm leaders. They hope for innate wisdom in their leadership, for they can rarely count on a wisdom grown with age.": "由于他们的冒险精神，巨人部落长期缺乏长期领导人所提供的经验。他们希望领导层有天生的智慧，因为他们很少能指望随着年龄增长的智慧。",
	"Every goliath has three names: a birth name assigned by the newborn's mother and father, a nickname assigned by the tribal chief, and a family or clan name. A birth name is up to three syllables long. Clan names are five syllables or more and end in a vowel.": "每个歌利亚都有三个名字：新生儿的母亲和父亲指定的出生名，部落首领指定的绰号，以及家族或宗族的名字。出生时的名字最多三个音节。氏族名称是五个音节或更多，以元音结尾。",
	"Birth names are rarely linked to gender. Goliaths see females and males as equal in all things, and they find societies with roles divided by gender to be puzzling or worthy of mockery. To a goliath, the person who is best at a job should be the one tasked with doing it.": "出生的名字很少与性别挂钩。哥利亚人认为女性和男性在所有事情上都是平等的，他们认为按性别划分角色的社会是令人费解的，或值得嘲笑的。对一个巨人来说，最擅长一项工作的人应该是负责这项工作的人。",
	"A goliath's nickname is a description that can change on the whim of a chieftain or tribal elder. It refers to a notable deed, either a success or failure, committed by the goliath. Goliaths assign and use nicknames with their friends of other races, and change them to refer to an individual's notable deeds.": "歌利亚的绰号是一种描述，可以根据首领或部落长老的意愿而改变。它指的是歌利亚所做的一个显著的事迹，无论是成功还是失败。歌利亚人与他们的其他种族的朋友分配和使用绰号，并改变它们来指代个人的显著事迹。",
	"Goliaths present all three names when identifying themselves, in the order of birth name, nickname, and clan name. In casual conversation, they use their nickname.": "高丽人在表明自己的身份时，按照出生名、绰号和氏族名的顺序，提出所有三个名字。在闲谈中，他们使用自己的昵称。",

When stretched taut, these membranes enable a hadozee to glide.": "Hadozees是具有类人猿特征的人，很久以前就适应了在他们家乡世界的高大树木中生活。他们是天生的攀爬者，他们的脚和他们的手一样灵巧，甚至有对立的拇指的程度。他们的手臂和腿上松散地挂着皮肤膜。当被绷紧时，这些皮膜使哈多兹人能够滑行。",
	"The first hadozees were hunted by large natural predators. To survive in this hostile environment, they developed an instinctual sense of community. Today, that same instinct compels many hadozees to cultivate friendships, knowing there is safety in numbers.": "第一批哈多兹人被大型自然捕食者猎杀。为了在这种恶劣的环境中生存，他们发展出一种本能的群体意识。今天，这种本能迫使许多哈多兹人培养友谊，因为他们知道人多力量大。",
	"Walking in two worlds but truly belonging to neither, half-elves combine what some say are the best qualities of their elf and human parents: human curiosity, inventiveness, and ambition tempered by the refined senses, love of nature, and artistic tastes of the elves. Some half-elves live among humans, set apart by their emotional and physical differences, watching friends and loved ones age while time barely touches them. Others live with the elves, growing to adulthood while their peers continue to live as children, growing restless in the timeless elven realms. Many half-elves, unable to fit into either society, choose lives of solitary wandering or join with other misfits and outcasts in the adventuring life.": "走在两个世界中，但真正不属于任何一个世界，半精灵结合了一些人所说的他们的精灵和人类父母的最佳品质：人类的好奇心、创造力和野心被精灵的精致感官、对自然的热爱和艺术品味所调和。一些半精灵生活在人类中间，因为他们的情感和身体差异而被分开，看着朋友和亲人老去，而时间几乎没有触及他们。其他人则与精灵生活在一起，成长为成年人，而他们的同龄人则继续作为儿童生活，在永恒的精灵王国中不安地成长。许多半精灵无法融入这两个社会，选择了孤独的流浪生活，或与其他不合群的人和被抛弃的人一起过冒险生活。",
	"To humans, half-elves look like elves, and to elves, they look human. In height, they're on par with both parents, though they're neither as slender as elves nor as broad as humans. They range from under 5 feet to about 6 feet tall, and from 100 to 180 pounds, with men only slightly taller and heavier than women. Half-elf men do have facial hair, and sometimes grow beards to mask their elven ancestry. Half-elven coloration and features lie, somewhere between their human and elf parents, and thus show a variety even more pronounced than that found among either race. They tend to have the eyes of their elven parents.": "对人类来说，半精灵看起来像精灵，而对精灵来说，他们看起来像人类。在身高方面，他们与父母双方相当，尽管他们既不像精灵那样苗条，也不像人类那样宽大。他们的身高从5英尺以下到6英尺左右不等，体重从100磅到180磅不等，男性只比女性略高和重一些。半精灵男子确实有面部毛发，有时会蓄起胡须以掩盖他们的精灵血统。半精灵的肤色和特征介于人类和精灵父母之间，因此显示出比这两个种族中更明显的多样性。他们倾向于拥有精灵族父母的眼睛。",
	"Half-elves have no lands of their own, though they are welcome in human cities and somewhat less welcome in elven forests. In large cities in regions where elves and humans interact often, half-elves are sometimes numerous enough to form small communities of their own. They enjoy the company of other half-elves, the only people who truly understand what it is to live between these two worlds.": "半身人没有自己的土地，不过他们在人类城市中很受欢迎，在精灵森林中则不太受欢迎。在精灵和人类经常交往的地区的大城市里，半精灵有时多到足以形成自己的小社区。他们喜欢与其他半精灵为伴，只有这些人真正了解生活在这两个世界之间的情况。",
	"In most parts of the world, though, half-elves are uncommon enough that one might live for years without meeting another. Some prefer to avoid company altogether, wandering the wilds as foresters, hunters, or adventurers and visiting civilization only rarely. Like elves, they are driven by the wanderlust that comes of their longevity. Others, in contrast, throw themselves into the thick of society, putting their charisma and social skills to great use in diplomatic roles or as swindlers.": "不过，在世界大部分地区，半精灵并不常见，一个人可能活了好几年都没有遇到另一个。有些人喜欢完全避开同伴，作为林务员、猎人或冒险家在荒野中游荡，只在很少情况下访问文明。就像精灵一样，他们被长寿带来的漫游欲望所驱使。与此相反，其他人则投身于社会之中，将他们的魅力和社交技巧在外交角色或诈骗者中得到极大的发挥。",
	"Half-elves use either human or elven naming conventions. As if to emphasize that they don't really fit in to either society, half-elves raised among humans are often given elven names, and those raised among elves often take human names.": "半精灵使用人类或精灵的命名惯例。似乎是为了强调他们并不真正适合这两个社会，在人类中长大的半精灵常常被赋予精灵的名字，而在精灵中长大的半精灵常常使用人类的名字。",
	"Many half-elves learn at an early age to get along with everyone, defusing hostility and finding common ground. As a race, they have elves grace without elves aloofness and human energy without human boorishness. They often make excellent ambassadors and go-betweens (except between elves and humans, since each side suspects the half-elf of favoring the other).": "许多半精灵在很小的时候就学会了与所有人相处，化解敌意并找到共同点。作为一个种族，他们有精灵的优雅而没有精灵的冷漠，有人类的活力而没有人类的粗野。他们经常成为优秀的大使和中间人（除了在精灵和人类之间，因为双方都怀疑半精灵偏袒对方）。",
	"Whether united under the leadership of a mighty warlock or having fought to a standstill after years of conflict, orc and human tribes sometimes form alliances, joining forces into a larger horde to the terror of civilized lands nearby. When these alliances are sealed by marriages, half-orcs are born. Some half-orcs rise to become proud chiefs of orc tribes, their human blood giving them an edge over their full-blooded orc rivals. Some venture into the world to prove their worth among humans and other civilized races. Many of these become adventurers, achieving greatness for their mighty deeds and notoriety for their barbaric customs and savage fury.": "无论是在强大的术士领导下的团结，还是在多年冲突后的僵持，兽人和人类部落有时会形成联盟，联合成一个更大的部落，让附近的文明土地感到恐惧。当这些联盟被婚姻所密封时，半兽人就诞生了。一些半兽人崛起，成为兽人部落的骄傲首领，他们的人类血统使他们比全血统的兽人对手更有优势。有些则冒险进入世界，在人类和其他文明种族中证明自己的价值。其中许多人成为了冒险家，因其强大的行为而成就了伟大的事业，因其野蛮的习俗和野蛮的愤怒而声名远扬。",
	"Half-orcs' grayish pigmentation, sloping foreheads, jutting jaws, prominent teeth, and towering builds make their orcish heritage plain for all to see. Half-orcs stand between 6 and 7 feet tall and usually weigh between 180 and 250 pounds.": "半兽人的灰色色素，倾斜的额头，突起的下巴，突出的牙齿，以及高耸的身材，使他们的兽人遗产一目了然。半兽人身高在6到7英尺之间，体重通常在180到250磅之间。",
	"Orcs regard battle scars as tokens or pride and ornamental scars as things of beauty. Other scars, though, mark an Orc, or half-orc as a former slave or a disgraced exile. Any half-orc who has lived among or near orcs has scars, whether they are marks of humiliation or of pride, recounting their past exploits and injuries. Such a half-orc living among humans might display these scars proudly or hide them in shame.": "兽人把战斗的伤疤看作是骄傲的象征，把装饰性的伤疤看作是美丽的东西。但其他的伤疤则标志着一个半兽人或半兽人曾经是一个奴隶或一个失宠的流亡者。任何生活在兽人中或靠近兽人的半兽人都有疤痕，不管是羞辱的还是骄傲的，都会记述他们过去的功绩和伤害。这样一个生活在人类中的半兽人可能会骄傲地展示这些伤疤，也可能会羞愧地隐藏它们。",
	"The one-eyed god Gruumsh created the Orcs, and even those orcs who turn away from his worship can't fully escape his influence. The same is true of half orcs, though their human blood moderates the impact of their orcish heritage. Some half-orcs hear the whispers of Grummsh in their dreams, calling them to unleash the rage that simmers within them. Others feel Gruumsh's exultation when they join in melee combat-and either exult along with him or shiver with fear and loathing. Half-orcs are not evil by nature, but evil does lurk within them, whether they embrace it or rebel against it.": "独眼神格鲁姆什创造了兽人，即使那些背离了他的崇拜的兽人也无法完全摆脱他的影响。半兽人也是如此，尽管他们的人类血统缓和了他们兽人遗产的影响。一些半兽人在梦中听到格鲁姆什的低语，呼唤他们释放内心的怒火。其他半兽人在加入近战时感受到格鲁姆什的喜悦--要么和他一起欢呼，要么因恐惧和厌恶而颤抖。半兽人本质上并不邪恶，但邪恶确实潜伏在他们体内，无论他们是拥抱它还是反抗它。",
	"Beyond the rage of Gruumsh, half-orcs feel emotion powerfully. Rage doesn't just quicken their pulse, it makes their bodies burn. An insult stings like acid, and sadness saps their strength. But they laugh loudly and heartily, and simple bodily pleasures-feasting, drinking, wrestling, drumming, and wild dancing-fill their hearts with joy. They tend to be short tempered and sometimes sullen, more inclined to action than contemplation and to fighting than arguing. The most accomplished half-orcs are those with enough self control to get by in a civilized land.": "除了格鲁姆什的愤怒，半兽人对情感的感受也很强烈。愤怒不仅使他们的脉搏加快，而且使他们的身体燃烧。侮辱像酸一样刺痛他们，而悲伤则消磨他们的力量。 他们的脾气往往很急躁，有时还很沉闷，更倾向于行动而不是沉思，更倾向于战斗而不是争论。最有成就的半兽人是那些有足够的自我控制能力在文明的土地上生存的人。",
	"Half-orcs usually have names appropriate to the culture in which they were raised. A half-orc who wants to fit in among humans might trade an orc name for a human name. Some half-orcs with human names decide to adopt a guttural orc name because they think it makes them more intimidating.": "半兽人通常有适合他们成长的文化的名字。一个想融入人类的半兽人可能会用兽人的名字换成人类的名字。一些有人类名字的半兽人决定采用口齿不清的兽人名字，因为他们认为这让他们更有威慑力。",
	"Dench, Feng, Gell, Henk, Holg, Imsh, Keth, Krusk, Mhurren, Ront, Shump, Thokk": "Dench, Feng, Gell, Henk, Holg, Imsh, Keth, Krusk, Mhurren, Ront, Shump, Thokk",

	"Each half-orc finds a way to gain acceptance from those who hate orcs. Some are reserved, trying not to draw attention to themselves. A few demonstrate piety and good-heartedness as publicly as they can (whether or not such demonstrations are genuine). And some simply try to be so tough that others just avoid them.": "每个半兽人都能找到一种方法来获得那些讨厌兽人的人的认可。有些人很矜持，试图不引起别人的注意。少数人尽可能地公开展示虔诚和善意（无论这种展示是否真实）。还有一些人只是试图表现得非常强硬，以至于别人都避而远之。",
	"The comforts of home are the goals of most halflings' lives: a place to settle in peace and quiet, far from marauding monsters and clashing armies; a blazing fire and a generous meal; fine drink and fine conversation. Though some halflings live out their days in remote agricultural communities, others form nomadic bands that travel constantly, lured by the open road and the wide horizon to discover the wonders of new lands and peoples. But even these wanderers love peace, food, hearth, and home, though home might be a wagon jostling along an dirt road or a raft floating downriver.": "舒适的家是大多数半身人生活的目标：一个可以安居乐业的地方，远离掠夺的怪物和冲突的军队；熊熊的火焰和丰盛的食物；美味的饮料和美好的谈话。虽然有些半身人在偏远的农业社区度过他们的日子，但其他半身人组成的游牧队不断旅行，被开放的道路和广阔的地平线所吸引，去发现新土地和新民族的奇迹。但即使是这些流浪者也热爱和平、食物、炉灶和家，尽管家可能是一辆在土路上颠簸的马车或漂流的木筏。",
	"The diminutive halflings survive in a world full of larger creatures by avoiding notice or, barring that, avoiding offense. Standing about 3 feet tall, they appear relatively harmless and so have managed to survive for centuries in the shadow of empires and on the edges of wars and political strife. They are inclined to be stout, weighing between 40 and 45 pounds.": "矮小的半身人在一个充满大型生物的世界里通过避免被注意，或者说，避免被攻击来生存。他们身高约3英尺，看起来相对无害，因此能够在帝国的阴影下、在战争和政治纷争的边缘生存了几个世纪。他们倾向于粗壮，体重在40至45磅之间。",
	"Halflings' skin ranges from tan to pale with a ruddy cast, and their hair is usually brown or sandy brown and wavy. They have brown or hazel eyes. Halfling men often sport long sideburns, but beards are rare among them and mustaches even more so. They like to wear simple, comfortable, and practical clothes, favoring bright colors.": "半身人的皮肤从棕褐色到苍白，带有红润的色彩，他们的头发通常是棕色或沙棕色，呈波浪形。他们有棕色或淡褐色的眼睛。半身人的男人常常留着长长的鬓角，但他们中很少有胡须，胡须更是如此。他们喜欢穿简单、舒适、实用的衣服，喜欢鲜艳的颜色。",
	"Halfling practicality extends beyond their clothing. They're concerned with basic needs and simple pleasures and have little use for ostentation. Even the wealthiest of halflings keep their treasures locked in a cellar rather than on display for all to see. They have a knack for finding the most straightforward solution to a problem, and have little patience for dithering.": "半身人的实用性超出了他们的服装。他们关注的是基本需求和简单的快乐，对浮夸的东西没什么用。即使是最富有的半身人也把他们的财宝锁在地窖里，而不是展示给所有人看。他们善于为问题找到最直接的解决方案，对犹豫不决没有什么耐心。",
	"Halflings are an affable and cheerful people. They cherish the bonds of family and friendship as well as the comforts of hearth and home, harboring few dreams of gold or glory. Even adventurers among them usually venture into the world for reasons of community, friendship, wanderlust, or curiosity. They love discovering new things, even simple things, such as an exotic food or an unfamiliar style of clothing.": "半身人是一个和蔼可亲、性格开朗的民族。他们珍视家庭和友谊的纽带，以及炉灶和家庭的舒适，很少怀有黄金或荣耀的梦想。即使是他们中的冒险家，通常也会因为社区、友谊、流浪欲或好奇心的原因而冒险进入世界。他们喜欢发现新事物，即使是简单的事物，如异国的食物或陌生的服装风格。",
	"Halflings are easily moved to pity and hate to see any living thing suffer. They are generous, happily sharing what they have even in lean times.": "半身人很容易产生怜悯之心，讨厌看到任何生物受苦。他们很慷慨，即使在贫穷的时候也很乐意分享他们所拥有的东西。",
	"Halflings are adept at fitting into a community of humans, dwarves, or elves, making themselves valuable and welcome. The combination of their inherent stealth and their unassuming nature helps halflings to avoid unwanted attention.": "半身人善于融入人类、矮人或精灵的社区，使自己有价值并受到欢迎。他们与生俱来的隐蔽性和不显眼的天性相结合，有助于半身人避免不必要的关注。",

Some halfling communities travel as a way of life, driving wagons or guiding boats from place to place and maintaining no permanent home.": "许多半身人生活在其他种族中，半身人的辛勤工作和忠诚的态度为他们提供了丰富的回报和舒适的生活环境。一些半身人社区把旅行作为一种生活方式，驾驶马车或引导船只从一个地方到另一个地方，没有固定的家。",

	"Hobgoblins trace their origins to the ancient courts of the Feywild, where they first appeared with their goblin and bugbear kin. Many of them were driven from the Feywild by the conquering god Maglubiyet, who marshaled them as soldiers, but the fey realm left its mark; wherever they are in the multiverse, they continue to channel an aspect of the Feywild's rule of reciprocity, which creates a mystical bond between the giver and the receiver of a gift.": "霍布林的起源可以追溯到古代的仙界法庭，在那里他们第一次和他们的地精和虫熊亲属一起出现。他们中的许多人被征服者马格鲁比耶特（Maglubiyet）赶出了仙界，后者将他们作为士兵召集起来，但仙界留下了它的印记；无论他们在多元宇宙的什么地方，他们都会继续引导仙界互惠规则的一个方面，在礼物的赠送者和接受者之间建立一种神秘的联系。",

	"In the reckonings of most worlds, humans are the youngest of the common races, late to arrive on the world scene and short-lived in comparison to dwarves, elves, and dragons. Perhaps it is because of their shorter lives that they strive to achieve as much as they can in the years they are given. Or maybe they feel they have something to prove to the elder races, and that's why they build their mighty empires on the foundation of conquest and trade. Whatever drives them, humans are the innovators, the achievers, and the pioneers of the worlds.": "在大多数世界的计算中，人类是最年轻的普通种族，与矮人、精灵和龙相比，他们到达世界舞台的时间较晚，寿命较短。也许正是因为他们的寿命较短，所以他们努力在他们被给予的岁月中尽可能多地实现自己。也可能是他们觉得自己有东西要向长者种族证明，这就是为什么他们要在征服和贸易的基础上建立自己强大的帝国。不管他们的动力是什么，人类都是创新者、成就者和世界的开拓者。",
	"With their penchant for migration and conquest, humans are more physically diverse than other common races. There is no typical human. An individual can stand from 5 feet to a little over 6 feet tall and weigh from 125 to 250 pounds. Human skin shades range from nearly black to very pale, and hair colors from black to blond (curly, kinky, or straight); males might sport facial hair that is sparse or thick. A lot of humans have a dash of nonhuman blood, revealing hints of elf, orc, or other lineages. Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and rarely live even a single century.": "由于喜欢迁徙和征服，人类在身体上比其他普通种族更加多样化。没有典型的人类。一个人的身高可以从5英尺到6英尺多一点，体重从125磅到250磅。人类的皮肤色调从近乎黑色到非常苍白，头发颜色从黑色到金色（卷曲的、扭结的或直的）；男性的面部毛发可能是稀疏的或浓密的。很多人类都有一点非人类的血统，透露出精灵、兽人或其他血统的暗示。人类在十几岁的时候就成年了，甚至很少能活到一个世纪。",
	"Humans are the most adaptable and ambitious people among the common races. They have widely varying tastes, morals, and customs in the many different lands where they have settled. When they settle, though, they stay: they build cities to last for the ages, and great kingdoms that can persist for long centuries. An individual human might have a relatively short life span, but a human nation or culture preserves traditions with origins far beyond the reach of any single human's memory. They live fully in the present-making them well suited to the adventuring life-but also plan for the future, striving to leave a lasting legacy. Individually and as a group, humans are adaptable opportunists, and they stay alert to changing political and social dynamics.": "人类是普通种族中最具适应性和雄心的人。在他们定居的许多不同的土地上，他们的品味、道德和习俗有很大的差异。不过，当他们定居后，他们就会留下来：他们建立的城市可以持续数年，而伟大的王国则可以持续数个世纪之久。一个单独的人类可能有相对较短的寿命，但一个人类国家或文化所保留的传统，其起源远远超出了任何一个人类的记忆范围。他们完全活在当下，这使他们很适合冒险生活，但也为未来做打算，努力留下持久的遗产。无论是个体还是群体，人类都是适应性强的机会主义者，他们对不断变化的政治和社会动态保持警惕。",
	"Where a single elf or dwarf might take on the responsibility of guarding a special location or a powerful secret, humans found sacred orders and institutions for such purposes. While dwarf clans and halfling elders pass on the ancient traditions to each new generation, human temples, governments, libraries, and codes of law fix their traditions in the bedrock of history. Humans dream of immortality, but (except for those few who seek undeath or divine ascension to escape death's clutches) they achieve it by ensuring that they will be remembered when they are gone.": "单个精灵或矮人可能会承担起守卫一个特殊地点或强大秘密的责任，而人类则为这种目的找到了神圣的命令和机构。当矮人氏族和半身人的长老将古老的传统传给每一代人时，人类的寺庙、政府、图书馆和法典则将其传统固定在历史的基石上。人类梦想着长生不老，但（除了那些寻求不死或神灵升天以逃脱死亡魔掌的少数人）他们通过确保在他们离开后会被记住来实现。",

	"Having so much more variety than other cultures, humans as a whole have no typical names.

	"The material culture and physical characteristics of humans can change wildly from region to region.

	"Of the five humanoid races of Amonkhet, humans are the most diverse and adaptable. Different humans train in a wide variety of fighting styles, including those particularly favored by other races. A human mage might use any of the five colors of mana, while mages of other races focus on one of only two colors. Human {@background vizier|psa|viziers} serve all five gods, and different human {@background initiate|psa|initiates} excel in different trials. Humans defy trends and categorization, and opponents who face a human in one-on-one combat can't know what kind of fight to expect—from the foresight and cunning often associated with Kefnet, to a ruthlessness that emulates Bontu. At the beginning of such a fight, this uncertainty can give an edge to the human combatant.": "在阿蒙凯特的五个人形种族中，人类是最多样化和适应性最强的。不同的人类训练出各种各样的战斗方式，包括那些特别受其他种族青睐的方式。人类法师可能使用五种颜色的法力中的任何一种，而其他种族的法师只专注于两种颜色中的一种。人类（%0%）服务于所有五个神，不同的人类（%1%）擅长于不同的试验。人类藐视潮流和分类，在一对一的战斗中面对人类的对手不知道该期待什么样的战斗--从通常与凯夫奈特相关的预见性和狡猾，到模仿邦图的无情性。在这种战斗的开始阶段，这种不确定性会给人类战斗者带来优势。",
	"Once the fight has begun, of course, victory relies on different factors. But here, the human drive toward perfection once more tilts the scales in their favor. Humans are willing to go to any length, exhausting all available options, to reach the pinnacle of achievement and win the favor of the God-Pharaoh.": "当然，一旦战斗开始，胜利就取决于不同的因素。但在这里，人类追求完美的动力再一次使天平向他们倾斜。人类愿意不惜一切代价，用尽所有可用的选择，以达到成就的顶峰，赢得上帝-法老的青睐。",
	"As diverse as they are in most respects, the humans of Amonkhet share a drive toward perfection. However, they approach this challenge differently. Some humans specialize in a relatively narrow set of skills, while others seek to master a wide range.": "尽管他们在大多数方面都是不同的，但阿蒙凯特的人类都有一种追求完美的动力。然而，他们对待这一挑战的方式不同。有些人专注于一套相对狭窄的技能，而其他人则寻求掌握广泛的技能。",
	"Humans who choose a path of specialization often piously identify with one of the five gods (often as a {@background vizier|psa}), and thus focus on one aspect of perfection. For them, the best way to earn a place in the afterlife is to hone a single facet of their character to the utmost quality, and as {@background initiate|psa|initiates}, they hope to put that quality to use in all five trials. A mage {@background initiate|psa} who identifies with Hazoret might cultivate zeal above all other virtues, master spells of fiery magic to channel that powerful emotion, and rely on raw energy and enthusiasm to get through the four trials leading up to Hazoret's final test. An {@background initiate|psa} dedicated to Oketra, on the other hand, relies on cooperation, solidarity, and teamwork to get through the trials—even Bontu's Trial of Ambition, which attempts to break down such bonds. To Oketra's disciple, ambition means a drive to help an entire crop of initiates achieve glory together, rather than exalting oneself over others. Humans with this viewpoint see their chosen virtue coloring all others, and believe that the five gods offer their people a choice of which virtue to emulate and emphasize.": "选择专业化道路的人类往往虔诚地认同五神之一（通常是作为{@background vizier|psa}），因此专注于完美的一个方面。对他们来说，在来世赢得一席之地的最好方法是将他们性格中的一个方面磨练到极致，作为{@background initiate|psa|initiates}，他们希望将这种品质运用到所有的五种考验中。一个认同Hazoret的法师（%2%）可能会培养出高于其他所有美德的热情，掌握火热的魔法咒语来引导这种强大的情感，并依靠原始的能量和热情来通过Hazoret的最终测试前的四个考验。另一方面，一个献给奥克拉的{@background initiate|psa}，依靠合作、团结和团队精神来度过考验--甚至是邦图的野心考验，试图打破这种联系。对奥克拉的弟子来说，野心意味着帮助整批入门者共同获得荣耀的动力，而不是让自己高高在上。持这种观点的人类认为他们选择的美德为所有其他美德着色，并认为五神为他们的人民提供了一个选择，让他们效仿和强调哪种美德。",
	"Other humans believe that true perfection lies in mastering all the virtues, without giving preference to any one over the others. They compare themselves to multifaceted stones whose beauty lies in the polished perfection of every facet. These humans are careful not to let their skills in one area outshine their other efforts, and if they grow too accomplished in one set of skills, they set it aside to concentrate their training on others until their abilities are in balance once more.": "其他人类认为，真正的完美在于掌握所有的美德，而不偏重任何一种。他们把自己比作多面体的宝石，其美在于每一个面都打磨得很完美。这些人很小心，不要让他们在一个领域的技能超过他们的其他努力，如果他们在一套技能上的成就太高，他们会把它放在一边，集中训练其他技能，直到他们的能力再次达到平衡。",
	"Philosophically, such humans believe that the gods are five in number so as to remind the people of Amonkhet not to focus their attention on a single god or a single virtue, but to serve the gods equally and master their teachings to the same degree. Thus they hope to achieve a balanced state of perfection that will guarantee their admission into the afterlife.": "在哲学上，这样的人类认为，诸神有五个，以便提醒阿蒙凯特的人们不要把注意力集中在单一的神或单一的美德上，而是要平等地服务于诸神，并在同等程度上掌握他们的教义。因此，他们希望达到一种平衡的完美状态，以保证他们能进入来世。",
	"Most human initiates focus their studies on a single specialization—hand-to-hand combat, long-range combat, or magical combat.

Other hand-to-hand specialists take a broader perspective and study the use of all weapons equally.": "大多数人类入门者将他们的学习重点放在一个单一的专业上，即徒手格斗、远程格斗或魔法格斗。选择徒手格斗的人类可能会一心一意地专注于镰刀刃的khopesh的使用（视作{@item longsword|phb}）。其他徒手搏击专家则采取更广泛的视角，平等地研究所有武器的使用。",
	"Some humans, however, apply the idea of perfection through balance to these combat specializations as well, fusing multiple styles together into a unique blend. For example, a human initiate might use spells to shape sand into a sword or to wreathe arrows with life-draining magic. Other initiates strike with an axe in one hand while throwing smaller axes with the other, employing techniques of both hand-to-hand and long-range combat. Some humans use slings to launch fireballs, create illusory nets to restrain their opponents, or craft their blades from solid toxins.": "然而，一些人类也将通过平衡实现完美的理念应用于这些战斗专业，将多种风格融合在一起，形成一种独特的混合。例如，人类的入门者可能会使用法术将沙子塑造成一把剑，或者用消耗生命的魔法来缠绕箭矢。其他入门者一手拿斧头，一手投掷较小的斧头，采用徒手和远距离战斗的技术。一些人类使用吊索发射火球，创造虚幻的网来限制他们的对手，或者用固体毒素制作他们的刀片。",
	"Humans are the most numerous, diverse, and adaptable folk of Zendikar, and they form the core of most exploratory and adventurous expeditions across the plane.

As the Eldrazi spread, more and more humans are driven out of their refuges and forced to confront the harsh reality of that alien threat.": "人类是赞迪卡星球上数量最多、种类最多、适应性最强的民族，他们是整个星球上大多数探索和冒险探险的核心。尽管许多人类蜷缩在石墙和木制城墙后面，至少在某种程度上受到保护，不受赞迪卡危险的影响，但仍有相当多的人冒险离开安全的城墙去探索和保卫他们的世界。随着埃尔德拉兹的蔓延，越来越多的人类被赶出了他们的避难所，并被迫面对这个外来威胁的残酷现实。",
	"Most human communities on Zendikar are tiny villages, remote outposts, or temporary encampments. These settlements are found on every continent, from the coastal villages of Guul Draz to the giant caravan of Goma Fada on Akoum. Without the safety of walls and ramparts, frontier life is all about the struggle for survival, leaving little time or energy for scholarly pursuits. The people of most of these communities rely on hunting, gathering, herding, and trading for the food and other goods they need. Some, however, survive by preying on the people of other communities and caravans.": "赞迪卡上的大多数人类社区都是小村庄、偏远的前哨站或临时营地。这些定居点在每个大陆上都能找到，从古尔-德拉兹的沿海村庄到阿库姆的戈马法达的巨大商队。没有城墙和壁垒的安全，边疆的生活都是为了生存而奋斗，几乎没有时间或精力去追求学术研究。这些社区中的大多数人依靠打猎、采集、放牧和交易来获得他们所需的食物和其他物品。然而，有些人则通过掠夺其他社区和商队的人而生存。",
	"Despite the harshness of life on Zendikar, human civilization flourishes in a few scattered towns. Sea Gate (on the continent of Tazeem), Affa Town (on Akoum), and the so-called Free City of Nimana (in Guul Draz) are the most notable of these, boasting organized military forces, institutions of learning, established traditions of magic, houses of worship, and dark underbellies of crime and corruption. With populations measured in the thousands, these settlements would barely qualify as towns on other planes, but they have no rivals on Zendikar except the vampire city of Malakir—which has been in ruins since the emergence of the Eldrazi.": "尽管赞迪卡大陆上的生活十分严酷，但人类文明却在一些分散的城镇中蓬勃发展。海门（位于塔泽姆大陆）、阿法镇（位于阿库姆）和所谓的尼玛纳自由城（位于古尔-德拉兹）是其中最引人注目的，它们拥有有组织的军队、学习机构、成熟的魔法传统、礼拜场所，以及犯罪和腐败的阴暗面。这些定居点的人口数以千计，在其他位面几乎没有资格成为城镇，但他们在赞迪卡没有对手，除了吸血鬼城市马拉基尔--自从艾尔德拉兹出现后，它就成了废墟。",

Named for the destinations of their first expeditions, they are the Valakut House, the Pelakka Foundation, and the Akoum, Murasa, and Bala Ged Expeditionary Houses. The rivalries among the houses are legendary, and they are known to sabotage each other's expeditions. Each maintains hostels in various settlements, which serve as resources for adventurers and explorers who need to hire guides or purchase supplies.": "在海之门，有五个所谓的远征屋为了不同的目的定期到荒野中进行远征活动。它们以第一次探险的目的地命名，分别是瓦拉库特家族、佩拉卡基金会、阿库姆、穆拉萨和巴拉格德探险家族。这些房屋之间的竞争是传奇性的，他们以破坏对方的探险活动而闻名。每家都在不同的定居点设有旅馆，作为冒险家和探险家需要雇用向导或购买物资的资源。",
	"I am kalashtar, born of two worlds. Over a thousand years ago, my ancestor bound her bloodline to the spirit Kashtai, and I am a child of that union. Kashtai moves within me.

As long as at least one of my sisters is alive, Kashtai will survive—and as long as she lives, she will fight il-Lashtavar.": "我是卡拉什塔，诞生于两个世界。一千多年前，我的祖先将她的血脉与卡什塔伊精神结合在一起，而我是这种结合的孩子。卡施泰在我体内活动。她的记忆在梦中向我走来，有时她的声音在我脑海的寂静中低语。只要我的姐妹中至少有一个人活着，卡什塔伊就会生存下去--只要她活着，她就会与拉什塔瓦战斗。",
	"The kalashtar are a compound people, created from the union of humanity and renegade spirits from the plane of dreams—spirits called quori.

There is an unmistakable alien quality to the kalashtar, though, as they are haunted by the conflicts of their otherworldly spirits.": "卡拉什塔人是一个复合民族，由人类和来自梦境层面的叛逆精神--被称为 \"quori \"的精神--结合而成。卡拉什塔人通常被视为有智慧、有灵性的人，对他人有极大的同情心。不过，卡拉什塔人有一种明确无误的外星品质，因为他们被其他世界的灵魂的冲突所困扰。",
	"Every kalashtar has a connection to a spirit of light, a bond shared by other members of their bloodline. Kalashtar appear human, but their spiritual connection affects them in a variety of ways. Kalashtar have symmetrical, slightly angular features, and their eyes often glow when they are focused or expressing strong emotions.": "每个卡拉什塔人都与光明之灵有联系，这是他们血统中其他成员共享的纽带。卡拉什塔人看起来是人类，但他们的精神联系以各种方式影响着他们。卡拉什塔人有对称的、略带棱角的特征，当他们专注或表达强烈的情感时，他们的眼睛往往会发光。",
	"Kalashtar can't directly communicate with their quori spirits. Rather, they might experience this relationship as a sense of instinct and inspiration, drawing on the memories of the spirit when they dream. This connection grants kalashtar minor psionic abilities, as well as protection from psychic attacks. All of these quori dream-spirits are virtuous, but some are warriors and others are more contemplative. Work together with the DM to determine the nature of your linked spirit. Typically, a kalashtar knows the name and nature of their spirit, but some may know nothing of their spirit or the source of their psychic gifts, such as an orphan kalashtar raised among strangers.": "卡拉什塔人不能直接与他们的库里精神沟通。相反，他们可能会把这种关系体验为一种本能和灵感，在做梦时吸取精神的记忆。这种联系赋予卡拉什塔人轻微的幻觉能力，以及对精神攻击的保护。所有这些夸瑞的梦中精灵都是有德行的，但有些是战士，有些则更善于沉思。与DM一起工作，以确定你的链接精神的性质。一般来说，卡拉什塔人知道他们的精神的名字和性质，但有些人可能对他们的精神或他们的精神天赋的来源一无所知，例如在陌生人中长大的孤儿卡拉什塔人。",

Through the force known as the Dreaming Dark, these monsters manipulate the folk of Khorvaire to eliminate kalashtar whenever possible.": "与卡拉什塔联系在一起的美德的灵魂从达尔-库尔的梦境中逃出，以躲避主宰它的恶灵。叛逆的库里相信，通过冥想和奉献，他们可以改变达尔-库尔的基本性质，将平衡从黑暗转向光明。大多数卡拉什塔社区专注于被称为 \"光明之路 \"的虔诚行为。但达尔-库尔的黑暗势力对埃伯龙有自己的计划。通过被称为 \"黑暗之梦 \"的力量，这些怪物操纵着霍尔韦尔的民众，尽可能地消灭卡拉什塔人。",
	"Many kalashtar defend themselves from the Dreaming Dark by focusing on devotion to the Path of Light. Others, though, seek out the agents of the Dreaming Dark and oppose their plans, or protect the innocent however they can. Still other kalashtar grow up isolated, knowing nothing about Dal Quor or the Dreaming Dark. Such orphans might use their abilities for personal gain or otherwise act against the virtuous instincts of their quori spirits; this can cause internal conflicts and violent mood swings.": "许多卡拉什塔人通过专注于对光明之路的奉献来保护自己不受造梦的黑暗影响。然而，其他人则寻找梦幻黑暗的代理人，反对他们的计划，或尽可能地保护无辜者。还有一些卡拉什塔人在成长过程中与世隔绝，对达尔-库尔和梦境的黑暗一无所知。这样的孤儿可能会利用他们的能力谋取私利，或以其他方式违背他们的奎里精神的美德本能；这可能导致内部冲突和剧烈的情绪波动。",

Kender have a supernatural curiosity that drives them on to adventures big and small.

Due to their curiosity, many kender have found themselves falling through gates and portals to other planes and worlds.": "坎德人原产于克莱恩世界，是一种矮小的人形生物，看起来像人类，有着尖尖的耳朵和不同的外表。坎德人有一种超自然的好奇心，促使他们进行大大小小的冒险。这种好奇心据说与精灵世界的异想天开的魔法有关，有人认为坎德人对这种魔法有很强的亲和力。由于他们的好奇心，许多坎德人发现自己通过大门和传送门掉到了其他星球和世界。",

	"Feathered folk who resemble ravens, kenku are blessed with keen observation and supernaturally accurate memories. None of them can remember the origin of the first kenku, however, and they often joke that there are as many kenku origin stories as there are kenku.

Other kenku recite cryptic but beautiful poems about their advent being a blessed event in which they were sent into the multiverse to observe and catalog its many wonders.": "像乌鸦一样的羽民，Kenku被赋予了敏锐的观察力和超自然的准确记忆。然而，没有人记得第一个Kenku的起源，他们经常开玩笑说，有多少Kenku的起源故事就有多少Kenku。他们中的一些人把自己的起源描绘成一种诅咒，作为一个不会飞的鸟人，注定要模仿其他人的创造。其他的肯库人则背诵神秘但美丽的诗歌，说他们的出现是一个受祝福的事件，他们被派往多元宇宙观察和记录其许多奇迹。",
	"Whatever their true origin, kenku are most often found in the Shadowfell and the Material Plane, and they tend to have the coloration typical of ravens.": "无论它们的真正来源是什么，肯库最常在阴影地带和物质界被发现，它们往往有典型的乌鸦的颜色。",

	"Unfortunately for the kenku, their master discovered their plan before they could enact it. Enraged, the entity imposed three dreadful curses upon them. First, the kenku's beloved wings withered and fell away from their bodies, leaving them bound to the earth. Second, because their ingenuity and skill had turned toward scheming against their patron, the spark of creativity was torn from their souls. Finally, to ensure that the kenku could never divulge any secrets, their master took away their voices. Once the entity was satisfied that they had been sufficiently punished, the kenku were set loose on the Material Plane.": "对Kenku来说，不幸的是，他们的主人在他们实施计划之前就发现了他们的计划。实体被激怒了，对他们施加了三个可怕的诅咒。首先，Kenku心爱的翅膀枯萎并从他们的身体上脱落，让他们被束缚在地上。其次，由于他们的聪明才智和技能转向了对其赞助人的阴谋，创造力的火花从他们的灵魂中被撕毁。最后，为了确保Kenku永远不会泄露任何秘密，他们的主人剥夺了他们的声音。一旦实体对他们受到足够的惩罚感到满意，Kenku就被释放到物质世界。",
	"Since then, the kenku have wandered the world. They settle in places that accept them, usually bleak cities that have fallen on hard times and are overrun with crime.": "从那时起，Kenku在世界范围内游荡。他们在接受他们的地方定居，通常是那些已经陷入困境、犯罪猖獗的荒凉城市。",
	"Above all else, kenku wish to regain their ability to fly. Every kenku is born with a desire to take to the air, and those who learn spellcasting do so in hope of mastering spells that will allow them to fly. Rumors of magic items such as flying carpets, brooms capable of flight, and similar objects provoke a great desire for the kenku to acquire the items for themselves.": "最重要的是，肯库希望恢复他们的飞行能力。每个肯库人天生就有飞翔的欲望，而那些学习法术的人则是希望掌握能让他们飞翔的法术。有关魔法物品的传闻，如飞毯、能够飞行的扫帚和类似物品，激起了肯库为自己获得这些物品的巨大欲望。",
	"Despite their lack of wings, kenku love dwelling in towers and other tall structures. They seek out ruins that reach to the sky, though they lack the motivation and creativity to make repairs or fortify such places.

	"As a result of their lack of creativity, kenku function comfortably as minions of a powerful master. Flock leaders enforce discipline and minimize conflicts, but they fail at effective planning or crafting longterm schemes.": "由于缺乏创造力，肯库作为一个强大的主人的爪牙运作起来很舒服。群体领袖执行纪律并尽量减少冲突，但他们不能有效地规划或制定长期计划。",
	"Although unable to speak in their own voices, kenku can perfectly mimic any sound they hear, from a halfling's voice to the noise of rocks clattering down a hillside.

	"By the same token, kenku have no ability to invent new ideas or create new things. Kenku can copy existing items with exceptional skill, allowing them to become excellent artisans and scribes. They can copy books, make replicas of objects, and otherwise thrive in situations where they can produce large numbers of identical items. Few kenku find this work satisfying, since their quest for the freedom of flight makes them ill-suited to settle into a routine.": "同样地，Kenku没有发明新想法或创造新事物的能力。肯库能以特殊的技巧复制现有物品，使他们成为优秀的工匠和文学家。他们可以复制书籍，制作物品的复制品，并在能够生产大量相同物品的情况下茁壮成长。很少有kenku发现这项工作令人满意，因为他们对飞行自由的追求使他们不适合安于常规。",
	"Kenku gather in groups called flocks. A flock is led by the oldest and most experienced kenku with the widest store of knowledge to draw on, often called Master.": "Kenku聚集在一起的群体被称为 \"群\"。一个群体由最年长和最有经验的Kenku领导，拥有最广泛的知识储备，通常被称为主人。",
	"Although kenku can't create new things, they have a talent for learning and memorizing details. Thus, ambitious kenku can excel as superb spies and scouts.

	"For this reason, many kenku make an easy living serving as messengers, spies, and lookouts for thieves' guilds, bandits, and other criminal cartels.

	"Kenku adventurers, despite their relative independence, still have a tendency to seek out a companion to emulate and follow. A kenku loves to mimic the voice and words of its chosen companion.": "Kenku冒险者，尽管他们相对独立，但仍然倾向于寻找一个同伴来模仿和跟随。肯库人喜欢模仿它所选择的同伴的声音和话语。",
	"If you're playing a kenku, constant attempts to mimic noises can come across as confusing or irritating rather than entertaining.

Be clear about your character's intentions unless you're deliberately aiming for inscrutable or mysterious.": "如果你扮演的是一个Kenku，不断尝试模仿声音会让人感到困惑或恼怒，而不是娱乐。你可以很容易地描述你的角色发出的声音和它们的含义。除非你刻意追求高深莫测或神秘，否则要清楚你的角色的意图。",
	"You might say, \"Snapper makes the noise of a hammer slowly and rhythmically tapping a stone to show how bored he is. He plays with his dagger and studies the Lords' Alliance agent sitting at the bar.\" Creating a vocabulary of noises for the other players to decode might sound like fun, but it can prove distracting and could slow down the game.": "你可能会说，\"斯纳普发出锤子缓慢而有节奏地敲击石头的声音，以显示他有多无聊。他玩着他的匕首，研究坐在酒吧的领主联盟代理人。\" 创造一个噪音词汇让其他玩家解码，听起来可能很有趣，但事实证明会分散注意力，并可能拖慢游戏的进程。",

	"Kenku thieves, con artists, and burglars adopt animal noises, typically those common in urban settings.

	"Some kenku turn their back on crime to pursue legitimate trades. These kenku adopt noises made as part of their craft.

	"Nearly every khenra is born a fraternal or identical twin, and a pair of khenra twins forms an extremely close emotional bond unknown to most other residents of Amonkhet. The death of one twin in training or the trials causes a tremendous shock to the survivor, who typically grows more aggressive and foolhardy in battle. The rare khenra who are born without twins are believed to have killed their siblings in the womb, and are thus viewed as natural-born initiates, sure to achieve a glorified death in the Trial of Zeal.": "几乎每一个肯纳人都是天生的异卵双胞胎或同卵双胞胎，一对肯纳双胞胎形成了一种极其紧密的情感纽带，这是阿蒙凯特的大多数其他居民所不知道的。一对双胞胎在训练或试炼中的死亡对幸存者造成了巨大的冲击，他们在战斗中通常会变得更加积极和愚蠢。罕见的没有双胞胎的Khenra被认为是在子宫内杀死了他们的兄弟姐妹，因此被视为天生的入门者，肯定会在狂热的试验中获得光荣的死亡。",
	"Many khenra believe that they are created in the image of Hazoret, and though they venerate all five gods in the manner of all citizens of Naktamun, they have a special affinity for the teachings and philosophy of the god of zeal.

	"The familial bond experienced in the Family Temple of Hazoret's monument is a part of every khenra's experience as one of a pair of twins. As such, these khenra sometimes think of themselves as Hazoret's children even before they finish the fourth trial.

	"Other khenra choose to distance themselves from Hazoret and the reckless battle frenzy she encourages. They devote themselves instead to honing their physical strength, resilience, and adaptability, inspired and guided by the teachings of Rhonas. These khenra have a great fondness for wrestling (or tussling, as they often call it), and they keep careful track of the matches they win and lose against other {@background initiate|psa|initiates}. They often seek out matches against {@race minotaur (amonkhet)|psa|minotaurs}, enjoying the challenge of pitting their sinewy strength against the brute muscle of larger and heavier opponents.": "其他Khenra选择与Hazoret和她鼓励的鲁莽的战斗狂热保持距离。他们转而致力于磨练自己的体力、复原力和适应力，受到罗纳斯教义的启发和指导。这些Khenra非常喜欢摔跤（或者他们常说的扭打），他们仔细记录他们与其他（%0%）的比赛的输赢。他们经常寻找与(1%)的比赛，享受将自己的筋肉力量与更大、更重的对手的蛮力对决的挑战。",

	"Khenra who focus on hand-to-hand combat often wield the khopesh—a large sickle-bladed sword—as their weapon of choice (treat as a {@item longsword|phb}). Khenra wield these blades with devastating accuracy and power, landing one crushing blow after another in a hail of furious attacks. They favor lightweight armor that doesn't impede their movement, often comparing fighting in organized ranks to wearing a leash that limits their ability to charge, lunge, and roll away from danger. Their natural aggression makes them ideal shock troops, scouts, and skirmishers. And that aggression is even more pronounced in khenra who have already lost their twin, and who sometimes lose any sense of self-preservation as a result.": "专注于徒手搏斗的堪拉人经常挥舞着镰刀--一种大型的镰刀剑--作为他们的首选武器（视为{@item longsword|phb}）。堪拉人以毁灭性的准确度和力量挥舞这些剑，在狂暴的攻击中一次又一次地进行粉碎性打击。他们喜欢不妨碍他们行动的轻量级盔甲，经常把在有组织的队伍中作战比作戴着一条限制他们冲锋、猛冲和滚开危险的皮带。他们天生的攻击性使他们成为理想的冲击部队、侦察兵和小兵。而这种攻击性在已经失去双胞胎的Khenra身上更加明显，他们有时会因此失去任何自我保护的意识。",
	"Khenra who focus on long-range combat prefer hurled weapons—spears and javelins—over bows and slings, and they are known and feared for their deadly accuracy. They carry small cases of {@item javelin|phb|javelins} into combat, and feel ashamed if they reach the end of a battle with any weapons left unthrown. A khenra might ride on a {@item chariot|phb} as a {@item spear|phb} thrower, sometimes augmenting attacks with minor spells of fire magic.": "专注于远程作战的Khenra更喜欢投掷武器--长矛和标枪--而不是弓箭和弹弓，他们因其致命的准确性而闻名和畏惧。他们在战斗中携带小箱的{@item javelin|phb|javelins}武器，如果他们在战斗结束时没有扔掉任何武器，他们会感到羞愧。Khenra可能会骑在(1%)上作为(2%)投掷者，有时会用小的火系魔法来增强攻击。",
	"Many khenra mages specialize in fire spells, creating blades or hails of flame to sear and scorch their foes. Their strategy emphasizes overwhelming initial assaults, in magical emulation of Hazoret's battle frenzy. Others prefer magic that augments their natural speed and strength, bolsters their endurance, or drains strength from their enemies. They work to hone their spells alongside their bodies, incorporating elements of hand-to-hand combat into their spellcasting.": "许多坎拉法师擅长火系法术，创造出火焰之刃或火焰之帆来灼伤和烧毁他们的敌人。他们的策略强调压倒性的初始攻击，在魔法上模仿哈佐雷特的战斗狂热。其他人则更喜欢用魔法增强他们的自然速度和力量，提高他们的耐力，或消耗敌人的力量。他们努力磨练自己的法术和身体，将徒手搏斗的元素融入他们的法术。",
	"Some of the smallest draconic creatures in the multiverse, kobolds display their draconic ancestry in the glint of their scales and in their roars. Legends tell of the first kobolds emerging from the Underdark near the lairs of the earliest dragons. In some lands, kobolds serve chromatic or metallic dragons—even worshiping them as divine beings. In other places, kobolds know too well how dangerous those dragons can be and help others defend against draconic destruction.": "哥布林是多元宇宙中最小的龙族生物，他们的鳞片和吼声都显示出他们的龙族血统。传说中，第一批哥布林是从最早的龙的巢穴附近的地下世界出现的。在一些地方，哥布林为色龙或金属龙服务，甚至把它们当作神圣的存在来崇拜。在其他地方，哥布林太了解这些龙有多危险了，于是帮助其他人抵御龙族的破坏。",
	"Whatever their relationship to dragons, kobold scales tend to be rust colored, although the occasional kobold sports a scale color more akin to that of a chromatic or a metallic dragon. A kobold's cry can express a range of emotion: anger, resolve, elation, fear, and more. Regardless of the emotion expressed, their cry resonates with draconic power.": "不管他们与龙的关系如何，哥布林的鳞片往往是铁锈色的，尽管偶尔有哥布林的鳞片颜色更类似于色龙或金属龙的颜色。哥布林的哭声可以表达一系列的情绪：愤怒、决心、欣喜、恐惧，等等。无论表达何种情绪，他们的哭声都能与龙的力量产生共鸣。",

	"Deeply reverent of the land and its sacred sites, the nomadic kor live a spare existence defined by their constant travels. Masters of ropes and hooks, they scale sheer cliffs and cross yawning chasms with such skill and agility that they sometimes seem almost to take flight.": "游牧的科尔人对土地和圣地怀有深深的敬意，他们的生活因不断的旅行而变得清闲。他们是绳索和钩子的大师，以如此娴熟的技巧和敏捷的身手攀登峭壁，穿越巨大的鸿沟，有时几乎要飞起来。",
	"Kor are associated with white mana, and their wizards and clerics employ spells of healing, of banishing the dark, and of protection. Their personalities and ideals also mesh with the characteristics of white mana in their emphasis on an ordered, harmonious community with strong traditions binding its members together.": "科尔族与白法力有关，他们的巫师和牧师使用治疗、驱逐黑暗和保护的法术。他们的个性和理想也与白玛瑙的特征相吻合，他们强调有序、和谐的社区，有强大的传统将其成员联系在一起。",
	"Kor are tall, slender humanoids with light hair and gray, blue-gray, or ivory skin. All kor have slightly pointed ears, and males have short, fleshy barbels on their chins. They paint softly glowing geometric patterns on their faces and bodies, suggestive of the shapes and design of the hedrons that appear across Zendikar. Their clothing tends to leave their arms and shoulders free to facilitate climbing, and they keep most of their gear in pouches and slings at their waists.": "科尔是高大、纤细的人形动物，有浅色的头发和灰色、蓝灰色或象牙色的皮肤。所有科尔人都有略微尖尖的耳朵，男性的下巴上有短而肉质的倒钩。他们在脸上和身上画着柔和的几何图案，让人联想到出现在整个赞迪卡的赫龙的形状和设计。他们的衣服倾向于让他们的手臂和肩膀自由，以方便攀爬，他们把大部分装备放在腰间的小袋和吊索里。",
	"The kor have a nonverbal language of hand signs and gestures that allows communication despite significant distance (particularly when augmented with whirling ropes) or howling winds. They also use this sign language among themselves when they wish to avoid being overheard, giving rise to misguided rumors that they are incapable of speech. When they do speak, they typically use as few words as possible to convey their meaning.": "科尔人有一种由手势和姿态组成的非语言语言，尽管距离很远（特别是在有旋转绳索的情况下）或有呼啸的风，但仍能进行交流。当他们希望避免被人听到时，他们也会在彼此之间使用这种手语，这引起了关于他们不能说话的错误传言。当他们说话时，他们通常用尽可能少的词来表达他们的意思。",
	"The leonin guard the shining lands of Oreskos, a golden plain where even the gods rarely trespass.

	"Leonin tend to be tall compared to humans and move with a boldness that suggests their physical might. Tawny fur covers leonin bodies, and some grow thick manes ranging in shades from gold to black. While their hands prove as nimble as those of other humanoids, leonin have retractable feline claws, which they can extend instantly. This, along with their ability to produce bone-shaking roars, gives most leonin an air that readily shifts between regal and fearsome.": "与人类相比，莱昂人往往很高大，而且行动大胆，显示出他们的身体力量。灰褐色的皮毛覆盖着利奥宁人的身体，一些人长出了从金色到黑色的浓密鬃毛。虽然他们的手被证明和其他人类一样灵活，但利安人有可伸缩的猫科动物爪子，他们可以立即伸展。这一点，加上他们能够发出震耳欲聋的吼声，使大多数利安人具有一种在威严和可怕之间轻易转换的气质。",

	"It follows, too, that leonin aren't inclined to carry grudges. A warrior might react with sudden violence to an insult, but when the fight is over (and the leonin's superiority proven), the insult is forgotten—along with the vanquished foe.": "这也说明，利安人并不倾向于带着怨恨。一个战士可能会对侮辱做出突然的暴力反应，但当战斗结束时（并且证明了利安人的优势），侮辱就会被遗忘--和被征服的敌人一起。",
	"Few leonin devote themselves to the service of the gods. Centuries ago, the leonin worshiped the same gods that humans do, but after many of their prides suffered depravities at the hands of the tyrant Agnomakhos, most leonin rejected the gods. It's not that they deny the existence of deities; they merely see the gods as mercurial and ultimately unworthy of adoration. The Leonin and the Gods table suggests the range of attitudes that leonin might adopt toward the gods.": "很少有列宁人献身于神灵的服务。几个世纪以前，利安人崇拜的是和人类一样的神，但在他们的许多王族在暴君阿格诺玛科斯手中遭受蹂躏后，大多数利安人拒绝了神灵。这并不是说他们否认神灵的存在；他们只是认为神灵是多变的，最终不值得崇拜。列昂尼德与众神表显示了列昂尼德对众神可能采取的一系列态度。",

Despite their resemblance to those other scaled folk, however, lizardfolk are their own people and have lived on the worlds of the Material Plane since the worlds' creation.

Because of that fact, many lizardfolk myths state that their people were placed by the gods in the Material Plane to guard its natural wonders.": "一些圣人认为萨乌尔蜥蜴人是龙裔和哥布林的远房表亲。尽管他们与其他鳞片人很相似，然而蜥蜴人是他们自己的民族，自从世界被创造以来就一直生活在物质界的各个世界上。蜥蜴人被诸神赋予了非凡的身体防御能力和与自然界的神秘联系，在对其他民族来说是致命的情况下，他们可以仅凭智慧生存。由于这一事实，许多蜥蜴人的神话都说他们的族人被诸神安置在物质世界中，以保护其自然奇迹。",
	"Lizardfolk have colorful scales and exhibit a wide array of scale patterns. Their individual facial features are as varied as those of lizards.": "蜥蜴人有五颜六色的鳞片，表现出各种各样的鳞片图案。他们各自的面部特征和蜥蜴一样丰富多彩。",
	"Only a fool looks at the lizardfolk and sees nothing more than scaly humanoids. Their physical shape notwithstanding, lizardfolk have more in common with iguanas or dragons than they do with humans, dwarves, or elves. Lizardfolk possess an alien and inscrutable mindset, their desires and thoughts driven by a different set of basic principles than those of warm-blooded creatures. Their dismal swamp homes might lie hundreds of miles from the nearest human settlement, but the gap between their way of thinking and that of the smooth-skins is far greater.": "只有傻瓜才会在看蜥蜴人时只看到有鳞的人形动物。尽管他们的身体形状不同，但蜥蜴人与鬣蜥或龙的共同之处多于与人类、矮人或精灵的共同之处。蜥蜴人拥有一种外来的、难以捉摸的心态，他们的欲望和思想受一套不同于温血动物的基本原则所驱动。他们凄凉的沼泽家园可能离最近的人类定居点有几百英里远，但他们的思维方式与光滑皮肤的思维方式之间的差距要大得多。",

Like most reptiles, their feelings largely revolve around fear, aggression, and pleasure.": "蜥蜴人的爬行动物性质不仅体现在他们的外表上，也体现在他们的思维和行为方式上。与其他人类相比，蜥蜴人经历的情感生活更为有限。像大多数爬行动物一样，他们的感情主要围绕着恐惧、攻击和快乐。",
	"Lizardfolk experience most feelings as detached descriptions of creatures and situations. For example, humans confronted by an angry troll experience fear on a basic level. Their limbs shake, their thinking becomes panicked and jumbled, and they react by instinct. The emotion of fear takes hold and controls their actions. In contrast, lizardfolk see emotions as traits assigned to other creatures, objects, and situations. A lizardfolk doesn't think, \"I'm scared.\" Instead, aggressive, stronger creatures register to the lizardfolk as fearsome beings to be avoided if possible. If such creatures attack, lizardfolk flee, fighting only if cornered. Lizardfolk aren't scared of a troll; instead, they understand that a troll is a fearsome, dangerous creature and react accordingly.": "蜥蜴人体验到的大多数感觉是对生物和情况的超然描述。例如，人类在面对愤怒的巨魔时，会在基本层面上体验到恐惧。他们的四肢会颤抖，他们的思维会变得慌乱和混乱，他们的反应是本能的。恐惧的情绪占据并控制着他们的行动。相比之下，蜥蜴人把情绪看作是分配给其他生物、物体和情况的特征。蜥蜴人不会想，\"我很害怕\"。相反，攻击性的、更强大的生物在蜥蜴人看来是可怕的生物，如果可能的话，应该避免。如果这种生物发起攻击，蜥蜴人就会逃跑，只有在被逼到绝境时才会战斗。蜥蜴人并不害怕巨魔；相反，他们明白巨魔是一种可怕的、危险的生物，并作出相应的反应。",
	"Lizardfolk never become angry in the way others do, but they act with aggression toward creatures that they could defeat in a fight and that can't be dealt with in some other manner. They are aggressive toward prey they want to eat, creatures that want to harm them, and so on.": "蜥蜴人从来没有像其他人那样变得愤怒，但他们对那些他们可以在战斗中击败的、无法用其他方式处理的生物采取攻击性行动。他们对他们想吃的猎物、想伤害他们的生物等都有攻击性。",
	"Pleasurable people and things make life easier for lizardfolk. Pleasurable things should be preserved and protected, sometimes at the cost of the lizardfolk's own safety. The most pleasurable creatures and things are ones that allow lizardfolk to assess more situations as benign rather than fearsome.": "愉快的人和事使蜥蜴人的生活更轻松。令人愉快的事物应该被保存和保护，有时甚至以蜥蜴人自己的安全为代价。最令人愉快的生物和事物是那些能让蜥蜴人将更多的情况评估为良性的而不是可怕的。",
	"Most humanoids describe cold-blooded people as lacking in emotion and empathy. The same label serves as an apt depiction of lizardfolk.": "大多数人形生物将冷血的人描述为缺乏情感和同情心。同样的标签也是对蜥蜴人的贴切描述。",
	"Lacking any internal emotional reactions, lizardfolk behave in a distant manner. They don't mourn fallen comrades or rage against their enemies. They simply observe and react as a situation warrants.": "由于缺乏任何内在的情绪反应，蜥蜴人的行为方式很冷漠。他们不哀悼死去的战友，也不怒斥他们的敌人。他们只是观察，并根据情况作出反应。",
	"Lizardfolk lack meaningful emotional ties to the past. They assess situations based on their current and future utility and importance. Nowhere does this come through as strongly as when lizardfolk deal with the dead. To a lizardfolk, a comrade who dies becomes a potential source of food. That companion might have once been a warrior or hunter, but now the body is just freshly killed meat.": "蜥蜴人对过去缺乏有意义的情感纽带。他们根据当前和未来的效用和重要性来评估情况。这一点在蜥蜴人与死者打交道时体现得最为强烈。对蜥蜴人来说，一个死去的同伴会成为潜在的食物来源。这个同伴可能曾经是一个战士或猎人，但现在他的尸体只是新杀的肉。",
	"A lizardfolk who lives among other humanoids can, over time, learn to respect other creatures' emotions. The lizardfolk doesn't share those feelings, but instead assesses them in the same clinical manner. Yes, the fallen dwarf might be most useful as a meal, but hacking the body into steaks provokes aggression in the other humanoids and makes them less helpful in battle.": "生活在其他人类中的蜥蜴人，随着时间的推移，可以学会尊重其他生物的情感。蜥蜴人并不分享这些情感，而是以同样的临床方式评估它们。是的，倒下的矮人可能是最有用的一餐，但把尸体砍成牛排会激起其他人形生物的攻击性，使他们在战斗中的帮助减少。",
	"The lizardfolk mindset might seem unnecessarily cruel, but it helps them survive in a hostile environment. The swamps they inhabit are filled with a staggering variety of threats. Lizardfolk focus on survival above all, without sentiment.": "蜥蜴人的思维方式可能看起来不必要的残忍，但这有助于他们在恶劣的环境中生存。他们居住的沼泽地充满了各种惊人的威胁。蜥蜴人专注于生存至上，没有感情。",
	"Lizardfolk assess everyone and everything in terms of utility. Art and beauty have little meaning for them. A sharp sword serves a useful and good purpose, while a dull sword is a dead weight without a whetstone.": "蜥蜴人从实用性的角度来评估每个人和每件事。艺术和美对他们来说没有什么意义。一把锋利的剑有一个有用的、好的目的，而一把钝的剑没有磨刀石就是一个死物。",
	"Lizardfolk see little need to plan more than a season or so into the future. This approach allows them to maintain their current level of influence in the world, but it limits their growth. Lizardfolk have no interest in developing writing, making long-term plans, or cultivating other methods to progress beyond their simple existence as hunters and gatherers.": "蜥蜴人认为没有必要对未来进行超过一个季度的规划。这种方法使他们能够保持他们在这个世界上的现有影响水平，但它限制了他们的成长。蜥蜴人对发展写作、制定长期计划或培养其他方法来超越他们作为猎人和采集者的简单存在毫无兴趣。",
	"At their core, lizardfolk view other humanoids with an indifference verging on pity. Born into the world lacking stout scales and sharp teeth, it's a wonder they have managed to survive for so long. The typical human would barely make it through a day in the swamps.": "在他们的核心，蜥蜴人以一种近乎怜悯的冷漠来看待其他人类。出生在这个世界上的蜥蜴人缺乏坚固的鳞片和锋利的牙齿，他们能够生存这么久，真是个奇迹。典型的人类在沼泽地里几乎无法度过一天。",
	"Still, if other creatures prove useful to lizardfolk, those creatures can trigger a protective response made all the stronger by their apparent weakness. The lizardfolk assess such beings as hatchlings, young ones incapable of protecting themselves but who might prove useful in the future if they receive care.": "不过，如果其他生物被证明对蜥蜴人有用，这些生物可以触发一种保护性的反应，因为它们明显的弱点而变得更加强大。蜥蜴人将这些生物视为幼崽，这些幼崽没有能力保护自己，但如果他们得到照顾，可能会在未来证明是有用的。",

	"Names confuse them, unless they are descriptive. They tend to apply their own naming conventions to other creatures using Common words.": "名字让他们感到困惑，除非它们是描述性的。他们倾向于将自己的命名规则应用于其他生物，使用普通词汇。",
	"Lizardfolk use active verbs to describe the world. A lizardfolk in cold weather might say, \"This wind brings cold\" rather than \"I feel cold.\" Lizardfolk tend to define things in terms of actions, rather than effects.": "蜥蜴人使用主动动词来描述世界。在寒冷的天气里，蜥蜴人可能会说，\"这风带来了寒冷\"，而不是 \"我感到寒冷\"。蜥蜴人倾向于用行动来定义事物，而不是效果。",
	"Lizardfolk take their names from the Draconic language. They use simple descriptives granted by the tribe based on an individual's notable deeds or actions. For example, Garurt translates as \"axe,\" a name given to a lizardfolk warrior who defeated an orc and claimed his foe's weapon. A lizardfolk who likes to hide in a stand of reeds before ambushing an animal might be called Achuak, which means \"green\" to describe how she blends into the foliage.": "蜥蜴人的名字来自于德拉克斯语。他们使用部落根据个人的显著事迹或行动而授予的简单描述。例如，加鲁特（Garurt）被翻译成 \"斧头\"，这个名字是给一个打败兽人并夺取敌人武器的蜥蜴人战士的。一个喜欢在伏击动物前躲在芦苇丛中的蜥蜴人可能被称为Achuak，意思是 \"绿色\"，以描述她如何融入树叶中。",

	"The humanoid elephants called loxodons are often oases of calm in the busy streets of Ravnica. They hum or chant in sonorous tones and move slowly or sit in perfect stillness. If provoked to action, loxodons are true terrors—bellowing with rage, trumpeting and flapping their ears. Their serene wisdom, fierce loyalty, and unwavering conviction are tremendous assets to their guilds.": "被称为Loxodons的人形大象常常是拉夫尼卡繁忙街道上的平静绿洲。它们用铿锵有力的语调哼唱或吟唱，缓慢地移动或静静地坐着。如果被激怒了，loxodons是真正的恐怖--怒吼着，吹着喇叭，拍着耳朵。他们宁静的智慧、强烈的忠诚和坚定的信念是他们行会的巨大财富。",
	"Loxodons tower above most other humanoids, standing over 7 feet tall. They have the heads—trunks, tusks, ears, and faces—of elephants, and hulking bipedal bodies covered by thick, leathery skin.

	"Like that of an elephant, a loxodon's trunk is a useful appendage. In addition to providing a keen sense of smell, the trunk can be used to lift and carry even heavy objects. The trunk can be used to carry both food and liquid to the mouth and can even act as a snorkel.": "和大象一样，狐狸的躯干是一个有用的附属物。除了提供敏锐的嗅觉外，树干还可以用来举起和搬运甚至是重物。躯干可以用来把食物和液体送到嘴里，甚至可以充当呼吸管。",
	"Loxodons are tireless, patient artisans with an unrivaled intuition about their craft. Although they make nurturing spiritual leaders, their gift for stonework is so ingrained that they are often at a loss when they try to impart that knowledge to others. Among the Selesnya, it primarily falls to loxodons to build the guild's magnificent, cathedral-like arboretum structures.": "Loxodons是不知疲倦、有耐心的工匠，对他们的手艺有着无与伦比的直觉。虽然他们是培育精神的领袖，但他们的石匠天赋是如此根深蒂固，以至于当他们试图向他人传授这种知识时，往往无所适从。在塞勒斯尼亚人中，建造公会宏伟的、像大教堂一样的树木园结构的工作主要落在了loxodons身上。",

	"Loxodons believe that the members of a group have a responsibility to look out for each other. Once they have joined a guild or bonded with other individuals in any capacity, loxodons devote themselves to maintaining that bond.

They expect reciprocal loyalty and commitment from the other members of their communities and can be severe in their disappointment when their trust is betrayed.": "Loxodons认为，一个团体的成员有责任互相照顾。一旦他们加入了一个行会或以任何身份与其他个人结合，loxodons就会致力于维持这种联系。他们协调自己的努力，并经常愿意为了群体的利益而牺牲自己。他们期望从他们社区的其他成员那里得到对等的忠诚和承诺，当他们的信任被背叛时，他们会感到严重的失望。",
	"The primary difference between loxodons who join different guilds is their sense of the size of the community they belong to.

	"Although minotaurs aren't evil by nature and are free to worship any god, many are raised among those devoted to Mogis's vile whims. Myths tell that Mogis created the first minotaurs from his own followers, typically criminals and monsters of unspeakable depravity. While many groups of minotaurs still honor their villainous progenitors, others have abandoned their ancestors and moved beyond their crimes, seeking their fates in the future, not the past.": "虽然牛头人本质上并不邪恶，而且可以自由地崇拜任何神，但许多牛头人是在那些致力于莫吉斯的卑鄙想法的人中长大的。神话中说，莫吉斯从他自己的追随者中创造了第一批牛头人，这些人通常是罪犯和无法形容的堕落的怪物。虽然许多牛头人群体仍然尊重他们邪恶的祖先，但其他人已经抛弃了他们的祖先，超越了他们的罪行，在未来而不是过去寻求他们的命运。",
	"While the inhabitants of Akros and other reaches near Phoberos, the homeland of most minotaur herds, have engaged in endless conflicts with bloodthirsty minotaurs, they know there are those who forsake Mogis's depravities. The people of Meletis, Setessa, and lands beyond are also generally open-minded and curious about minotaurs who wander into their lands. Epics like {@i The} {@i Callapheia} also describe multiple heroic minotaurs.

The moral of this story is simply that Mogis is a god who rewards his faithful servants.": "一些传说声称莫吉斯创造了牛头人，改造了他最嗜血的追随者，使他们巨大的身体与他自己的身体相像。然而，虽然在斯科福斯的迷宫城市中讲述的故事肯定了莫吉斯奖励了他最忠实的追随者，但他们断言这些追随者本来就是牛头人，而莫吉斯所做的只是将他们提升到一个尊贵的地位。在崇拜Mogis的牛头人中，这些英雄被尊为精神上的祖先，即使不是字面上的。这个故事的寓意很简单，莫吉斯是一个奖励其忠实仆人的神。",
	"Minotaurs who don't follow Mogis are quick to point out that this myth says nothing about the nature of minotaurs. The worship of Mogis, they argue, is no more inherent to them than it is to humans, and minotaurs aren't destined to a life of slaughter because of the circumstances of their creation. Perhaps most importantly, minotaurs aren't an offshoot of humanity but a people in their own right, and neither their nature nor their destiny is tied to a single god.": "不追随Mogis的牛头人很快就指出，这个神话没有说明牛头人的本质。他们认为，对Mogis的崇拜并不像对人类那样是与生俱来的，而且牛头人并不因为他们被创造的环境而注定要过着被屠杀的生活。也许最重要的是，牛头人不是人类的分支，而是有自己权利的民族，他们的本性和命运都不与一个神联系在一起。",

	"Even those minotaurs who feel personal affinity for the horned God-Pharaoh align themselves most closely with Bontu and Hazoret in practice. Driven by a fierce and powerful desire to prove themselves, to earn glory in life, and to win a glorious death, they view every challenge or obstacle as a chance to demonstrate their prowess. With ruthless abandon, they slash, batter, and pummel their way through anyone or anything that stands in the way of their own advancement. With reckless fervor, they fight without heed for their own safety, shrugging off the blows of their enemies.": "即使是那些对有角的神--法老感到个人亲和力的牛头人，在实践中也与邦图和哈佐雷特最为接近。在激烈而强大的欲望的驱使下，他们想证明自己，想在生活中赢得荣耀，想赢得光荣的死亡，他们把每一个挑战或障碍都视为展示自己能力的机会。他们带着无情的放弃，以砍伐、殴打和重击的方式穿过任何阻碍他们前进的人或物。他们带着鲁莽的狂热，不顾自己的安全而战斗，甩掉敌人的打击。",
	"Their size and strength makes minotaurs ideally suited for hand-to-hand combat. They are most effective on the offensive, delivering an endless barrage of attacks that keep their foes off balance, shatter shields and weapons, and inevitably break their opponents. These minotaurs favor large, heavy weapons such as axes, {@item maul|phb|mauls}, and two-handed khopeshes (treat as a {@item greatsword|phb}), but they are also fond of unarmed combat. Many love to throw their weapons aside in favor of pummeling opponents into submission with their horns and bare hands, believing that such a victory is more glorious—and more humiliating to the loser.": "他们的体型和力量使牛头人非常适合于徒手搏斗。他们在进攻中最为有效，提供无尽的攻击，使他们的敌人失去平衡，粉碎盾牌和武器，并不可避免地打破他们的对手。这些牛头人喜欢大型重型武器，如斧头、{@item maul|phb|mauls}和双手剑(视作{@item greatsword|phb})，但他们也喜欢徒手搏斗。许多人喜欢把武器扔在一边，而用他们的角和赤手空拳把对手打得服服帖帖，他们认为这样的胜利更光荣--而且对失败者来说也更丢脸。",
	"But though minotaurs are known for their physical size and strength, this hardly precludes the presence of keen minds and powerful spellcasters among them. Though they are fewer in number than hand-to-hand specialists, minotaur mages draw on their natural ferocity to instill terror in the hearts of their opponents with a terrible roaring bellow. They manifest their fury as blasts of flame, or imbue their own horns and fists with searing heat to make their physical attacks more deadly.": "尽管牛头人以其体型和力量著称，但这并不妨碍他们中存在敏锐的头脑和强大的法术师。尽管牛头人法师的数量比徒手搏斗的专家少，但他们利用自己天生的凶猛，以可怕的咆哮声在对手心中灌输恐怖。他们将自己的愤怒表现为火焰喷射，或将自己的角和拳头注入灼热的温度，使他们的物理攻击更加致命。",
	"The relatively few minotaurs who specialize in long-range combat enjoy one aspect of that style in particular—the opportunity to draw first blood, marking the moment when a battle has truly begun. Minotaurs use {@item longbow|phb|heavy bows} and {@item javelin|phb|javelins}, and take special delight in firing into the middle of enemy formations to sow as much chaos and confusion as possible.": "专注于远程战斗的牛头人相对较少，他们特别喜欢这种风格的一个方面--有机会流第一滴血，标志着一场战斗真正开始的时刻。牛头人使用{@item longbow|phb|heavy bows}和{@item javelin|phb|javelins}，并且特别喜欢向敌人的阵地中间开火，以尽可能地制造混乱。",
	"Naga resemble enormous snakes with shoulders, arms, and a torso that resembles a humanoid form. They typically hold their heads and torsos off the ground while moving, but they can increase their speed by lowering their bodies and using their hands for extra propulsion. They adorn their torsos with armor, jewelry, and a vague nod toward the clothing worn by other races. Male naga have broad hoods, wider than their shoulders, while females have narrower hoods and longer faces.": "娜迦类似于巨大的蛇，有肩膀、手臂和类似人形的躯干。他们在移动时通常将头和躯干离地，但他们可以通过降低身体和使用双手来增加速度。他们用盔甲、珠宝和其他种族穿的衣服来装饰自己的躯干，并含糊地点头。雄性娜迦有宽大的头罩，比他们的肩膀还宽，而雌性娜迦的头罩较窄，脸较长。",
	"Naga believe in a principle called the Sweetest Harmony, which describes a perfect balance between the body and the mind. Finding that balance, as they understand it, is a sure path to glory in the trials, since a combination of physical and mental preparation will ensure success in every trial. For an example of this Sweetest Harmony, they point to the Luxa river and the land it nourishes, which exist in a delicate and life-giving balance. Either one without the other would be diminished and useless. Just so, mental strength supports physical capabilities, and physical fortitude feeds mental tenacity, so neither mind nor body can exist in isolation.": "娜迦相信一个叫做 \"最甜蜜的和谐 \"的原则，它描述了身体和心灵之间的完美平衡。按照他们的理解，找到这种平衡是在试验中获得荣耀的必经之路，因为身体和心理准备的结合将确保在每一次试验中取得成功。对于这种最甜蜜的和谐的例子，他们指出卢克萨河和它所滋养的土地，它们存在于一种微妙的、赋予生命的平衡中。任何一方离开了另一方，都会变得渺小和无用。就像这样，精神力量支持身体能力，身体的坚韧支持精神的坚韧，所以身心都不能孤立地存在。",
	"In the same way, the naga believe that Kefnet and Rhonas exist in interdependence, and that their trials are best conceived as two halves of a whole. But in practice, as much as they strive for balance and harmony, most naga identify more strongly with one god than the other.": "同样，纳迦人相信凯夫奈特和罗纳斯是相互依存的，他们的考验最好被视为一个整体的两个部分。但实际上，尽管他们努力追求平衡与和谐，大多数纳迦人对一个神的认同比另一个神更强烈。",
	"To the benefit of those naga who struggle with the ideal of the Sweetest Harmony, the training of acolytes encourages specialization. Thus, naga who follow in the path of the snake-headed god Rhonas can cultivate their physical strength as they specialize in hand-to-hand combat styles, while other naga favor the teachings of Kefnet and other combat styles.": "为了让那些为 \"最甜蜜的和谐 \"理想而奋斗的纳迦人受益，对信徒的训练鼓励专业化。因此，追随蛇头神罗纳斯的娜迦可以培养他们的体力，因为他们擅长徒手搏斗的风格，而其他娜迦则喜欢凯夫奈特的教义和其他战斗风格。",
	"Naga who specialize in hand-to-hand combat rely on axes, {@item dagger|phb|daggers}, and {@item shortsword|phb|shortswords}—but also on their own fangs and the constricting strength of their serpentine bodies. They make extensive use of poison, coating their weapons with multiple layers of deadly substances—including, but by no means limited to, their own venom. Quick, well-timed, and well-placed blows, followed by an equally nimble retreat, allow many naga to triumph over opponents who might seem stronger. With acknowledgment of the Sweetest Harmony, these naga cultivate an understanding of strategy and tactics that enhances their physical training.": "专注于徒手搏斗的纳迦人依靠斧头、{@item dagger|phb|daggers}和{@item shortsword|phb|shortswords}，但也依靠他们自己的獠牙和他们蛇形身体的收缩力。他们广泛使用毒药，在武器上涂上多层致命的物质--包括但不限于他们自己的毒液。迅速、适时、到位的打击，再加上同样灵活的撤退，使许多娜迦能够战胜那些看起来更强大的对手。随着对 \"最甜蜜的和谐 \"的认可，这些娜迦培养了对战略和战术的理解，加强了他们的身体训练。",
	"Speed and accuracy are equally important to naga who specialize in long-range combat. Some prefer to analyze a battle from a distance and pick off the strongest opponents with their ranged weapons, including poisoned {@item spear|phb|spears} and {@item arrow|phb|arrows}. Others ride in {@item chariot|phb|chariots} driven by trusted drivers (usually other naga) and throw their {@item spear|phb|spears} from the midst of battle. In any case, they excel at finding and exploiting strategic advantages.": "对于擅长远程作战的娜迦来说，速度和准确性同样重要。有些人喜欢从远处分析战斗，用他们的远程武器，包括有毒的（%0%）和（%1%），挑掉最强的对手。其他人则乘坐由值得信赖的司机（通常是其他娜迦）驾驶的（%2%），在战斗中投掷他们的（%3%）。在任何情况下，他们都擅长于寻找和利用战略优势。",
	"Some naga mages, drawn to the example of Kefnet, make extensive use of illusion magic to trick and mislead their opponents. Others apply Rhonas's teachings to their studies, wielding poisonous magic that weakens opponents or kills them outright with clouds or darts of deadly toxins. Still others, in service to the ideal of balance, use the magical power of their minds to enhance their physical strength and speed.": "一些娜迦法师，被凯夫奈特的例子所吸引，大量使用幻术来欺骗和误导他们的对手。其他人则将罗纳斯的教诲运用到他们的研究中，挥舞着有毒的魔法，削弱对手或用致命毒素的云或飞镖直接杀死他们。还有一些人，为了实现平衡的理想，利用他们心灵的魔力来增强他们的身体力量和速度。",
	"Orcs trace their creation to the one-eyed god Gruumsh, an unstoppable warrior and powerful leader. The divine qualities of Gruumsh resonate within orcs, granting them a reflection of his toughness and tenacity that can't be matched, and the god equipped his children to be able to live above or below ground.": "兽人的创造可以追溯到独眼神格鲁姆什，一个不可阻挡的战士和强大的领袖。格鲁姆什的神性在兽人体内产生了共鸣，赋予了他们无法比拟的坚韧和顽强的反映，神为他的孩子们配备了能够在地面或地下生活的能力。",
	"On some worlds, such as Eberron, orcs were among the first defenders of the natural order from the encroachments of Fiends and other extraplanar threats. Gruumsh's blessings have made orcs tireless guardians and mighty allies wherever they are found, even when they turn their devotion to other gods.": "在一些世界上，比如埃伯龙，兽人是自然秩序的第一批捍卫者，他们不受恶魔和其他星外威胁的侵扰。格鲁姆什的祝福使兽人成为不知疲倦的守护者和强大的盟友，无论他们在哪里都能找到，即使他们把自己的信仰转向其他神。",

	"Plasmoids are amorphous beings with no typical shape. In the presence of other folk, they often adopt a similar form, but there's little chance of mistaking a plasmoid for anything else. They consume food by osmosis, the way an amoeba does, and excrete waste through tiny pores. They breathe by absorbing oxygen through another set of pores, and their limbs are strong and flexible enough to grasp and manipulate weapons and tools. Although most plasmoids are translucent gray, they can alter their color and translucence by absorbing dyes through their pores.": "塑形体是无定形的生命，没有典型的形状。在其他生物面前，它们经常采取类似的形式，但几乎没有机会把一个塑形体误认为其他东西。它们通过渗透作用摄取食物，就像变形虫那样，并通过微小的孔隙排泄废物。它们通过另一组气孔吸收氧气来呼吸，它们的四肢强壮而灵活，足以抓取和操纵武器和工具。虽然大多数塑形虫是半透明的灰色，但它们可以通过毛孔吸收染料来改变其颜色和半透明性。",
	"Plasmoids don't have internal organs of the usual sort. Their bodies are composed of cells, fibers, plasma-like ooze, and clusters of nerves called ganglia. These nerves enable a plasmoid to detect light, heat, texture, sound, pain, and vibrations. Plasmoids can stiffen the outer layers of their bodies to maintain a humanlike shape, so they can wear clothing and accessories. They speak by forcing air out of tubular cavities that constrict to produce sound.": "Plasmoids没有通常意义上的内部器官。它们的身体由细胞、纤维、血浆状渗出物和称为神经节的神经簇组成。这些神经使塑形体能够探测到光、热、质地、声音、疼痛和振动。塑形体可以使它们身体的外层变硬，以保持类似人类的形状，因此它们可以穿戴衣服和饰品。它们通过迫使空气从管状腔体中流出而说话，管状腔体收缩产生声音。",

It's the delight in small things: the song of a bird, a warm breeze, the smell of a tasty pie, relaxing by a river in the sunshine. Life freely offers these gifts, and for a satyr, they are more valuable than gold or glory. To revel means to forget the constraints of time, to let go of the future and past, and to be wholly in the present moment.

Most just see the beast within as a formidable expression of their inner nature, something that emerges as the shifter's personality takes shape. The beast within is a pool of powerful instincts, and its influence is revealed by a shifter's personality: a feline shifter may be cool and distant, driven by predatory instincts, while a shifter with a lupine spirit might be drawn to find and protect a pack. When a shifter fully embraces this beast within they physically transform for a short time.": "在童年早期，变身者与内心的野兽形成了一种联系，一种塑造他们身体和心灵的图腾力量。一些移居者相信这些精神是独立的实体，他们可能会把熊或狼说成是祖先或向导。大多数人只是把内心的野兽看作是他们内在本性的一种强大的表达，是随着变身者的个性形成而出现的东西。内心的野兽是一种强大的本能，它的影响由移居者的个性所揭示：一个猫科移居者可能是冷酷和遥远的，由捕食本能驱动，而一个具有羽扇豆精神的移居者可能被吸引去寻找和保护一个群体。当一个变身者完全拥抱内心的野兽时，他们会在短时间内发生身体上的变化。",

They have thick tails, four to five feet long, which lash or coil around their legs when they get upset or nervous. Their canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are solid colors black, red, white, silver, or gold with no visible sclera or pupil.

The reality, though, is that a tiefling's bloodline doesn't affect his or her personality to any great degree. Years of dealing with mistrust does leave its mark on most tieflings, and they respond to it in different ways. Some choose to live up to the wicked stereotype, but others are virtuous. Most are simply very aware of how people respond to them. After dealing with this mistrust throughout youth, a tiefling often develops the ability to overcome prejudice through charm or intimidation.": "人们倾向于怀疑盗贼，认为他们的地狱遗产已经在他们的个性和道德上留下了印记，而不仅仅是他们的外表。当盗贼进入他们的商店时，店主会密切注意他们的货物，镇上的守卫可能会跟踪盗贼一段时间，而煽动者会把奇怪的事情归咎于盗贼。但现实是，一个盗贼的血统并不会在很大程度上影响他或她的个性。多年来与不信任打交道的经历确实在大多数盗贼身上留下了印记，他们以不同的方式回应它。有些人选择活在邪恶的刻板印象中，但有些人则是贤惠的。大多数人只是非常清楚人们对他们的反应。在整个青年时期与这种不信任打交道后，一个盗贼往往会发展出通过魅力或恐吓来克服偏见的能力。",

It leaves the place of its birth and finds its own corner of the wilderness in which to hunt, catch fish, and get by. With each passing year, a tortle hones its survival skills.

It's not unusual for a tortle to hear stories or legends related to a god and choose to worship that deity. In the Forgotten Realms, tortles are especially fond of Eldath, Gond, Lathander, Savras, Selûne, and Tymora. In the Greyhawk setting, they gravitate toward Celestian, Fharlanghn, Pelor, Pholtus, and St. Cuthbert. Tortles are often drawn to the Gods of Good in Dragonlance and the Sovereign Host in Eberron.

	"Tortles have a saying: \"We wear our homes on our backs.\" The shells they carry around provide all the shelter they require. Consequently, tortles don't feel the need to root themselves in one place for too long. A tortle settlement is primarily used as a kind of moot, where tortles can socialize with one another, share useful information, and trade with strangers in the safety of greater numbers. Tortles don't regard these settlements as places worth defending with their lives, and they will abandon a settlement when it no longer serves their needs.": "Tortles有一句话。\"我们的家在我们的背上\"。它们随身携带的贝壳提供了它们所需的所有住所。因此，托尔人觉得没有必要在一个地方扎根太久。托特尔人的定居点主要是作为一种模拟场所，在那里，托特尔人可以相互交往，分享有用的信息，并在人数较多的情况下与陌生人进行交易。托尔人不认为这些定居点是值得用生命去捍卫的地方，当一个定居点不再满足他们的需要时，他们会放弃这个定居点。",

The urge to procreate doesn't kick in until the end of a tortle's life, and a tortle can spend decades away from its native land without feeling homesick.": "大多数龟类喜欢看其他生物如何生活，发现新的习俗和新的做事方式。生育的冲动直到跗骨之蛆生命的最后一刻才开始，而且跗骨之蛆可以在远离故土的地方度过几十年而不感到想家。",
	"Tortles embrace a simple view of the world. It is a place of wonder, and tortles see beauty in the ordinary.

	"Although they spend a considerable portion of their lives in isolation, tortles are social creatures that like to form meaningful friendships.

Their digits are webbed, allowing them to swim as quickly as they can run.": "海龙是一种两栖动物，在水中安家，但在干燥的陆地上也能活动。它们的身体覆盖着细密的鳞片，从黄绿色到蓝色到深紫色不等。他们的头部有突出的峰顶，鳍从他们的前臂、小腿和肩膀上长出。它们的手指有蹼，使它们能够像跑步一样快速游泳。",

They fashion most of their clothes and other items from materials found in the ocean: coral, seaweed, shells, bone, sea urchin spines, the shells of monstrous crustaceans, and so on.

All that Dalakos knew was destroyed, obliterated by the might of the kraken.": "达拉克斯认为自己是一个和其他任何人一样的三体人--好奇心强、思维敏捷，甚至可能被众神赋予了非凡的聪明才智。但他不专心，容易分心，他的潜力就像石头上的种子一样散落一地。直到一只克拉肯从海洋深处升起，开始横行霸道，威胁到达拉克斯的社区，他才被迫专注起来。随着怪兽的逼近，达拉克斯想方设法让怪兽离开它的道路。他没日没夜地工作，但最终他的计划失败了。达拉克斯所知道的一切都被摧毁了，被克拉肯的力量所湮没。",
	"Yet the kraken carried on, moving toward a coastal human settlement. Amid the ruins of his home, Dalakos had a revelation.

Today, Dalakos resides inside the kraken's shell, where he works day and night, his heart broken, but his mind forever focused on bringing his gifts to life.": "然而，克拉肯继续前进，向沿海的人类定居点移动。在他家的废墟中，达拉克斯得到了一个启示。他拼命工作，制作了一个神奇的装置，这个装置最终使克拉肯倒下，拯救了小镇。今天，达拉克斯住在克拉肯的壳里，他在那里日夜工作，他的心碎了，但他的心永远专注于把他的礼物带入生活。",
	"A triton's name is a symbol of choice. Upon reaching adulthood, a triton might shed the name they were given by their parents for one of their own choosing. Some opt to keep their name, but the majority select one that represents the adult they've become. Tritons might even go on to choose yet other names, as they shift from one phase of life to another, or after significant life events. Leaving a home community or transitioning to live among dryfolk might constitute such life changes. Tritons also have a fluid concept of gender and might switch names freely as they shift gender identities.": "特里顿的名字是一种选择的象征。成年后，三体人可能会舍弃父母给他们的名字而选择自己的名字。有些人选择保留他们的名字，但大多数人选择一个代表他们已经成为成年人的名字。三体人甚至可能继续选择其他的名字，因为他们从生命的一个阶段转移到另一个阶段，或者在重大的生活事件之后。离开家乡的社区或过渡到生活在干尸中可能构成这样的生活变化。天龙人对性别的概念也是不固定的，当他们改变性别身份时，可能会自由转换名字。",

Long-established guardians of the deep ocean floor, in recent years the noble tritons have become increasingly active in the world above.": "三角龙守护着海洋深处，在深海沟、通往元素世界的门户以及其他远离陆地的危险地点建立小型定居点。深海海底的守护者由来已久，近年来，高贵的三爪鱼在上面的世界变得越来越活跃。",
	"Centuries ago, tritons entered the world in response to the growing threat of evil elementals. Tritons waged many wars against their enemies on the Plane of Water, driving them into the Darkened Depths where they escaped into the crushing pressure and utter darkness. In time, the tritons noticed that their ancient elemental foes had grown quiet. Expeditions to the depths revealed that krakens, sahuagin, and far worse foes had fled the Plane of Water for the Material Plane.": "几个世纪前，为了应对日益增长的邪恶元素的威胁，三头龙进入了这个世界。三体人对他们在水界的敌人发动了许多战争，把他们赶到黑暗的深渊，在那里他们逃到了破碎的压力和彻底的黑暗中。随着时间的推移，三体人注意到他们古老的元素敌人已经变得安静了。对深渊的考察显示，克拉肯人、萨瓦金人和更可怕的敌人已经逃离水界，前往物质界。",

A great conclave of tritons chose volunteers skilled in weapons and magic as part of an expeditionary force to enter the Material Plane and seek out their enemies.": "三体人在义务和责任感的驱使下，不会让他们的敌人如此轻易地逃脱。一个伟大的三体人会议选择了精通武器和魔法的志愿者作为远征军的一部分，进入物质世界，寻找他们的敌人。",

They defeated their foes when they found them and drove the rest into hiding.": "这些三体人遍布世界各大洋，并建立了保护国，监视深海海沟、门户、海底洞穴和其他可能潜伏着敌人的地方。他们在发现敌人时将其击败，并将其余的敌人赶到藏身之处。",
	"With their foes banished to the deepest reaches of the sea, tritons settled in to watch for any sign of their return. Over time, the tritons extended their stewardship over the sea floor from their initial settlements and built outposts to create trade with other races. Despite this expansion, few folk know of them. Their settlements are so remote even merfolk and sea elves rarely encounter them.": "随着他们的敌人被放逐到海洋的最深处，三体人定居下来，观察他们回来的任何迹象。随着时间的推移，三龙人将他们的管理权从最初的定居点扩展到了海底，并建立了前哨站，与其他种族进行贸易。尽管这种扩张，很少有人知道他们。他们的定居点是如此遥远，甚至连人鱼族和海精灵都很少遇到他们。",
	"As a result of their isolation and limited understanding of the Material Plane, tritons can come across as haughty and arrogant. They see themselves as caretakers of the sea, and they expect other creatures to pay them deep respect, if not complete deference.": "由于他们与世隔绝，对物质世界的了解有限，三龙人可能会表现得傲慢无礼。他们认为自己是海洋的守护者，他们希望其他生物对他们表示深深的敬意，如果不是完全服从的话。",
	"This attitude might grate on others, but it arises from a seed of truth. Few know of the tritons' great victories over dreadful undersea threats. The tritons make little allowance for such ignorance and are delighted to expound upon the great debt others owe them.": "这种态度可能会让其他人感到不快，但它是由一个真理的种子产生的。很少有人知道三体人对可怕的海底威胁所取得的伟大胜利。三角洲人对这种无知不屑一顾，并乐于阐释别人欠他们的巨大债务。",
	"Tritons also have a tendency to emerge from their isolation under the assumption that other folk will welcome them as respected allies and mentors. Again, distance drives much of this attitude. The tritons' limited view of the world leaves them ignorant of the kingdoms, wars, and other struggles of the surface world. Tritons readily see such concerns as minor events, a sideshow to the tritons' role as the world's true protectors.": "天龙人也有一种倾向，即在假设其他民族会欢迎他们成为受人尊敬的盟友和导师的情况下，从他们的孤立状态中走出来。同样，距离是这种态度的主要驱动力。三角洲人对世界的有限看法使他们对表面世界的王国、战争和其他斗争一无所知。三体人很容易把这些问题看作是小事，是三体人作为世界真正保护者的角色的副产品。",
	"Despite their off-putting manners, tritons are benevolent creatures at heart, convinced that other civilized races deserve their protection. Their attitude might grate, but when pirate fleets prowl the waves or a kraken awakens from its slumber, they are among the first to take up arms to protect others.": "尽管三体人的举止令人不快，但他们内心是善良的生物，确信其他文明种族值得他们保护。他们的态度可能令人不快，但当海盗船队在海面上游荡或海怪从沉睡中苏醒时，他们是第一个拿起武器保护他人的人。",
	"Tritons readily sacrifice themselves for the common good. They will fight and die for humans, merfolk, and other creatures without question. Their self-absorbed nature makes them overlook the history of other creatures, but they also endure a sense of guilt over allowing the evils of the Plane of Water to enter the Material Plane and threaten its inhabitants. The tritons believe they owe a debt of honor to the world, and they will fight and die to pay it.": "天龙人很乐意为公共利益而牺牲自己。他们会毫不犹豫地为人类、人鱼族和其他生物而战斗和牺牲。他们自我陶醉的天性使他们忽视了其他生物的历史，但他们也忍受着一种内疚感，因为他们允许水界的邪恶进入物质界并威胁到其居民。三体人相信他们对这个世界欠下了一笔荣誉债，他们将为偿还这笔债而战斗和牺牲。",
	"At times their fervor and ignorance of the world can lead them astray. Tritons encountering other creatures for the first time can underestimate them, leaving the tritons vulnerable to deception. With their strong martial tradition, tritons can sometimes be too eager to leap into a fight.": "有时，他们的狂热和对世界的无知会使他们误入歧途。第一次遇到其他生物的特里顿人可能会低估它们，使特里顿人容易被欺骗。由于他们有很强的武术传统，特里顿人有时会过于急切地跃入战斗。",
	"Given their isolation, most tritons have never been to the surface world. They struggle with the idea that they can't easily move up and down out of water, and the changing of the seasons mystifies them.": "鉴于他们与世隔绝，大多数三文鱼从未到过地表世界。他们对自己不能轻易离开水面上下移动的想法感到挣扎，而季节的变化也让他们感到神秘。",
	"Tritons also find the variety of social institutions, kingdoms, and other customs bewildering. For all their proud culture, they remain innocent of the surface world.

	"Born into ancient servitude and bred to a life of decadent corruption, the vampires of Zendikar feed on the energy in the blood of living creatures—an energy that is particularly strong in times of terror and pain. To members of the other races, vampires are a fearsome mystery and the stuff of nightmares, hunting their prey like beasts or reclining on thrones made of skulls in their moss-draped cities. But few understand how the vampires are locked in a brutal civil war. On one side are those who hold to their traditional ways, desperately battling to remain free. On the other side are those vampires whose legacy reaches back into the deepest recesses of history. Bound once more to the Eldrazi who were their ancient masters, those vampires hunt their kin in an effort to extinguish any dreams of freedom and rebellion.": "生于古代的奴役，并被培育成一种堕落的生活，赞迪卡的吸血鬼以生物血液中的能量为食--这种能量在恐怖和痛苦的时候特别强大。对于其他种族的成员来说，吸血鬼是一个可怕的谜团，是噩梦的源头，他们像野兽一样猎杀猎物，或者在他们长满青苔的城市中躺在由头骨制成的宝座上。但很少有人了解吸血鬼是如何被锁定在一场残酷的内战中的。一边是那些坚持其传统方式的人，拼命地争取保持自由。另一方则是那些其遗产可以追溯到历史最深处的吸血鬼。这些吸血鬼再次被他们古老的主人埃尔德拉兹（Eldrazi）所束缚，他们猎杀自己的亲属，试图扑灭任何自由和反叛的梦想。",
	"Vampires are associated with black mana. Their existence is predicated on draining the life from others to fuel their own existence, and on putting their own lives ahead of all other concerns. Philosophically, they do not constrain themselves with artificial rules of morality, but believe that the strong can and should take what they need from the weak.": "吸血鬼与黑法力有关。他们的存在是以吸干别人的生命来助长自己的存在为前提的，并且把自己的生命放在所有其他问题之上。在哲学上，他们不会用人为的道德规则来约束自己，而是相信强者可以而且应该从弱者身上获取他们需要的东西。",
	"The vampires of Zendikar are not undead. Rather, their unique nature comes from an eldritch disease that turns their flesh cold, makes their gray or purple skin feel dead to the touch, and enables them to drain concentrated magical energy from the blood of other living creatures. They are tall and slender, with long, elegant necks and broad shoulders. Bony horns protrude from their shoulders and elbows, often augmented by the layered plates of their armor and clothing. Their canine teeth are slightly elongated, but not enough to protrude between their closed lips.": "赞迪卡的吸血鬼并不是不死之身。相反，他们的独特性质来自于一种古老的疾病，这种疾病使他们的肉体变得冰冷，使他们的灰色或紫色的皮肤触摸起来有一种死亡的感觉，并使他们能够从其他生物的血液中吸取集中的魔法能量。他们高大而纤细，有长而优雅的脖子和宽阔的肩膀。骨质的角从他们的肩膀和肘部伸出来，常常被他们的盔甲和衣服的分层板所加强。他们的犬齿略微拉长，但还不足以突出他们紧闭的嘴唇之间。",
	"Vampires dress in leather and the chitin carapaces of the gigantic insects that dwell in the swamps and jungles of their native Guul Draz, augmented with fine silk and gauzy fabric.

It is not unusual to see individual verdan or whole families trooping along the roads of the world with their tents and belongings strapped to their backs.": "由于没有自己的文化身份或记忆，verdan人很快就采用了他们所移居地区的文化习俗。然而，即使是那些被欢迎进入其他文化的verdan人，也会有一种没有真正归属感的感觉。他们常常被流浪的欲望所困扰，保持他们的财产有限，而且容易携带。经常可以看到个别维丹人或整个家庭背着帐篷和物品在世界的道路上奔跑。",
	"Even when they are happily steeped in a culture, the verdan remain on the lookout for oppression and curtailment of freedoms. They understand the need for laws that protect, but they rail against laws that restrict and oppress—especially those designed to protect the power and wealth of the elite. When living among enlightened folk, verdan are still the first to speak out against cultural restraints on individuals, particularly those based on physical characteristics such as gender, race, or appearance.": "即使他们愉快地沉浸在一种文化中，verdan人仍然对压迫和削减自由保持警觉。他们理解保护法律的必要性，但他们反对限制和压迫的法律，特别是那些旨在保护精英阶层的权力和财富的法律。当生活在开明的民间时，verdan仍然是第一个反对对个人进行文化限制的人，特别是那些基于性别、种族或外表等身体特征的限制。",
	"Verdan are hungry to undertake new challenges and absorb new experiences. When they meet other verdan who have traveled to different parts of the world, they drop everything to spend as long as possible sharing stories and observations from their respective travels. However, their inexperience in the world and their racial amnesia sometimes lends the verdan a kind of innocence that works against them. Some are credulous and easily fooled by hucksters, but most verdan have an intuition bred by empathy that helps them eventually sort out those who are sincere from those who are not.": "Verdan渴望接受新的挑战，吸收新的经验。当他们遇到其他去过世界不同地方的维尔丹人时，他们会放下一切，尽可能长时间地分享他们各自旅行中的故事和观察。然而，他们对世界的经验不足和种族失忆，有时会使verdan人有一种对他们不利的纯真。有些人很轻信，很容易被骗子愚弄，但大多数verdan人有一种由同情心培养出来的直觉，帮助他们最终将那些真诚的人和那些不真诚的人区分开来。",
	"The oldest verdan names spring from goblinoid traditions, but more recent names reflect the character of the different cultures these folk have encountered since coming out into the sunlight. When a group of verdan live near dwarves, they might take on more dwarven-sounding names, only to change those names when they wander into a human area. A verdan is also not hesitant to change their name as their physical appearance changes—or, indeed, whenever the mood strikes them.": "最古老的verdan名字来自于地精的传统，但最近的名字反映了这些人在来到阳光下后遇到的不同文化的特征。当一群维丹人住在矮人附近时，他们可能会采用更多听起来像矮人的名字，只是当他们游荡到人类地区时才会改变这些名字。维尔丹人也会毫不犹豫地随着他们身体外表的改变而改变他们的名字，或者，事实上，只要他们有心情，就会改变他们的名字。",
	"Verdan make no differentiation between male, female, and family names, and often eschew family names altogether.": "维尔丹人对男性、女性和家族的名字不加区分，而且常常完全摒弃家族的名字。",

	"When a verdan character gains an ability score improvement at certain levels, that increase can be tied to a physical mutation at the player's determination. A boost to Strength might be accompanied by a growth spurt and the development of rippling muscle, while an increase in Intelligence might produce a stylishly large forehead.": "当verdan角色在某些级别获得能力得分的提高时，这种提高可以与玩家决定的身体变异联系在一起。力量的提高可能伴随着生长的突增和肌肉的发展，而智力的提高可能产生一个时尚的大额头。",
	"Many reptiles derive their body warmth and energy from the sun, but the humanoid viashino are fueled by an inner fire of zeal. Open with their emotions, viashino can be hot-tempered, but they are also quick to their hissing laughter. And they easily form close bonds of friendship. They are fierce warriors and passionate advocates for their guilds and causes.": "许多爬行动物从太阳中获得身体的温暖和能量，但人形的维希诺人却被一种内在的热情之火所推动。维希诺人对自己的情感是开放的，他们可能会脾气暴躁，但他们也会迅速发出嘶嘶的笑声。他们很容易形成亲密的友谊纽带。他们是凶猛的战士，也是他们公会和事业的热情倡导者。",
	"Viashino resemble humanoid lizards covered in green, scaled skin and spiky protrusions. Their heads jut forward from their slender necks and bear huge mouths full of sharp teeth. Long, whiplike tails extend from their spines, lashing behind them—faster and faster as they grow more agitated. Their tails are tipped with bony blades they can use as weapons.": "Viashino类似于人形蜥蜴，覆盖着绿色的、有鳞的皮肤和尖锐的突起。它们的头从细长的脖子上向前突出，长着巨大的嘴巴，上面长满了锋利的牙齿。长长的、像鞭子一样的尾巴从它们的脊柱上伸出来，在它们身后甩动--随着它们越来越激动，速度越来越快。它们的尾巴上有骨质的刀片，可以作为武器使用。",
	"Viashino are fiercely emotional and often violent, and their wizards and sorcerers favor fire spells that reflect their inner fire. They are most common among the Gruul Clans, especially the Slizt clan. Occasionally they put their zealous fire to use in the service of higher ideals, joining the Boros Legion. Other viashino instead pursue careers in the Izzet League, where they find a special role wielding Izzet-designed flamespewing scorchbringers.": "维阿希诺人情绪激烈，经常有暴力倾向，他们的巫师和法师喜欢用火系法术来反映他们内心的火。他们在格鲁尔部族中最常见，尤其是斯里兹特部族。偶尔他们也会将自己热忱的火焰用于为更高的理想服务，加入波罗斯军团。其他viashino则在伊泽特联盟中追求事业，在那里他们找到了一个特殊的角色，挥舞着伊泽特设计的喷火炙烤器。",
	"Like fire itself, viashino are quick to leap from one situation to another, and they are frequently destructive in the process. They enjoy brawling and often cause more injury than intended, thanks to their teeth and bladed tails. They're also easily distracted, jumping from one idea to another in an instant. Likewise, they're easily bored, and if nothing captures their attention, they'll do something interesting.": "就像火本身一样，viashino能迅速从一种情况跳到另一种情况，而且它们在这个过程中经常是破坏性的。它们喜欢争吵，由于它们的牙齿和带刃的尾巴，常常造成比预期更多的伤害。它们也很容易分心，在瞬间从一个想法跳到另一个想法。同样，它们也很容易感到无聊，如果没有什么能吸引它们的注意力，它们会做一些有趣的事情。",
	"Viashino accept, collect, and discard names freely, choosing names that fit their current sense of self or whim. Sometimes they'll string two or more names together, because they like the sound or because all the names feel meaningful and relevant at the time. As a result, members of other races often have a hard time keeping track of a viashino's name.": "维希诺人自由地接受、收集和丢弃名字，选择符合他们当前自我感觉或心血来潮的名字。有时他们会把两个或更多的名字串在一起，因为他们喜欢这个声音，或者因为所有的名字在当时都感觉很有意义和相关。因此，其他种族的成员往往很难记住一个viashino的名字。",

An unexpected breakthrough produced sapient soldiers, giving rise to what some have only grudgingly accepted as a new species. Warforged are made from wood and metal, but they can feel pain and emotion. Built as weapons, they must now find a purpose beyond war. A warforged can be a steadfast ally, a cold-hearted killer, or a visionary in search of meaning.": "战争锻造者是为了在最后的战争中作战而制造的。虽然第一批战锻人是无意识的自动装置，坎尼斯家族投入了大量资源来改进这些钢铁士兵。一个意想不到的突破产生了有知觉的士兵，产生了一些只是勉强接受的新物种。Warforged是由木头和金属制成的，但他们能感受到疼痛和情感。作为武器，他们现在必须找到一个超越战争的目的。一个战神可以是一个坚定的盟友，一个冷酷的杀手，或者是一个寻找意义的幻想家。",
	"Warforged are formed from a blend of organic and inorganic materials. Root-like cords infused with alchemical fluids serve as their muscles, wrapped around a framework of steel, darkwood, or stone. Armored plates form a protective outer shell and reinforce joints. Warforged share a common facial design, with a hinged jaw and crystal eyes embedded beneath a reinforced brow ridge. Beyond these common elements of warforged design, the precise materials and build of a warforged vary based on the purpose for which it was designed.": "Warforged是由有机和无机材料混合而成的。灌注了炼金术液体的根状绳索作为他们的肌肉，包裹着钢铁、黑木或石头的框架。装甲板形成了一个保护性的外壳并加强了关节。战神有一个共同的面部设计，有一个铰链式的下巴和镶嵌在强化的眉棱下的水晶眼睛。除了这些共同的战神设计元素外，战神的精确材料和构造根据其设计目的而有所不同。",
	"Although they were manufactured, warforged are living humanoids. Resting, healing magic, and the {@skill Medicine} skill all provide the same benefits to warforged that they do to other humanoids.": "虽然他们是被制造出来的，但战神是活的人类。休息、治疗魔法和{@skill Medicine}技能都为战神提供了和其他人类一样的好处。",
	"The warforged were built to serve and to fight. For most of their existence, warforged had a clearly defined function and were encouraged to focus purely on that role. The Treaty of Thronehold gave them freedom, but many still struggle both to find a place in the post-war world and to relate to the creatures who created them.": "战神是为了服务和战斗而建造的。在他们存在的大部分时间里，战神有一个明确的功能，并被鼓励纯粹地专注于这个角色。王权条约》给了他们自由，但许多人仍在努力寻找在战后世界的位置，并与创造他们的生物发生联系。",
	"The typical warforged shows little emotion. Many warforged embrace a concrete purpose—such as protecting allies, completing a contract, or exploring a land—and embrace this task as they once did war. However, there are warforged who delight in exploring their feelings, their freedom, and their relationships with others. Most warforged have no interest in religion, but some embrace faith and mysticism, seeking higher purpose and deeper meaning.": "典型的战争锻造者很少表现出情感。许多战神拥护一个具体的目的--比如保护盟友，完成一个合同，或者探索一片土地--并且像他们曾经的战争一样拥护这个任务。然而，也有一些战神乐于探索他们的感情、他们的自由和他们与他人的关系。大多数战神对宗教没有兴趣，但有些人拥抱信仰和神秘主义，寻求更高的目标和更深的意义。",

	"It's usually safe to assume that a half-orc is belligerent and quick to anger, so people watch themselves around an unfamiliar half-orc.

	"You can establish a monstrous creature as just another culture in your campaign, one that has alliances and rivalries with humans, elves, and dwarves. A hobgoblin kingdom might serve as a buffer between a human kingdom and a blighted region overrun by the spawn of Kyuss.

	"Figure out what special ties the character has to other members of the adventuring party. An orc warlock might be the dwarf ranger's sworn enemy, but the two are forced to work together to defeat a mutual foe. Perhaps the kobold sorcerer was the tiefling wizard's familiar, transformed by an irate archmage in return for some petty insult. The hobgoblin paladin might have been human once, but crossed the wrong hag and was cursed to take on an evil guise. A creative tie between a monstrous character and the rest of the party helps make for a memorable campaign.": "弄清楚这个角色与冒险团的其他成员有什么特殊的联系。兽人术士可能是矮人游侠的死敌，但他们两个人被迫一起工作来打败共同的敌人。也许哥布林巫师是铁弗林巫师的熟人，被一个愤怒的大法师改造以换取一些小的侮辱。哥布林圣骑士可能曾经是人类，但遇到了错误的巫婆，被诅咒成了邪恶的模样。在一个怪物角色和党的其他成员之间建立一种创造性的联系，有助于创造一个令人难忘的活动。",

However, the humans of Kessig are different in many respects from those of Gavony, and Nephalia's urban culture is very distinct from the shadow-draped land of Stensia. Diversity among player characters comes not from race, but from each character's home province.": "Innistrad的人口大多是人类，而Innistrad战役中的玩家角色在大多数情况下应该是人类。然而，凯西格的人类在很多方面都与加沃尼的人类不同，而奈法利亚的城市文化与斯滕西亚的阴影之地非常不同。玩家角色之间的多样性不是来自种族，而是来自每个角色的家乡省份。尽管Aetherborn在他们的驱动力和乐趣方面各不相同，但几乎所有的人都有这样的愿望，即从他们被给予的短暂时间中榨取最多的东西。",
	"Whether safe behind the walls of the High City of Thraben or out in the moors with little more than shuttered windows, barred doors, and grim determination to stand against the horrors of the night, the humans of Gavony are the most well-rounded people of Innistrad.": "不管是在Thraben高城的城墙后面，还是在荒野上，除了紧闭的窗户、有栅栏的门和对抗黑夜恐怖的严峻决心之外，Gavony的人类是Innistrad最全面的人。尽管Aetherborn在他们的驱动力和乐趣方面各不相同，但几乎所有的人都有这样的愿望，即从他们被给予的短暂时间中榨取最多的东西。",
	"For the Kessiger, life is work. Kessigers are farmers, millers, weavers, and stonemasons, living close to the land and working hard for every meal. This makes them self-reliant, pragmatic, and plainspoken.": "对凯瑟格人来说，生活就是工作。凯西格人是农民、磨坊主、织工和石匠，他们贴近土地生活，为每一顿饭努力工作。这使他们自力更生、实事求是、直言不讳。不带来快乐就是浪费。尽管Aetherborn在他们的驱动力和乐趣方面各不相同，但几乎所有的人都有这样的愿望，即从他们被给予的短暂时间中榨取最多的东西。",
	"Beneath an ever-present shroud of fog billowing in from the sea, the people of Nephalia maintain a semblance of normalcy, buying and selling goods from across Innistrad in their bustling markets, setting out to sea in tiny fishing boats, or tilling the soggy earth in waterlogged fields.": "在无处不在的海雾笼罩下，尼法利亚的人们保持着一种正常的状态，他们在热闹的市场上买卖来自整个因斯特拉德的商品，乘坐小渔船出海，或者在积水的田地里耕种潮湿的土地。",
	"Countless generations of hardship and proximity to the vampire strongholds—leading to lost children and neighbors—have taught Stensians to guard their hearts. They are proud and fervent in their beliefs but seem brusque or even cold to the people of other provinces.": "无数代的艰难困苦和接近吸血鬼的据点--导致孩子和邻居的丢失--让斯坦西人学会了保护自己的心。他们对自己的信仰感到骄傲和狂热，但对其他省份的人来说却显得粗暴甚至冷漠。几乎所有的人都有这样的愿望，即从他们被给予的短暂时间中榨取最大利益。",
	"Humans are found throughout the plane of Ixalan, both in the lands of Torrezon (now controlled by the Legion of Dusk) and in the Sun Empire. The vampires of the Legion of Dusk were once human, and the peasant and servant populations they rule still are. As the Legion of Dusk conquered Torrezon, its forces drove many human populations before them, including those who first formed the Free Cities and later fled across the ocean to form the core of the Brazen Coalition.": "人类在整个艾克萨兰星球上都能找到，包括托瑞松的土地（现在由黄昏军团控制）和太阳帝国的土地。黄昏军团的吸血鬼曾经是人类，而他们所统治的农民和仆人仍然是人类。当黄昏军团征服托雷松时，它的军队在他们面前驱赶了许多人类人口，包括那些最初形成自由城市，后来逃到大洋彼岸，形成勇敢联盟的核心的人。",
	"Hailing from the merciless and barren land of Keld on the far northern continent of Icehaven, the brutal Keldons are hulking, gray-skinned humans. Though they are often perceived as a horde of brutish, unthinking barbarians and a threat to civilization in all its forms, the Keldons have a deep and rich culture that goes back many centuries. Having endured devastation on a massive scale and lived through their own prophesied apocalyptic judgment, today's Keldons fight to be worthy of their glorious ancestors, their unforgiving home, and their strongest champions.": "残忍的凯尔登人来自冰海大陆遥远的北方无情而贫瘠的土地，他们是笨重的、灰色皮肤的人类。虽然他们经常被认为是一群野蛮的、不假思索的野蛮人，是对所有形式的文明的威胁，但凯尔登人有一个深刻而丰富的文化，可以追溯到许多世纪以前。经历了大规模的破坏，并经历了他们自己预言的世界末日审判，今天的凯尔登人为了配得上他们光荣的祖先、他们无情的家园和他们最强大的冠军而战斗。",
	"The River Heralds are merfolk—a race of amphibious humanoids at home throughout the oceans, rivers, and rain forests of Ixalan. They stand between seven and eight feet tall, with skin that ranges from deep burgundy through many shades of violet and blue, to green, bright orange, and yellow. They are humanlike in shape, but have long fins extending from their shoulders, forearms, middle backs, and calves. Frills of fins also protrude from the backs of their heads. All merfolk can breathe air or filter oxygen from the water, and they can walk on land or swim with equal ease.": "河流使者是人鱼--一个在伊萨兰的海洋、河流和雨林中安家的两栖人形种族。他们身高在七到八英尺之间，皮肤从深酒红色到许多紫色和蓝色，再到绿色、鲜橙色和黄色。他们的形状类似于人类，但有长长的鳍，从他们的肩膀、前臂、背部中部和小腿延伸出来。鳍的褶皱也从他们的头的后面伸出来。所有的人鱼都可以呼吸空气或从水中过滤氧气，他们可以在陆地上行走或游泳，同样轻松自如。在世界末日的审判中，今天的凯尔登人为了配得上他们光荣的祖先、他们无情的家园和他们最强大的冠军而战斗。",
	"Blue merfolk often have burgundy or magenta on their faces and chests, with lighter shades of blue and purple elsewhere. Their eyes are red, orange, or blue, and their long, thin, and elegant fins resemble scarves or veils of fine fabric. They swim easily, even upstream, and clamber over rocks and through rapids with ease. They prefer to dwell in shallow waters, but spend a fair amount of time on land as well.": "蓝色人鱼族的脸上和胸前通常有酒红色或洋红色，其他地方有较浅的蓝色和紫色。他们的眼睛是红色、橙色或蓝色，他们的鳍长而薄，优雅，像围巾或细布的面纱。它们很容易游动，甚至逆流而上，并轻松地爬过岩石和穿过激流。他们喜欢居住在浅水区，但也有相当多的时间在陆地上。他们可以在陆地上行走或游泳，同样轻松。",
	"Green merfolk generally have yellow chests and pale green faces, shading to dark blues and purples on their backs and limbs. The patterns on their skin suggest the colors of the tree frogs common in the rain forest, as do their eyes of orange, lime green, or sky blue. Their fins are relatively short and thick. They climb trees with ease, move through undergrowth unhindered, and often wield magic to shape vines and branches to their will.": "绿色人鱼一般有黄色的胸部和淡绿色的脸，在他们的背部和四肢上逐渐变成深蓝色和紫色。他们皮肤上的花纹是雨林中常见的树蛙的颜色，他们的眼睛也是橙色、青绿色或天蓝色。它们的鳍相对短而厚。他们轻松地爬上树，不受阻碍地穿过灌木丛，并经常挥舞着魔法，按照自己的意愿塑造藤蔓和树枝。这些人最初形成了自由城，后来逃到大洋彼岸，形成了勇敢联盟的核心。",
	"Orcs originally came from the same mountainous region where the kingdom of Torrezon was born, and they have been enemies of the Legion of Dusk since it was originally formed. The entire race has been declared anathema by the Church of Torrezon, and after centuries of fighting the Legion, the orcs have dwindled to only a few hundred in number. Some still live on remote islands near Torrezon, but many have joined the Brazen Coalition to serve on pirate ships—taking on any role that calls for an abundance of sheer muscle.": "兽人最初来自托雷松王国诞生的那个山区，自从黄昏军团最初成立以来，他们一直是黄昏军团的敌人。整个种族被托雷松教会宣布为不祥之物，经过几个世纪与军团的战斗，兽人的数量已经减少到只有几百人。有些人仍然生活在托雷松附近的偏远岛屿上，但许多人已经加入了勇敢联盟，在海盗船上服务--承担任何需要大量纯粹肌肉的角色。",
	"Orcs are tall, standing head and shoulders above most humans, and are generally twice as broad. They often accentuate their bulging muscles by wearing tight-fitting bands and accessories around the thickest parts of their arms and necks. Their skin color ranges from light brown through gray to almost jet-black.": "兽人很高，比大多数人类高出一头，而且一般是两倍的宽度。他们经常通过在手臂和脖子最粗的部位佩戴紧身带和配件来突出他们隆起的肌肉。他们的皮肤颜色从浅棕色到灰色再到几乎是漆黑色。在纯粹的肌肉的舞动下，今天的凯尔登人为了配得上他们光荣的祖先、他们无情的家园和他们最强大的冠军而战斗。",
	"Sirens are at home along the waters of the Stormwreck Sea. They settle on rocky coasts and remote islands, and even on floating piles of kelp. Sirens are mercurial creatures who can turn in an instant from lonely to repulsed, from desirous to hateful, from welcoming to irritated, from loving to murderous—and then back again. They are fascinated with ships, and enjoy toying with them. One siren might call out to a passing crew for company, only to capriciously draw the ship into an entangling mass of kelp. Another might lure a vessel onto jagged rocks so as to study the wreckage and learn more about the strange contraption. But as the number of Brazen Coalition ships passing through siren-controlled waters has increased over the years, a growing number of sirens have decided to satisfy their curiosity by taking positions on ship crews—including, in at least one case, the position of captain.": "海妖在风暴残骸海的水域中是个家。它们定居在岩石海岸和偏远的岛屿上，甚至在漂浮的海带堆上。海妖是一种多变的生物，它们可以在瞬间从孤独变成厌恶，从渴望变成憎恨，从欢迎变成恼怒，从爱变成谋杀--然后再回来。它们对船只很着迷，并喜欢玩弄它们。一只海妖可能会呼唤过往的船员作伴，但却任性地把船引向一团纠缠在一起的海藻。另一个海妖可能会把一艘船引到锯齿状的岩石上，以便研究残骸，了解更多关于这个奇怪的装置。但是，随着多年来通过海妖控制水域的勇敢联盟船只数量的增加，越来越多的海妖决定通过在船员中任职来满足他们的好奇心--包括，至少在一个案例中，船长的职位。 他们为无愧于他们光荣的祖先、无情的家园和最强大的冠军而战斗。这些人最初形成了自由城市，后来逃到大洋彼岸，形成了勇敢联盟的核心。他们渴望从短暂的时间里榨取最大的利益。",
	"Sirens are humanoid creatures with birdlike features. Their long, slender arms extend into powerful wings that easily carry their light frames into the air. Their fingers bear sharp claws but are nimble enough to wield weapons and perform fine manipulation. Crests of feathery plumage start": "海妖是具有鸟类特征的人形生物。他们细长的手臂延伸成强大的翅膀，可以轻松地将他们轻巧的框架带到空中。他们的手指带有锋利的爪子，但却足够灵活，可以挥舞武器，进行精细的操作。多年来，越来越多的海妖决定通过在船员中任职来满足他们的好奇心--至少在一个案例中，包括船长的职位。他们为配得上他们光荣的祖先、他们无情的家园和他们最强大的冠军而战斗。",
	"The Legion of Dusk is dominated by an aristocratic class made up of vampires. They are faster and stronger than most humans, and gifted with supernatural abilities that made them the most formidable force in their homeland. Now, as they push into the depths of Ixalan in search of the Immortal Sun, they bring this strength to bear against all who would resist their advance.": "黄昏军团由一个由吸血鬼组成的贵族阶层主导。他们比大多数人类更快、更强，并具有超自然的能力，使他们成为故乡最强大的力量。现在，当他们进入艾克萨兰的深处寻找不朽的太阳时，他们把这种力量用来对付所有抵制他们前进的人。",
	"For many vampires, the Rite of Redemption that transforms a human into a vampire is an act of personal sacrifice, paving the way for a promised glorious age. These vampires embody Torrezon's noble tradition in Ixalan. They are often guided by their dual loyalties to church and crown, believing that the monarch acts with righteous purpose. As such, these vampires carry themselves with a self-assurance that is both imposing and imperial. Other societies seem inferior and unclean compared to their own, leading them to feel that they have a right to claim new lands despite the presence of people already inhabiting those lands.": "对许多吸血鬼来说，将人类转变为吸血鬼的救赎仪式是一种个人牺牲行为，为承诺的光辉时代铺平道路。这些吸血鬼体现了托瑞松在伊克萨兰的崇高传统。他们通常以对教会和王室的双重忠诚为指导，相信君主的行为具有正义的目的。因此，这些吸血鬼带着一种自我肯定，既威严又有帝王风范。其他社会与他们自己的社会相比显得低劣和不洁，导致他们觉得他们有权利要求新的土地，尽管这些土地上已经有人在居住了。",
	"Other vampires view vampirism merely as a means to attain a powerful advantage over others. These vampires are fierce, ruthless, and often cruel, relishing conflict—be it political or armed—as a means of demonstrating their superiority. Many are politically ambitious, invoking Torrezon's hierarchy when it serves their interests, but ignoring all the rules of church, state, and morality when those rules become a burden. When these vampires come to Ixalan, they are conquerors, motivated by the prospect of personal glory and the accumulation of riches. Those who achieve wealth and power display it ostentatiously.": "另一些吸血鬼则仅仅将吸血鬼视为获得对他人的强大优势的一种手段。这些吸血鬼凶猛、无情，而且往往很残酷，他们喜欢冲突--无论是政治冲突还是武装冲突--以此来显示他们的优势。许多人都有政治野心，当托雷松的等级制度符合他们的利益时，他们会援引这些制度，但当这些制度成为一种负担时，他们会无视所有的教会、国家和道德规则。当这些吸血鬼来到伊萨兰时，他们是征服者，被个人荣耀和财富积累的前景所激励。那些获得财富和权力的人浮夸地展示自己的财富和权力，导致他们觉得他们有权利要求获得新的土地，尽管这些土地上已经有人在居住。",
	"The core of every vampire's nature is the Feast of Blood. Though it is forbidden to feed on human citizens of Torrezon, including the human sailors and servants who accompany the vampire conquistadors to Ixalan, vampires are encouraged to feed on outsiders and heretics. The Feast of Blood sends new life essence flowing through the vampire who partakes of it, manifesting as even greater strength and speed.": "每个吸血鬼本性的核心是血的盛宴。虽然禁止吸食托瑞松的人类公民，包括陪同吸血鬼征服者前往伊克萨兰的人类水手和仆人，但鼓励吸血鬼吸食外来者和异教徒。血液的盛宴让新的生命精华在吸食它的吸血鬼身上流淌，表现为更大的力量和速度。",
	"Vedalken have an unusual view of progress. They believe that nothing is perfect, nor can it ever be perfect—and they rejoice in this. Every imperfection is a chance for improvement, and progress is an endless march toward a state of perfection that can never actually be reached. Thus, pointing out imperfection is hardly an insult—which leads vedalken to note flaws and problems with an enthusiasm that members of other races sometimes find exasperating.": "维达肯人对进步有一种不同寻常的看法。他们相信，没有什么是完美的，也不可能是完美的--他们为此感到高兴。每一个不完美都是一个改进的机会，而进步是向着一个实际上永远不可能达到的完美状态的无止境的迈进。因此，指出不完美很难说是一种侮辱--这导致维达尔肯人以一种其他种族成员有时会感到气愤的热情来注意缺陷和问题。",
	"This enthusiasm extends to every aspect of vedalken work, both practical and theoretical. They are curious and excitable, and often become deeply engrossed in their labors. It's not uncommon for a vedalken to spend hours on end caught up in the details of an abstract question or a minute engineering problem. Vedalken can be utterly oblivious to their surroundings while meditating on thorny issues, and they are prone to launching into lengthy explanations of their current research, since most find that talking about a problem often leads to a solution.": "这种热情延伸到了vedalken工作的各个方面，包括实践和理论方面。他们好奇心强，容易激动，常常深深地沉浸在自己的工作中。一个维达尔肯人花上几个小时沉浸在一个抽象问题或一个微小的工程问题的细节中，这并不罕见。在沉思棘手的问题时，vedalken可以完全忘却周围的环境，而且他们很容易对当前的研究进行冗长的解释，因为大多数人发现，谈论一个问题往往会导致一个解决方案。",
	"As a rule, vedalken are gregarious in conversation. However, they are quite circumspect concerning their personal lives, and they engage more with ideas than with people. They form close friendships based around mutual interests or compelling disagreements, and their interactions focus on their thoughts about those issues rather than their feelings about them. Emotional dynamics don't particularly interest vedalken, either as a conversational topic or a field of study. When they talk about their feelings, it is primarily to provide information that might be helpful to others. For example, a vedalken might tell her colleagues, \"I'm feeling irritated right now, so I might not be reacting appropriately. Perhaps we should continue this later.\" But any questions about the cause of the irritation are likely to be brushed off as being irrelevant to the situation.": "通常情况下，vedalken在谈话中是很热情的。然而，他们对自己的个人生活相当谨慎，而且他们更多的是与想法而不是与人打交道。他们围绕共同的兴趣或令人信服的分歧形成亲密的友谊，他们的互动集中在他们对这些问题的想法上，而不是他们对这些问题的感受。无论是作为一个谈话话题还是作为一个研究领域，情绪动态对vedalken并不特别感兴趣。当他们谈论自己的感受时，主要是为了提供可能对他人有帮助的信息。例如，一个vedalken可能会告诉她的同事：\"我现在感觉很烦躁，所以我的反应可能不恰当。也许我们应该稍后继续讨论。\" 但是，任何关于刺激原因的问题都可能被刷掉，因为这与情况无关。",
	"Most vedalken care far more about invention and inquiry than about politics. They would rather unlock the hidden potential of aether-based devices than dwell on the question of how aether should be distributed to the Consulate's citizens. For that reason, though vedalken are found both among the officials of the Consulate and among the renegades, their dedication to either cause often lacks the partisan fervor found in the members of other races": "大多数韦达肯人关心的是发明和探索，而不是政治。他们宁愿解开基于乙太的设备的隐藏潜力，也不愿纠缠于乙太应该如何分配给领事馆的公民的问题。由于这个原因，尽管在领事馆的官员和叛徒中都能找到vedalken，但他们对任何一项事业的奉献往往缺乏在其他种族成员中发现的党派热忱。但是，任何关于刺激原因的问题都可能被刷掉，因为这与情况无关。"
