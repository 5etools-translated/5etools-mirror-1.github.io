	"The astral brig is the standard githyanki military vessel. It requires a crew of five and can transport up to sixty passengers. A brig is 90 feet long and 30 feet wide, with two levels below decks for quarters and storage space. It is equipped with two ballistae, each one operated by a pair of crew members, and has a top speed of 12 miles per hour.": "星际旅店是标准的Githyanki军舰。它需要五名船员，可以运送多达60名乘客。一艘双桅船有90英尺长，30英尺宽，甲板下有两层是宿舍和储藏空间。它配备了两台弹炮，每台由一对船员操作，最高时速为12英里。",
	"An astral skiff is operated by a crew of three and carries up to a dozen passengers. The githyanki employ this small vessel, 30 feet long and 10 feet wide, for patrols in the Astral Plane and for quick raids in pursuit of specific objects on the Material Plane. A skiff has a top speed of 15 miles per hour. It lacks weapons aside from those carried by its passengers and has a limited amount of storage space.": "一艘星际快艇由三名船员操作，最多可载十几名乘客。githyanki使用这种30英尺长、10英尺宽的小船，在星界巡逻，并在物质界快速突袭追捕特定的物体。小艇的最高速度为每小时15英里。除了乘客携带的武器外，它缺乏武器，而且储存空间有限。",
	"Airships are relatively rare in Acquisitions Incorporated, which is thought to hold no more than five in its fleet. But the unparalleled usefulness of these craft in commerce—and in combat—makes the company-standard battle balloon a much-coveted upgrade for any franchise.": "飞艇在收购公司中比较少见，据说它的舰队中不超过五艘。但这些飞船在商业和战斗中无与伦比的实用性，使得公司标准的战斗气球成为任何特许经营权都梦寐以求的升级。",
	"Professional secrecy and aggressive marketing make it unclear where the airship originated. Some say battle balloons were an original design created by the Heuristic Arcane Research and Development department of Acquisitions Incorporated. But the wizards of Halruaa developed similar skyships in ages past, and the Cult of the Dragon has been seen with flying ships of its own. Still, among the small number of factions and organizations known to possess or build airships, Acquisitions Incorporated might be the best known for its high-profile aerial escapades. It's certain that neither the mages of Halruaa nor the members of the Cult of the Dragon ever crewed a battle balloon with keg robots, or used one to squash a tyrannosaurus flat.": "专业的保密性和积极的营销使人们不清楚飞艇的起源。有人说战斗气球是由收购公司的启发式奥术研究和开发部门创造的原始设计。但哈尔鲁阿的巫师们在过去的年代里开发了类似的飞艇，而龙的崇拜也被看到有自己的飞行船。不过，在已知拥有或建造飞艇的少数派别和组织中，收购公司可能是最出名的，因为它有高调的空中逃亡活动。可以肯定的是，无论是哈尔鲁阿的法师还是神龙教的成员，都没有在战斗气球上安装过水桶机器人，也没有用它来压扁暴龙。",
	"The Hard Cloud is Acquisitions Incorporated's company flagship, and as such, bears special note. The great battle balloon bristles with armaments, including a vicious dragon-slaying spear at the fore that has seen use more than once. The Hard Cloud is a veteran of numerous combat operations, and it has so far come out in one piece. Beyond the tales told of the vessel's exploits, rumors abound regarding the wondrous vehicle. Is it powered by a bound efreeti, as some have said? Does the hold contain clones of every high-ranking member of Acquisitions Incorporated, including Omin Dran himself? Does the mess, in fact, employ a terrifying ghostly chef? The answers lie below decks, where few have had the opportunity to learn the truth.": "硬云号是收购公司的旗舰，因此，需要特别注意。这个巨大的战斗气球上布满了武器装备，包括前面的一把凶恶的屠龙枪，它已经不止一次被使用过了。\"硬云 \"号是多次作战的老兵，到目前为止，它都是完整无缺的。除了关于这艘船的故事外，关于这艘神奇的车辆的传言也比比皆是。它是否像有些人说的那样，由一个被捆绑的伊夫里提提供动力？舱内是否有收购公司所有高级成员的克隆体，包括奥明-德兰本人？这艘船是否真的雇佣了一个可怕的幽灵厨师？答案就在甲板下，很少有人有机会了解真相。",
	"The standard design of an Acquisitions Incorporated-grade airship features an enormous balloon covered in a rope net. Trailing lines connect the balloon to the vessel of metal and wood suspended below. In the center of the deck, directly below the balloon, sits a large magic furnace, whose formidable lifting power is rumored to involve trapped elementals. The airship's captain controls the arcane furnace and directs forward thrust by way of a propeller located at the back of the ship, helming the craft with a wheel positioned in the bow. Metal runners below the ship allow a battle balloon to land on the ground.": "收购公司级飞艇的标准设计是一个覆盖着绳网的巨大气球。拖曳的线条将气球与悬挂在下面的金属和木材的容器连接起来。在甲板的中央，气球的正下方，坐着一个大型的魔法炉，据传其强大的提升力涉及被困的元素。飞船的船长控制着奥术炉，并通过位于船尾的螺旋桨来指挥前进的推力，用位于船头的轮子来控制飞船。船下的金属滑道允许战斗气球降落在地面上。",
	"Each franchise or organization customizes the offensive capability of its airships, but most battle balloons feature multiple harpoon guns, perfect for fighting and snaring aerial threats. Battle balloons that see a lot of combat are typically well stocked with other ranged weapons and polearms for ship-to-ship and crew-to-crew fighting.": "每个特许经营商或组织都会定制其飞艇的攻击能力，但大多数战斗气球都有多个鱼叉枪，非常适合打击和捕捉空中威胁。有大量战斗的战斗气球通常都备有其他远程武器和杆状武器，用于船对船和船员对船员的战斗。",
	"Whether privately financed or loaned out by Head Office under extraordinarily cautious terms, battle balloons can be customized with unique equipment—different siege weapons, lifting and cargo gear, and so forth—to make each airship unique. However, the most potent weapon featured on most Acquisitions Incorporated battle balloons is the green flame arbalester, a massive ballista whose bolts pulse with arcane power and detonate with formidable explosive force wherever they hit.": "无论是私人融资还是由总部以特别谨慎的条件借出，战斗气球都可以定制独特的设备--不同的攻城武器、起重和货运设备等，使每艘飞艇都独一无二。然而，大多数收购公司的战斗气球上最强大的武器是绿色火焰阿巴利斯特，这是一个巨大的弹弓，它的炮弹带有神秘的力量，无论击中哪里都会引爆巨大的爆炸力。",
	"Battle balloons and mechanical beholders are vehicles, and as such, they have special rules associated with them. Most pertinently, a vehicle has the six ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and the corresponding modifiers. The Strength of a vehicle expresses its size and weight. Dexterity represents its ease of handling. A vehicle's Constitution covers its durability and the quality of its construction. Vehicles usually have a score of 0 in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. If a vehicle has a 0 in a score, it automatically fails any ability check or saving throw that uses that score. How a vehicle is crewed and what actions it can take on its turn are described in the stat block for the vehicle.": "战斗气球和机械人是交通工具，因此，它们有与之相关的特殊规则。最相关的是，一辆车有六个能力分数（力量、灵巧、体质、智力、智慧和魅力）和相应的修改器。车辆的力量表示其大小和重量。灵巧代表它的易操作性。车辆的体质包括它的耐用性和它的结构质量。车辆的智力、智慧和魅力通常为0分。如果一辆车的某项得分为0，那么它的任何能力检查或蓄力投掷都会自动失败。车辆如何配备人员，以及它在其回合中可以采取什么行动，在车辆的状态块中有描述。",
	"A battle balloon is perhaps the most sought-after of the mobile headquarters options available to Acquisitions Incorporated franchises. The versatility of an airship allows for the rapid shipping of goods, mercenaries, and loot. Such a vessel also allows a quick escape from sticky developments and deals gone bad.": "战斗气球也许是收购公司特许经营的移动总部选项中最抢手的一个。飞艇的多功能性允许快速运送货物、雇佣兵和战利品。这样的船只还可以快速逃离棘手的事态发展和变坏的交易。",
	"A Demon Grinder is a bulky, armored coach that rumbles loudly as it crushes obstacles and enemies in its path with the help of a swinging wrecking ball. Iron jaws are mounted on the front of the vehicle, which handles like a garbage truck.": "恶魔研磨机是一种笨重的装甲马车，当它在摆动的破坏球的帮助下粉碎障碍物和路径上的敌人时，发出巨大的隆隆声。铁钳安装在车辆的前面，它的操作方式就像一辆垃圾车。",
	"A Devil's Ride is a two-wheeled infernal war machine that handles like a motorcycle. It has spiked wheels, a screaming engine, and a cowl shaped vaguely like a grinning devil's visage, with horns for handle bars. What the vehicle lacks in weapons, it makes up for with speed and maneuverability.": "恶魔之骑是一种两轮的地狱战争机器，操控起来像一辆摩托车。它有带刺的轮子，一个尖叫的引擎，以及一个依稀像笑着的魔鬼面孔的罩子，有角的车把。该车在武器方面的不足，在速度和机动性方面得到了弥补。",
	"Galleys are long vessels that rely on sails and sizable rowing crews to move. These ships can carry siege weapons and soldiers to war or transport large amounts of cargo for merchants. No matter the ship's purpose, the crew almost always hires extra protection, since galleys make large, cargo-rich targets for pirates.": "大帆船是一种长船，依靠风帆和可观的划船人员来移动。这些船可以携带攻城武器和士兵去打仗，或者为商人运输大量的货物。无论船只的用途如何，船员们几乎都会雇佣额外的保护措施，因为大帆船是海盗们的大型货物目标。",
