The Strength of a vehicle expresses its size and weight. Dexterity represents its ease of handling. A vehicle's Constitution covers its durability and the quality of its construction. Vehicles usually have a score of 0 in Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. If a vehicle has a 0 in a score, it automatically fails any ability check or saving throw that uses that score. How a vehicle is crewed and what actions it can take on its turn are described in the stat block for the vehicle.": "\u6218\u6597\u6c14\u7403\u548c\u673a\u68b0\u4eba\u662f\u4ea4\u901a\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u6709\u4e0e\u4e4b\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u89c4\u5219\u3002\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u4e00\u8f86\u8f66\u6709\u516d\u4e2a\u80fd\u529b\u5206\u6570\uff08\u529b\u91cf\u3001\u7075\u5de7\u3001\u4f53\u8d28\u3001\u667a\u529b\u3001\u667a\u6167\u548c\u9b45\u529b\uff09\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u5668\u3002\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u529b\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u5176\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u91cd\u91cf\u3002\u7075\u5de7\u4ee3\u8868\u5b83\u7684\u6613\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u3002\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u4f53\u8d28\u5305\u62ec\u5b83\u7684\u8010\u7528\u6027\u548c\u5b83\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u667a\u529b\u3001\u667a\u6167\u548c\u9b45\u529b\u901a\u5e38\u4e3a0\u5206\u3002\u5982\u679c\u4e00\u8f86\u8f66\u7684\u67d0\u9879\u5f97\u5206\u4e3a0\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u5b83\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u80fd\u529b\u68c0\u67e5\u6216\u84c4\u529b\u6295\u63b7\u90fd\u4f1a\u81ea\u52a8\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u8f66\u8f86\u5982\u4f55\u914d\u5907\u4eba\u5458\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b83\u5728\u5176\u56de\u5408\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u91c7\u53d6\u4ec0\u4e48\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u5728\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u5757\u4e2d\u6709\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002",
