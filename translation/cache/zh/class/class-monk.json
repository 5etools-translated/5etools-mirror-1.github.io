	"Her fists a blur as they deflect an incoming hail of arrows, a half-elf springs over a barricade and throws herself into the massed ranks of hobgoblins on the other side. She whirls among them, knocking their blows aside and sending them reeling, until at last she stands alone.": "她的拳头在挡住射来的箭雨时变得模糊不清，一个半精灵跳过路障，把自己扔进另一边的地精群中。她在他们中间打转，把他们的打击打到一边，使他们陷入困境，直到最后她独自站起来。",
	"Taking a deep breath, a human covered in tattoos settles into a battle stance. As the first charging orcs reach him, he exhales and a blast of fire roars from his mouth, engulfing his foes.": "深吸一口气，一个满身纹身的人类摆好了战斗姿态。当第一个冲锋的兽人到达他面前时，他呼出一口气，一股火焰从他口中咆哮而出，吞噬了他的敌人。",
	"Moving with the silence of the night, a black-clad halfling steps into a shadow beneath an arch and emerges from another inky shadow on a balcony a stone's throw away. She slides her blade free of its cloth-wrapped scabbard and peers through the open window at the tyrant prince, so vulnerable in the grip of sleep.": "伴随着夜的寂静，一个黑衣半身人步入拱门下的阴影中，从一箭之遥的阳台上的另一个墨色阴影中走出来。她把刀从包着布的刀鞘里滑出来，透过打开的窗户看向暴君王子，他在睡眠的控制下如此脆弱。",
	"Whatever their discipline, monks are united in their ability to magically harness the energy that flows in their bodies. Whether channeled as a striking display of combat prowess or a subtler focus of defensive ability and speed, this energy infuses all that a monk does.": "无论他们的学科是什么，僧侣们都有一个共同点，那就是他们能够神奇地驾驭他们体内流动的能量。无论是以引人注目的战斗力展示，还是以防御能力和速度的微妙焦点来引导，这种能量都渗透到了僧侣所做的一切。",
	"Monks make careful study of a magical energy that most monastic traditions call ki. This energy is an element of the magic that suffuses the multiverse—specifically, the element that flows through living bodies. Monks harness this power within themselves to create magical effects and exceed their bodies' physical capabilities, and some of their special attacks can hinder the flow of ki in their opponents. Using this energy, monks channel uncanny speed and strength into their unarmed strikes. As they gain experience, their martial training and their mastery of ki gives them more power over their bodies and the bodies of their foes.": "僧侣们对一种神奇的能量进行仔细研究，大多数僧侣的传统称之为 \"气\"。这种能量是弥漫在多元宇宙中的魔法的一种元素--具体地说，是流经活体的元素。僧侣们利用自己体内的这种力量来创造神奇的效果，并超越他们身体的物理能力，他们的一些特殊攻击可以阻碍对手体内的气的流动。利用这种能量，僧侣们将不可思议的速度和力量引入他们的徒手打击。随着他们经验的增加，他们的武术训练和对气的掌握使他们对自己的身体和敌人的身体有更多的力量。",
	"Small walled cloisters dot the landscapes of the worlds of D&D, tiny refuges from the flow of ordinary life, where time seems to stand still. The monks who live there seek personal perfection through contemplation and rigorous training. Many entered the monastery as children, sent to live there when their parents died, when food couldn't be found to support them, or in return for some kindness that the monks had performed for their families.": "在D&D世界的风景中，有小墙的回廊点缀其间，是远离普通生活的小小避难所，在那里时间似乎静止了。住在那里的僧侣们通过沉思和严格的训练寻求个人的完美。许多人在小时候就进入了修道院，当他们的父母去世时，当找不到食物供养他们时，或者为了回报僧侣们为他们的家庭所做的一些善举，他们就被送到那里去生活。",
	"Some monks live entirely apart from the surrounding population, secluded from anything that might impede their spiritual progress. Others are sworn to isolation, emerging only to serve as spies or assassins at the command of their leader, a noble patron, or some other mortal or divine power.": "有些僧侣完全与周围的人分开居住，与任何可能阻碍他们精神进步的东西隔离。其他人则发誓要与世隔绝，只在他们的领袖、贵族赞助人或其他一些凡人或神灵的命令下出现，充当间谍或刺客。",
	"The majority of monks don't shun their neighbors, making frequent visits to nearby towns or villages and exchanging their service for food and other goods. As versatile warriors, monks often end up protecting their neighbors from monsters or tyrants.": "大多数僧侣并不回避他们的邻居，他们经常访问附近的城镇或村庄，用他们的服务换取食物和其他物品。作为多才多艺的战士，僧侣们最终往往会保护他们的邻居免受怪物或暴君的侵害。",
	"For a monk, becoming an adventurer means leaving a structured, communal lifestyle to become a wanderer. This can be a harsh transition, and monks don't undertake it lightly. Those who leave their cloisters take their work seriously, approaching their adventures as personal tests of their physical and spiritual growth. As a rule, monks care little for material wealth and are driven by a desire to accomplish a greater mission than merely slaying monsters and plundering their treasure.": "对于僧侣来说，成为一名冒险家意味着离开结构化的公共生活方式，成为一名流浪者。这可能是一个严酷的转变，僧侣们不会轻易地进行这种转变。那些离开修道院的人认真对待他们的工作，把他们的冒险当作对他们身体和精神成长的个人考验。通常，僧侣们对物质财富不屑一顾，他们渴望完成一项更伟大的使命，而不仅仅是杀死怪物和掠夺他们的财宝。",
	"As you make your monk character, think about your connection to the monastery where you learned your skills and spent your formative years. Were you an orphan or a child left on the monastery's threshold? Did your parents promise you to the monastery in gratitude for a service performed by the monks? Did you enter this secluded life to hide from a crime you committed? Or did you choose the monastic life for yourself?": "当你塑造你的僧侣角色时，想一想你与你学习技能和度过成长岁月的寺院的关系。你是一个孤儿，还是一个被留在寺院门槛上的孩子？你的父母是否为了感谢僧侣们的服务而将你许配给寺院？你进入这种隐居生活是为了躲避你犯下的罪行吗？还是你为自己选择了寺院生活？",
	"Consider why you left. Did the head of your monastery choose you for a particularly important mission beyond the cloister? Perhaps you were cast out because of some violation of the community's rules. Did you dread leaving, or were you happy to go? Is there something you hope to accomplish outside the monastery? Are you eager to return to your home?": "考虑一下你为什么离开。你的寺院负责人是否选择你去执行一个超越回廊的特别重要的任务？也许你是因为违反了社区的某些规则而被赶出来的。你是害怕离开，还是乐意离开？你是否有希望在修道院之外完成的事情？你是否渴望回到你的家？",
	"As a result of the structured life of a monastic community and the discipline required to harness ki, monks are almost always lawful in alignment.": "由于僧侣社区的结构化生活和驾驭基业所需的纪律，僧侣们几乎都是合法的排列。",
	"You can make a monk quickly by following these suggestions. First, make Dexterity your highest ability score, followed by Wisdom. Second, choose the {@background hermit} background.": "按照这些建议，你可以很快地做出一个和尚。首先，让灵巧成为你最高的能力得分，其次是智慧。第二，选择（%0%）的背景。",
	"Do not mistake my silence for acceptance of your villainy. While you blustered and threatened, I've planned four different ways to snap your neck with my bare hands.": "不要把我的沉默误认为是对你的恶行的接受。当你虚张声势和威胁的时候，我已经计划了四种不同的方式，徒手拧断你的脖子。",
	"Monks walk a path of contradiction. They study their art as a wizard does, and like a wizard, they wear no armor and typically eschew weapons. Yet they are deadly combatants, their abilities on a par with those of a raging barbarian or a superbly trained fighter. Monks embrace this seeming contradiction, for it speaks to the core of all monastic study. By coming to know oneself completely, one learns much of the wider world.": "僧侣走的是一条矛盾的道路。他们像巫师一样研究他们的艺术，像巫师一样，他们不穿盔甲，通常避开武器。然而，他们是致命的战斗员，他们的能力与那些狂暴的野蛮人或训练有素的战士不相上下。僧侣们接受这种看似矛盾的现象，因为它道出了所有僧侣研究的核心。通过完全了解自己，人们可以了解到更广阔的世界。",
	"A monk's focus on inner mastery leads many such individuals to become detached from society, more concerned with their personal experience than with happenings elsewhere. Adventuring monks are a rare breed of an already rare type of character, taking their quest for perfection beyond the walls of the monastery into the world at large.": "僧侣专注于内心的掌握，导致许多这样的人脱离社会，更关心他们的个人经历而不是其他地方发生的事情。冒险的僧侣是一种罕见的人物类型，他们把对完美的追求从寺院的围墙中带到了整个世界。",
	"Playing a monk character offers many intriguing opportunities to try something different. To distinguish your monk character even further, consider the options in the sections that follow.": "扮演僧侣角色提供了许多耐人寻味的机会来尝试不同的东西。为了使你的僧侣角色更加与众不同，请考虑下面几节中的选项。",
	"A monk studies in a monastery in preparation for a life of asceticism. Most of those who enter a monastery make it their home for the rest of their lives, with the exception of adventurers and others who have reason to leave. For those individuals, a monastery might serve as a refuge between excursions to the world or as a source of support in times of need.": "僧侣在寺院中学习，准备过苦行僧的生活。除了冒险家和其他有理由离开的人之外，大多数进入寺院的人都把它作为自己余生的家。对于这些人来说，寺院可以作为他们游历世界之间的一个避难所，或者在需要时作为支持的来源。",
	"What sort of place was your monastery, and where is it located? Did attending it contribute to your experience in an unusual or distinctive way?": "你的寺院是一个什么样的地方，它位于哪里？参加它是否以不寻常或独特的方式对你的经历有所贡献？",

	"Even in the monastic lifestyle, which eschews materialism and personal possessions, symbolism plays an important part in defining the identity of an order. Some monastic orders treat certain creatures with special regard, either because the creature is tied to the order's history or because it serves as an example of a quality the monks seek to emulate.": "即使在摒弃物质主义和个人财产的修道院生活方式中，象征主义也在确定一个教团的身份方面发挥着重要作用。一些修道会特别重视某些生物，因为这些生物与修道会的历史有关，或者因为它是僧侣们寻求效仿的品质的典范。",
	"If your character's monastery had a special icon, you might wear a crude image of the creature somewhere inconspicuous on your clothing to serve as an identifying mark. Or perhaps your order's icon does not have a physical form but is expressed through a gesture or a posture that you adopt, and which other monks might know how to interpret.": "如果你的角色所在的寺院有一个特殊的圣像，你可以在衣服上某个不显眼的地方佩戴一个粗糙的生物形象，作为一个识别标志。或者，你的教团的圣像没有实体形式，而是通过你的一个手势或姿势来表达，其他僧侣可能知道如何解释。",

	"During your studies, you were likely under the tutelage of a master who imparted to you the precepts of the order.
