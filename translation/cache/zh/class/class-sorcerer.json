{
	"Golden eyes flashing, a human stretches out her hand and unleashes the dragonfire that burns in her veins. As an inferno rages around her foes, leathery wings spread from her back and she takes to the air.": "金色的眼睛闪闪发光，一个人类伸出她的手，释放出她血管中燃烧的龙火。当地狱之火在她的敌人周围肆虐时，皮革般的翅膀从她的背上展开，她飞上了天空。",
	"Long hair whipped by a conjured wind, a half-elf spreads his arms wide and throws his head back. Lifting him momentarily off the ground, a wave of magic surges up in him, through him, and out from him in a mighty blast of lightning.": "半精灵的长发被魔法风吹动，他张开双臂，把头向后甩。瞬间将他抬离地面，一股魔力在他体内涌动，穿过他，从他身上喷出一股强大的闪电。",
	"Crouching behind a stalagmite, a halfling points a finger at a charging troglodyte. A blast of fire springs from her finger to strike the creature. She ducks back behind the rock formation with a grin, unaware that her wild magic has turned her skin bright blue.": "蹲在石笋后面，一个半身人用手指着一个冲锋的蛙人。一股火焰从她的手指中喷出，击中了这个生物。她笑着躲到岩层后面，不知道她的野生魔法已经把她的皮肤变成了明亮的蓝色。",
	"Sorcerers carry a magical birthright conferred upon them by an exotic bloodline, some otherworldly influence, or exposure to unknown cosmic forces. One can't study sorcery as one learns a language, any more than one can learn to live a legendary life. No one chooses sorcery; the power chooses the sorcerer.": "巫师拥有一种由异国血统、某些异世界的影响或接触未知宇宙力量而赋予他们的魔法天赋。一个人不可能像学习语言一样学习巫术，就像一个人不可能学会过传奇的生活一样。没有人选择巫术；力量选择巫师。",
	"Magic is a part of every sorcerer, suffusing body, mind, and spirit with a latent power that waits to be tapped. Some sorcerers wield magic that springs from an ancient bloodline infused with the magic of dragons. Others carry a raw, uncontrolled magic within them, a chaotic storm that manifests in unexpected ways.": "魔法是每个巫师的一部分，它使身体、思想和精神充满了潜在的力量，等待着被挖掘。一些巫师挥舞着来自古老血脉的魔法，其中注入了龙的魔力。其他巫师则携带着一种原始的、不受控制的魔法，一种以意想不到的方式表现出来的混乱的风暴。",
	"The appearance of sorcerous powers is wildly unpredictable. Some draconic bloodlines produce exactly one sorcerer in every generation, but in other lines of descent every individual is a sorcerer. Most of the time, the talents of sorcery appear as apparent flukes. Some sorcerers can't name the origin of their power, while others trace it to strange events in their own lives. The touch of a demon, the blessing of a dryad at a baby's birth, or a taste of the water from a mysterious spring might spark the gift of sorcery. So too might the gift of a deity of magic, exposure to the elemental forces of the Inner Planes or the maddening chaos of Limbo, or a glimpse into the inner workings of reality.": "巫术力量的出现是非常难以预测的。一些龙人血统每一代都会产生一个巫师，但在其他血统中，每个人都是巫师。大多数时候，巫术的天赋是以明显的侥幸心理出现的。一些巫师无法说出他们力量的来源，而其他巫师则将其追溯到他们自己生活中的奇怪事件。恶魔的触摸，婴儿出生时干尸的祝福，或者尝到神秘泉水的味道，都可能激发出巫术的天赋。魔法之神的恩赐、接触到内部星球的元素力量或Limbo的疯狂混乱，或者瞥见现实的内部运作，也都可能激发巫术的天赋。",
	"Sorcerers have no use for the spellbooks and ancient tomes of magic lore that wizards rely on, nor do they rely on a patron to grant their spells as warlocks do. By learning to harness and channel their own inborn magic, they can discover new and staggering ways to unleash that power.": "巫师不需要巫师所依赖的法术书和古老的魔法传说书，他们也不像术士那样依赖赞助人授予他们法术。通过学习驾驭和引导自己与生俱来的魔力，他们可以发现新的、令人震惊的方法来释放这种力量。",
	"Sorcerers are rare in the world, and it's unusual to find a sorcerer who is not involved in the adventuring life in some way. People with magical power seething in their veins soon discover that the power doesn't like to stay quiet. A sorcerer's magic wants to be wielded, and it has a tendency to spill out in unpredictable ways if it isn't called on.": "巫师在这个世界上是很罕见的，不以某种方式参与冒险生活的巫师是不常见的。血管里涌动着魔法力量的人很快就会发现，这种力量并不喜欢保持安静。巫师的魔法想要被挥舞，如果不被召唤，它就会以不可预知的方式溢出来。",
	"Sorcerers often have obscure or quixotic motivations driving them to adventure. Some seek a greater understanding of the magical force that infuses them, or the answer to the mystery of its origin. Others hope to find a way to get rid of it, or to unleash its full potential. Whatever their goals, sorcerers are every bit as useful to an adventuring party as wizards, making up for a comparative lack of breadth in their magical knowledge with enormous flexibility in using the spells they know.": "巫师们往往有晦涩难懂的动机，促使他们去冒险。有些人寻求对注入他们体内的魔法力量有更多的了解，或对其起源之谜的答案。其他人则希望找到摆脱它的方法，或释放其全部潜力。无论他们的目标是什么，巫师对冒险队伍来说都和巫师一样有用，他们在使用他们所知道的法术时具有巨大的灵活性，从而弥补了他们在魔法知识方面相对缺乏的广度。",
	"The most important question to consider when creating your sorcerer is the origin of your power. As a starting character, you'll choose an origin that ties to a draconic bloodline or the influence of wild magic, but the exact source of your power is up to you to decide. Is it a family curse, passed down to you from distant ancestors? Or did some extraordinary event leave you blessed with inherent magic but perhaps scarred as well?": "在创建你的巫师时要考虑的最重要的问题是你的力量的来源。作为一个起始角色，你将选择一个与龙人血统或野生魔法的影响有关的起源，但你力量的确切来源由你决定。它是一个家族的诅咒，从遥远的祖先传给你的？还是某些特殊事件让你受到固有魔法的祝福，但也许也留下了伤痕？",
	"How do you feel about the magical power coursing through you? Do you embrace it, try to master it, or revel in its unpredictable nature? Is it a blessing or a curse? Did you seek it out, or did it find you? Did you have the option to refuse it, and do you wish you had? What do you intend to do with it? Perhaps you feel like you've been given this power for some lofty purpose. Or you might decide that the power gives you the right to do what you want, to take what you want from those who lack such power. Perhaps your power links you to a powerful individual in the world—the fey creature that blessed you at birth, the dragon who put a drop of its blood into your veins, the lich who created you as an experiment, or the deity who chose you to carry this power.": "你对流经你体内的神奇力量有什么感觉？你是拥抱它，试图掌握它，还是陶醉于它不可预测的性质？它是一种祝福还是一种诅咒？是你寻找它，还是它找到你？你是否可以选择拒绝它，你是否希望你能拒绝它？你打算用它做什么？也许你觉得你被赋予这种力量是为了某种崇高的目的。或者你可能决定，这种权力给了你做你想做的事情的权利，从那些缺乏这种权力的人那里夺取你想要的东西。也许你的力量将你与世界上某个强大的个体联系在一起--在你出生时祝福你的精灵生物，将它的一滴血注入你血管的龙，创造你作为实验品的巫师，或者选择你携带这种力量的神灵。",
	"You can make a sorcerer quickly by following these suggestions. First, Charisma should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose the hermit background. Third, choose the {@spell light}, {@spell prestidigitation}, {@spell ray of frost}, and {@spell shocking grasp} cantrips, along with the 1st-level spells {@spell shield} and {@spell magic missile}.": "按照这些建议，你可以迅速成为一名巫师。首先，魅力应该是你最高的能力得分，其次是体质。第二，选择隐士的背景。第三，选择{@spell light}、{@spell prestidigitation}、{@spell ray of frost}和{@spell shocking grasp}的咒语，以及一级法术{@spell shield}和{@spell magic missile}。",
	"Practice and study are for amateurs. True power is a birthright.": "练习和学习是为业余爱好者准备的。真正的力量是与生俱来的。",
	"When it comes to drawing forth their abilities in times of need, sorcerers have it easy compared to other characters. Their power not only rests within them, but it likely takes some effort to keep it at bay. Every sorcerer is born to the role, or stumbles into it through cosmic chance. Unlike other characters, who must actively learn, embrace, and pursue their talents, sorcerers have their power thrust upon them.": "说到在需要的时候发挥他们的能力，与其他角色相比，巫师们很容易。他们的力量不仅存在于他们体内，而且可能需要一些努力来保持它。每个巫师都是为这个角色而生的，或者是通过宇宙的机会偶然进入这个角色。与其他角色不同的是，巫师必须主动学习、接受和追求他们的天赋，而他们的力量是被推到他们身上的。",
	"Because the idea of an innately magical being traveling among them does not sit well with many folk, sorcerers tend to breed mistrust and suspicion in others they come across. Nonetheless, many sorcerers succeed in overcoming that prejudice through deeds that benefit their less magically gifted contemporaries.": "因为很多人对一个天生有魔法的人在他们中间旅行的想法不以为然，所以巫师们往往会对他们遇到的其他人产生不信任和猜疑。尽管如此，许多巫师通过有利于他们那些魔法天赋较低的同龄人的行为，成功地克服了这种偏见。",
	"Sorcerers are often defined by the events surrounding the manifestation of their power. For those who receive it as an expected birthright, its appearance is a cause for celebration. Other sorcerers are treated as outcasts, banished from their homes after the sudden, terrifying arrival of their abilities.": "巫师通常是由围绕着他们的力量的显现而发生的事件来定义的。对于那些将其作为一种预期的天生权利的人来说，其出现是一个值得庆祝的理由。其他巫师则被视为弃儿，在他们的能力突然出现后被逐出家门，令人恐惧。",
	"Playing a sorcerer character can be as rewarding as it is challenging. The sections below offer suggestions on how to flesh out and personalize your persona.": "扮演一个巫师角色既能带来回报，又能带来挑战。下面的章节提供了关于如何充实和个性化你的角色的建议。",
	"Some sorcerers understand where their power came from, based on how their abilities manifested. Others can only speculate, since their powers came to them in a way that suggests no particular cause.": "一些巫师明白他们的力量来自哪里，基于他们的能力是如何表现出来的。其他人只能猜测，因为他们的能力是以一种没有特定原因的方式出现的。",
	"Does your character know the source of your magical power? Does it tie back to some distant relative, a cosmic event, or blind chance? If your sorcerer doesn't know where their power arose from, your DM can use this table (or select an origin) and reveal it to you when the information plays a role in the campaign.": "你的角色知道你的魔法力量的来源吗？它是否与某个遥远的亲戚、某个宇宙事件或盲目的机会有关？如果你的巫师不知道他们的力量从何而来，你的DM可以使用这个表格（或选择一个来源），并在信息在活动中起作用时向你揭示它。",
	"Your power arises from your family's bloodline. You are related to some powerful creature, or you inherited a blessing or a curse.": "你的力量来自你的家族血脉。你与一些强大的生物有关系，或者你继承了一种祝福或诅咒。",

	"When a new sorcerer enters the world, either at birth or later when one's power becomes evident, the consequences of that event depend greatly on how its witnesses react to what they have seen.": "当一个新的巫师进入这个世界时，无论是在出生时还是后来当一个人的力量变得明显时，这一事件的后果在很大程度上取决于其证人对他们所看到的东西的反应。",
	"When your sorcerer's powers appeared, how did the world around you respond? Were other people supportive, fearful, or somewhere in between?": "当你的巫师的力量出现时，你周围的世界是如何反应的？其他人是支持、恐惧，还是介于两者之间？",

	"Your powers are believed to be tied to an ancient line of mad kings that supposedly ended in a bloody revolt over a century ago.": "你的力量被认为与一个古老的疯狂国王家族有关，据说在一个多世纪前的血腥叛乱中结束。",
	"A sorcerer at rest is almost indistinguishable from a normal person; it's only when their magic flies forth that sorcerers reveal their true nature. Even so, many sorcerers have a subtle but telling physical trait that sets them apart from other folk.": "巫师在休息时几乎与普通人无异；只有当他们的魔法飞出时，巫师才会暴露出他们的真实本性。即便如此，许多巫师都有一个微妙但能说明问题的身体特征，使他们有别于其他民族。",
	"If your sorcerer has a supernatural mark, it might be one that's easily concealed, or it could be a source of pride that you keep on constant display.": "如果你的巫师有一个超自然的标记，它可能是一个很容易隐藏的标记，或者它可能是你不断展示的骄傲的来源。",

	"A red splotch appears on your neck once a day, then vanishes after an hour.": "每天在脖子上出现一次红色斑点，然后在一小时后消失。",
	"As the world well knows, some sorcerers are better than others at controlling their spellcasting. Sometimes a wild display of magic gone awry emanates from a sorcerer who casts a spell. But even when one's magic goes off as planned, the act of casting is often accompanied by a telltale sign that makes it clear where that magical energy came from.": "世人皆知，有些巫师比其他巫师更善于控制他们的施法。有时，从施法的巫师身上会传出魔法出错的疯狂表现。但是，即使一个人的魔法按计划进行，施法行为也往往伴随着一个提示性的标志，使人清楚地了解魔法能量的来源。",
