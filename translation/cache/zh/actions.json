	"Activating some magic items requires a user to do something in particular, such as holding the item and uttering a command word, reading the item if it is a scroll, or drinking it if it is a potion. The description of each item category or individual item details how an item is activated. Certain items use one or more of the following rules related to their activation.": "激活一些魔法物品需要使用者做一些特别的事情，比如拿着物品并说出一个命令词，如果是卷轴，则阅读该物品，如果是药水，则饮用该物品。每个物品类别或单个物品的描述都详细说明了物品如何被激活。某些物品使用了一个或多个与它们的激活有关的规则。",
	"If an item requires an action to activate, that action isn't a function of the {@action Use an Object} action, so a feature such as the rogue's {@subclassFeature Fast Hands|Rogue||Thief||3} can't be used to activate the item.": "如果一个物品需要一个动作来激活，这个动作不是{@action Use an Object}动作的功能，所以像流氓的{@subclassFeature Fast Hands|Rogue||Thief||3}这样的功能不能用来激活这个物品。",
	"A command word is a word or phrase that must be spoken audibly for the item to operate. A magic item that requires the user to speak a command word can't be activated in the area of any effect that prevents sound, such as the area created by the silence spell.": "命令词是一个必须以声音说出的单词或短语，以便物品能够运作。一个需要使用者说出命令词的魔法物品不能在任何阻止声音的效果区域内被激活，比如沉默咒语所创造的区域。",
	"Some items are used up when they are activated. A potion or elixir must be swallowed, or an oil applied to the body. The writing vanishes from a scroll when it is read. Once used, a consumable item loses its magic and no longer functions.": "有些物品在被激活后会被用掉。药水或灵药必须吞下，或将油涂在身上。卷轴上的文字在被阅读后会消失。消耗品一旦使用，就会失去其魔力，不再起作用。",
	"Some magic items allow the user to cast a spell from the item, often by expending charges from it. The spell is cast at the lowest possible spell and caster level, doesn't expend any of the user's spell slots, and requires no components unless the item's description says otherwise. The spell uses its normal casting time, range, and duration, and the user of the item must concentrate if the spell requires concentration. Certain items make exceptions to these rules, changing the casting time, duration, or other parts of a spell.": "一些魔法物品允许使用者从该物品中施放法术，通常是通过消耗它的费用。该法术以最低的法术和施法者等级施放，不消耗使用者的任何法术槽，并且不需要任何组件，除非该物品的描述另有说明。该法术使用其正常的施法时间、范围和持续时间，如果该法术需要集中注意力，则该物品的使用者必须集中注意力。某些物品对这些规则做了例外处理，改变了施法时间、持续时间或法术的其他部分。",
	"Many items, such as potions, bypass the casting of the spell and confer the spell's effects. Such an item still uses the spell's duration unless the item's description says otherwise.": "许多物品，例如药水，绕过了施法，并赋予了法术的效果。这样的物品仍然使用法术的持续时间，除非该物品的描述另有说明。",
	"A magic item, such as certain staffs, may require you to use your own spellcasting ability when you cast a spell from the item. If you have more than one spellcasting ability, you choose which one to use with the item. If you don't have a spellcasting ability—perhaps you're a rogue with the Use Magic Device feature—your spellcasting ability modifier is +0 for the item, and your proficiency bonus does apply.": "一个魔法物品，比如某些法杖，可能需要你在用该物品施法时使用你自己的施法能力。如果你有一个以上的法术能力，你可以选择哪一个来使用该物品。如果你没有法术能力--也许你是一个拥有使用魔法装置功能的流氓--你的法术能力修改器对该物品来说是+0，而你的熟练度加成则适用。",
	"Some magic items have charges that you expend to activate its properties. The number of charges an item has remaining is revealed when an identify spell is cast on the item, or when a creature attunes to the item. Additionally, when an item regains charges, the creature attuned to that item learns how many charges it regained.": "有些魔法物品有费用，你需要花费费用来激活它的属性。当对物品施展识别法术时，或者当一个生物与物品相适应时，物品剩余的电荷数会被显示。此外，当一个物品重新获得电荷时，与该物品相适应的生物会了解它重新获得了多少电荷。",
	"The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.": "战斗中最常见的动作是攻击动作，无论你是挥舞着剑，用弓射箭，还是用拳头斗殴。",
	"With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the \"{@book Making an Attack|phb|9|making an attack}\" section for the rules that govern attacks.": "通过这个动作，你可以进行一次近战或远程攻击。请参阅\"{@book Making an Attack|phb|9|making an attack} \"部分，了解有关攻击的规则。",

	"Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell. See {@book chapter 10|phb|10|casting a spell} for the rules on spellcasting.": "巫师和牧师等施法者，以及许多怪物，都可以使用法术，并能在战斗中使用它们取得巨大效果。每个法术都有一个施法时间，它规定了施法者是否必须使用一个动作、一个反应、几分钟、甚至几小时来施法。因此，施展法术不一定是行动。大多数法术的施法时间确实是1个行动，所以施法者经常在战斗中使用他或她的行动来施放这样的法术。关于施法的规则见（%0%）。",
	"If one creature wants to jump onto another creature, it can do so by {@action grapple||grappling}. A small or Medium creature has little chance of making a successful grapple against a Huge or Gargantuan creature, however, unless magic has granted the grappler supernatural might.": "如果一个生物想跳到另一个生物身上，它可以这样做（%0%）。然而，一个小型或中型生物几乎没有机会成功抓捕一个巨大或巨型生物，除非魔法赋予抓捕者超自然的力量。",
	"As an alternative, a suitably large opponent can be treated as terrain for the purpose of jumping onto its back or clinging to a limb. After making any ability checks necessary to get into position and onto the larger creature, the smaller creature uses its action to make a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) or Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check contested by the target's Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check. If it wins the contest, the smaller creature successfully moves into the target creature's space, the smaller creature moves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls against it.": "作为一种选择，一个适当大的对手可以被视为地形，以便跳到它的背上或依附于一个肢体。在进行任何必要的能力检查以进入位置并爬上较大的生物之后，较小的生物使用它的行动来进行力量（（%0%））或灵巧（（%1%））检查，并与目标的灵巧（（%2%））检查进行竞争。如果它赢得了比赛，较小的生物就成功地移动到目标生物的空间，较小的生物就会与目标一起移动，并且在对它的攻击卷上有优势。",
	"The smaller creature can move around within the larger creature's space, treating the space as difficult terrain. The larger creature's ability to attack the smaller creature depends on the smaller creature's location, and is left to your discretion. The larger creature can dislodge the smaller creature as an action—knocking it off, scraping it against a wall, or grabbing and throwing it—by making a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check contested by the smaller creature's Strength ({@skill Athletics}) or Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check. The smaller creature chooses which ability to use.": "较小的生物可以在较大的生物的空间内移动，将该空间视为困难地形。大型生物攻击小型生物的能力取决于小型生物的位置，并由你决定。较大的生物可以通过对较小的生物的力量（{@skill Athletics}）进行检查，并通过对较小的生物的力量（{@skill Athletics}）或灵巧（{@skill Acrobatics}）进行检查，将较小的生物赶走作为一个动作--将它推开，将它刮到墙上，或者抓住并扔出去。较小的生物可以选择使用哪种能力。",
	"When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.": "当你采取冲刺行动时，你在当前回合获得额外的移动。增加的幅度等于你的速度，在应用了任何修饰因素之后。例如，如果你的速度是30英尺，你可以在你的回合中移动到60英尺。",
	"Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.": "对你的速度的任何增加或减少都会以相同的数量改变这种额外的移动。例如，如果你的速度从30英尺降低到15英尺，那么如果你冲刺的话，本回合你最多可以移动30英尺。",
	"A creature can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon or another item from a target's grasp. The attacker makes an attack roll contested by the target's Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check or Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check. If the attacker wins the contest, the attack causes no damage or other ill effect, but the defender drops the item.": "一个生物可以使用武器攻击，将武器或其他物品从目标手中击落。攻击者在目标的力量（（%0%））检查或灵巧（（%1%））检查中进行攻击卷的争夺。如果攻击者赢得比赛，攻击不会造成伤害或其他不良影响，但防御者会掉落物品。",
	"The attacker has disadvantage on its attack roll if the target is holding the item with two or more hands. The target has advantage on its ability check if it is larger than the attacking creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller.": "如果目标用两只或更多的手拿着该物品，则攻击者在其攻击卷中处于劣势。如果目标比攻击者大，它的能力检查就有优势，如果它小，就有劣势。",
	"If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.": "如果你采取脱离行动，你的行动在回合的剩余时间内不会引起机会攻击。",
	"When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are incapacitated (as explained in the appendix) or if your speed drops to 0.": "当你采取躲避动作时，你完全专注于躲避攻击。在你下一回合开始之前，如果你能看到攻击者，任何针对你的攻击卷都是不利的，而你做灵巧救赎则是有利的。如果你丧失了能力（如附录中所解释的）或者你的速度下降到0，你就会失去这个好处。",
	"The time it takes to don or doff armor {@table Getting Into and Out of Armor; Donning and Doffing Armor|phb|depends on the armor's category}. A {@item shield|phb} can be donned or doffed as an action.": "穿戴或脱掉盔甲所需的时间（%0%）。一个{@item shield|phb}可以作为一个动作穿戴或脱下。",
	"If a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).": "如果一个法术必须用集中力来维持，这个事实就会出现在它的持续时间条目中，并且法术规定了你可以集中精力在它身上多长时间。你可以在任何时候结束专注（不需要行动）。",

To do so, it must succeed on a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) or Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check contested by your Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check.": "一个{@condition grappled}的生物可以用它的行动来逃跑。要做到这一点，它必须在你的力量（%1%）或灵巧（%2%）的检查中成功，并与你的力量（%3%）检查相抗衡。",
	"When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the {@action Attack} action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the {@action Attack} action, this attack replaces one of them. The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach.": "当你想抓住一个生物或与之搏斗时，你可以使用{@action Attack}动作来进行一次特殊的近战攻击，即抓捕。如果你能用{@action Attack}动作进行多次攻击，这个攻击可以代替其中一次。你抓捕的目标必须不比你大一号，而且必须在你的范围之内。",
	"Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check, a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check contested by the target's Strength ({@skill Athletics}) or Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check (the target chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is {@condition incapacitated}. If you succeed, you subject the target to the {@condition grappled} condition (see the appendix). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).": "你至少使用一只自由的手，试图通过进行抓取检查来抓住目标，这是一个由目标的力量（（%0%））检查或灵巧（（%2%））检查（目标选择使用的能力）来争夺。如果目标是（%3%），你自动成功。如果你成功了，你使目标受到{@condition grappled}的条件限制（见附录）。该条件规定了结束它的事情，你可以随时释放目标（不需要行动）。",

	"As an action, a character can use a healing surge and spend up to half his or her Hit Dice. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character's Constitution modifier. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll.": "作为一个行动，一个角色可以使用一个治疗突增，并花费他或她的一半命中率。以这种方式花掉的每一个命中率骰子，玩家都会掷骰子并加上角色的体质修正值。该角色恢复的命中率与总数相等。玩家可以决定在每次掷骰子后再花一个额外的命中率。",
	"A character who uses a healing surge can't do so again until he or she finishes a short or long rest. Under this optional rule, a character regains all spent Hit Dice at the end of a long rest. With a short rest, a character regains Hit Dice equal to his or her level divided by four (minimum of one dice).": "一个使用了治疗激增的角色在完成短期或长期休息之前不能再这样做。在这个可选的规则下，一个角色在长时间休息结束后会恢复所有已消耗的生命值。短暂休息时，角色恢复的命中率等于他或她的等级除以四（最少一个骰子）。",

When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.": "你可以在完成一项任务时向另一个生物提供帮助。当你采取帮助行动时，你所帮助的生物在它为执行你所帮助的任务而进行的下一次能力检查中获得优势，只要它在你下一回合开始前进行检查。",
	"Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally's attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.": "或者，你可以帮助一个友好的生物攻击你周围5英尺内的生物。你进行佯攻，分散目标的注意力，或者以其他方式组队，使你的盟友的攻击更加有效。如果你的盟友在你的下一个回合之前攻击目标，那么第一次攻击卷轴是以优势进行的。",
	"When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules in {@book chapter 7 |phb|7|hiding} for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the \"{@book Unseen Attackers and Targets|PHB|9|unseen attackers and targets}\" section in the Player's Handbook.": "当你采取隐藏行动时，你要进行一次灵巧（（%0%））检查，试图隐藏起来，遵循（%1%）中关于隐藏的规则。如果你成功了，你会获得某些好处，如《玩家手册》中的\"{@book Unseen Attackers and Targets|PHB|9|unseen attackers and targets} \"部分所述。",
	"Sometimes a character wants to identify a spell that someone else is casting or that was already cast. To do so, a character can use their reaction to identify a spell as it's being cast, or they can use an action on their turn to identify a spell by its effect after it is cast.": "有时，一个角色想识别别人正在施放的或已经施放的法术。要做到这一点，角色可以使用他们的反应来识别正在施放的咒语，或者他们可以在他们的回合中使用行动来识别施放后的咒语效果。",
	"If the character perceived the casting, the spell's effect, or both, the character can make an Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check with the reaction or action. The DC equals 15 + the spell's level. If the spell is cast as a class spell and the character is a member of that class, the check is made with advantage. For example, if the spellcaster casts a spell as a cleric, another cleric has advantage on the check to identify the spell. Some spells aren't associated with any class when they're cast, such as when a monster uses its Innate Spellcasting trait.": "如果角色察觉到了施法、咒语的效果，或者两者都察觉到了，角色可以用反应或行动进行智力（（%0%））检查。DC等于15+法术的等级。如果该法术是作为类法术施放的，并且该角色是该类的成员，那么该检查是有优势的。例如，如果施法者以牧师身份施法，那么另一个牧师在识别该法术的检定中具有优势。有些法术在施放时并不与任何类别相关联，例如当一个怪物使用其天生的法术特性时。",
	"This Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check represents the fact that identifying a spell requires a quick mind and familiarity with the theory and practice of casting. This is true even for a character whose spellcasting ability is Wisdom or Charisma. Being able to cast spells doesn't by itself make you adept at deducing exactly what others are doing when they cast their spells.": "这个智力（（%0%））检查代表了这样一个事实：识别一个咒语需要一个快速的头脑和对施法的理论和实践的熟悉。即使对于一个施法能力为智慧或魅力的角色来说也是如此。能够施法本身并不能使你善于推断出别人施法时到底在做什么。",
	"Your character can do things not covered by the actions in this chapter, such as breaking down doors, intimidating enemies, sensing weaknesses in magical defenses, or calling for a parley with a foe.

	"When a creature makes a melee attack, it can also mark its target. Until the end of the attacker's next turn, any opportunity attack it makes against the marked target has advantage. The opportunity attack doesn't expend the attacker's reaction, but the attacker can't make the attack if anything, such as the {@condition incapacitated} condition or the {@spell shocking grasp} spell, is preventing it from taking reactions. The attacker is limited to one opportunity attack per turn.": "当一个生物进行近战攻击时，它也可以标记其目标。直到攻击者的下一回合结束，它对被标记的目标所做的任何机会攻击都有优势。机会攻击不会消耗攻击者的反应，但是如果有什么东西，例如{@condition incapacitated}条件或{@spell shocking grasp}咒语，阻止它做出反应的话，攻击者就不能做出攻击。攻击者每回合只能进行一次机会攻击。",
	"In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for enemies to drop their guard. You can rarely move heedlessly past your foes without putting yourself in danger; doing so provokes an opportunity attack.": "在战斗中，每个人都在不断观察敌人是否会放松警惕。你很少能漫不经心地从你的敌人身边走过而不使自己处于危险之中；这样做会引起机会攻击。",
	"You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature.

	"You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the {@action Disengage} action. You also don't provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction.

	"A creature can try to tumble through a hostile creature's space, ducking and weaving past the opponent. As an action or a bonus action, the tumbler makes a Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check contested by the hostile creature's Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check. If the tumbler wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space once this turn.": "一个生物可以尝试翻滚通过一个敌对生物的空间，躲避和穿梭过对手。作为一个行动或额外行动，翻滚者做一个灵巧（{@skill Acrobatics}）检查，与敌对生物的灵巧（{@skill Acrobatics}）检查竞争。如果翻滚者赢得比赛，它可以在本回合内通过敌对生物的空间移动一次。",
	"When you take the {@action Attack} action and attack with a light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.": "当你采取{@action Attack}行动，用你一只手拿着的轻型近战武器进行攻击时，你可以使用一个额外行动，用你另一只手拿着的不同轻型近战武器进行攻击。你不会把你的能力修饰值加到额外攻击的伤害上，除非该修饰值是负的。",

	"You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.": "你通常在做其他事情的时候与一个物体互动，例如当你拔出一把剑作为攻击的一部分。当一个物体的使用需要你的行动时，你就采取使用一个物体的行动。当你想在你的回合中与一个以上的物体互动时，这个动作也很有用。",
	"A creature that is naturally sleeping, as opposed to being in a magically or chemically induced sleep, wakes up if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake or slap the creature awake. A sudden loud noise—such as yelling, thunder, or a ringing bell—also awakens someone that is sleeping naturally.": "一个自然睡眠的生物，而不是处于魔法或化学诱导的睡眠中，如果它受到任何伤害，或者如果其他人使用动作摇晃或拍打该生物，就会醒来。突如其来的巨响--比如大喊大叫、打雷或响铃--也会唤醒自然睡眠的人。",
	"Whispers don't disturb sleep, unless a sleeper's passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score is 20 or higher and the whispers are within 10 feet of the sleeper.

	"The smaller creature can move around within the larger creature's space, treating the space as {@quickref difficult terrain||3}. The larger creature's ability to attack the smaller creature depends on the smaller creature's location, and is left to your discretion. The larger creature can dislodge the smaller creature as an action—knocking it off, scraping it against a wall, or grabbing and throwing it—by making a Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check contested by the smaller creature's Strength ({@skill Athletics}) or Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check. The smaller creature chooses which ability to use.": "较小的生物可以在较大的生物的空间内移动，将该空间视为（%0%）。大型生物攻击小型生物的能力取决于小型生物的位置，并由你决定。较大的生物可以通过对较小的生物的力量（{@skill Athletics}）进行检查，并通过对较小的生物的力量（{@skill Athletics}）或灵巧（{@skill Acrobatics}）进行检查，将较小的生物移开，作为一个动作--将其推开，将其刮到墙上，或抓住并扔出去。较小的生物可以选择使用哪种能力。"
