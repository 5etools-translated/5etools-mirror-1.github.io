	"The Dungeons & Dragons Roleplaying Game is about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery. Like games of make-believe, D&D is driven by imagination. It's about picturing a crumbling castle in a darkening forest and imagining how a fantasy adventurer might react to the challenges that scene presents. In this fantasy world, the possibilities are limitless.": "龙与地下城角色扮演游戏是关于在剑与魔法的世界里讲故事的。与虚构的游戏一样，D&D是由想象力驱动的。它是关于在黑暗的森林中想象一座摇摇欲坠的城堡，并想象一个幻想中的冒险家会如何应对这个场景带来的挑战。在这个幻想的世界里，可能性是无限的。",

	"Dungeon Master (DM): The castle stands among the trees, the crumbling ruins of seven round towers jutting up from it like broken teeth. An archway littered with twisted shards of rusted metal gapes open at the top of a short flight of steps. Two of the towers, speckled with dark arrow slits, loom beside the entryway, and a dark hall yawns beyond.": "地下城管理员（DM）。城堡矗立在树丛中，七座圆塔的残垣断壁像断了线的牙齿一样从它上面伸出来。一条拱门上堆满了扭曲的生锈金属碎片，在短短的台阶顶端裂开。其中两座塔楼在入口处旁若隐若现，上面布满了黑暗的箭缝，一个黑暗的大厅在外面打着哈欠。",

	"Unlike a game of make-believe, D&D gives structure to the stories—a way of determining the consequences of the adventurers' actions. Players roll dice to determine whether their attacks hit or miss and whether their characters can scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a magical lightning bolt, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything is possible, but the dice make some things more probable than others.": "与虚构的游戏不同，D&D为故事提供了结构--确定冒险者行动后果的方法。玩家通过掷骰子来决定他们的攻击是否命中，以及他们的角色是否能爬上悬崖，滚开魔法闪电的攻击，或完成其他一些危险的任务。任何事情都是可能的，但骰子使一些事情比其他事情更有可能发生。",

	"When you play D&D, you take on the role of an adventurer: a skilled fighter, a devout cleric, a deadly rogue, or a spellcasting wizard.

	"One player takes on the role of the Dungeon Master, the game's lead storyteller and referee. The DM is in charge of the adventure, which appears in the adventure book, while the characters navigate the adventure's hazards and decide where to explore. The DM might describe the entrance to a ruined castle, and the players decide what they want their adventurers to do. Will they boldly stride up to the fallen gate, or try to sneak up in case anyone's watching through those arrow slits? Circle around the castle looking for another entrance? Or cast a spell to cloak themselves in invisibility?": "一个玩家扮演地下城主的角色，他是游戏的主要讲故事者和裁判员。DM负责冒险，出现在冒险书中，而角色们则在冒险的危险中穿梭，并决定去哪里探索。DM可能会描述一个废墟城堡的入口，而玩家则决定他们希望他们的冒险者做什么。他们会大胆地走到倒塌的大门前，还是试着偷偷地走过去，以防有人从那些箭缝中看到？绕着城堡寻找另一个入口？还是施展法术让自己隐身？",
