	"Beneath the bustling City of Waterdeep, a beholder crime lord keeps tabs on everyone and everything—or so the beholder thinks. Known as Xanathar, this bizarre being believes it can gather information on everything in the Dungeons & Dragons multiverse. The beholder desires to know it all! But no matter what the beholder learns and what treasures it acquires, its most prized possession in all the multiverse remains its goldfish, Sylgar.": "在繁华的沃特迪普城下，有一个beholder犯罪头目在监视着每一个人和每一件事--或者说beholder认为是这样。这个被称为 \"Xanathar \"的怪异生物认为它可以收集龙与地下城多元宇宙中的一切信息。观察者渴望了解这一切！但无论观察者了解到什么，他都不知道。但是，无论这个人学到了什么，获得了什么宝藏，它在整个多元宇宙中最珍贵的财产仍然是它的金鱼，希尔加。",
	"The first major rules expansion to the fifth edition of D&D, {@i Xanathar's Guide to Everything} provides a wealth of new options for the game. Xanathar might not be able to realize its dream to know everything, but this book does delve into every major part of the game: adventurers, their adventures, and the magic they wield.": "第五版D&D的第一个主要规则扩展，{@i Xanathar's Guide to Everything}为游戏提供了大量的新选择。Xanathar可能无法实现其了解一切的梦想，但这本书确实深入研究了游戏的每一个主要部分：冒险者、他们的冒险以及他们挥舞的魔法。",
	"Written for both players and Dungeon Masters, this book offers options to enhance campaigns in any world, whether you're adventuring in the Forgotten Realms, another official D&D setting, or a world of your own creation. The options here build on the official rules contained within the player's handbook, the monster manual, and the dungeon master's guide. Think of this book as the companion to those volumes. It builds on their foundation, exploring pathways first laid in those publications. Nothing herein is required for a D&D campaign—this is not a fourth core rulebook—but we hope it will provide you new ways to enjoy the game.": "本书为玩家和地下城主编写，提供了在任何世界中增强战役的选项，无论你是在被遗忘的领域、另一个官方的D&D设定中冒险，还是在你自己创造的世界。这里的选项建立在玩家手册、怪物手册和地下城主指南中的官方规则之上。把这本书看作是这些书的伴侣。它建立在它们的基础上，探索那些出版物中首次提出的途径。本书中没有任何内容是D&D活动所必需的--这不是第四本核心规则书，但我们希望它能为你提供享受游戏的新方法。",
	"Chapter 1 offers character options that expand on those offered in the player's handbook. Chapter 2 is a toolkit for the DM that provides new resources for running the game and designing adventures, all of it building on the Monster Manual and the Dungeon Master's Guide. Chapter 3 presents new spells for player characters and spellcasting monsters to unleash.": "第1章提供了在玩家手册中所提供的角色选项的扩展。第2章是DM的工具包，提供了运行游戏和设计冒险的新资源，所有这些都建立在《怪物手册》和《地牢管理员指南》的基础上。第三章为玩家角色和施法怪物提供了新的法术，供其释放。",
	"Appendix A provides guidance on running a shared campaign, similar to the activities staged by the D&D Adventurers League, and appendix B contains a host of tables that allow you to quickly generate names for the characters in your D&D stories.": "附录A提供了关于开展共享活动的指导，类似于D&D冒险者联盟举办的活动，附录B包含了大量的表格，允许你快速为D&D故事中的人物生成名字。",
	"As you peruse the many options herein, you'll come across observations from Xanathar itself. Like the beholder's roving mind, your reading will take you to places in the game familiar and new. May you enjoy the journey!": "当你浏览这里的许多选项时，你会遇到来自Xanathar本身的观察。就像观察者的漫游思维一样，你的阅读将把你带到游戏中熟悉和新的地方。愿你享受这段旅程!",
	"Much of the material in this book originally appeared in Unearthed Arcana, a series of online articles we publish to explore rules that might officially become part of the game. Some Unearthed Arcana offerings don't end up resonating with fans and are set aside for the time being. The Unearthed Arcana material that inspired the options in the following chapters was well received and, thanks to feedback from thousands of you, has been refined into the official forms presented here.": "本书中的许多材料最初出现在《未解之谜》中，这是我们为探索可能正式成为游戏一部分的规则而发布的一系列在线文章。有些 \"未出之谜 \"的内容最终没有引起粉丝的共鸣，因此暂时被搁置。激发以下各章选项的 \"未知的阿卡纳 \"材料广受好评，并且由于你们成千上万人的反馈，已经被完善为这里的正式形式。",
	"This book relies on the rules in the three core rulebooks. The game especially makes frequent use of the rules in chapters 7-10 of the player's handbook: \"Using Ability Scores,\" \"Adventuring,\" \"Combat,\" and \"Spellcasting.\" That book's appendix A is also crucial; it contains definitions of conditions, like {@condition invisible} and {@condition prone}. You don't need to know the rules by heart, but it's helpful to know where to find them when you need them.": "本书依赖于三本核心规则书中的规则。游戏尤其频繁地使用了玩家手册第7-10章中的规则。\"使用能力值\"、\"冒险\"、\"战斗 \"和 \"法术\"。那本书的附录A也很关键；它包含了条件的定义，如（%0%）和（%1%）。你不需要熟记这些规则，但当你需要它们时，知道在哪里可以找到它们是很有帮助的。",
	"If you're a DM, you should also know where to look things up in the dungeon master's guide, especially the rules on how magic items work (see chapter 7 of that book). The introduction of the monster manual is your guide on how to use a monster's stat block.": "如果你是一个DM，你也应该知道在哪里可以查到地下城主指南中的东西，特别是关于魔法物品如何工作的规则（见该书第7章）。怪物手册的介绍是你关于如何使用怪物的状态块的指南。",
	"One rule overrides all others: the DM is the final authority on how the rules work in play.": "有一条规则凌驾于所有其他规则之上：DM是游戏中规则如何运作的最终权威。",
	"Rules are part of what makes D&D a game, rather than just improvised storytelling. The game's rules are meant to help organize, and even inspire, the action of a D&D campaign. The rules are a tool, and we want our tools to be as effective as possible. No matter how good those tools might be, they need a group of players to bring them to life and a DM to guide their use.": "规则是D&D之所以成为游戏的一部分，而不仅仅是即兴的故事。游戏规则的目的是帮助组织，甚至激发D&D活动的行动。规则是一种工具，而我们希望我们的工具尽可能地有效。无论这些工具有多好，它们都需要一群玩家将其带入生活，并需要一个DM来指导其使用。",
	"The DM is key. Many unexpected events can occur in a D&D campaign, and no set of rules could reasonably account for every contingency. If the rules tried to do so, the game would become a slog. An alternative would be for the rules to severely limit what characters can do, which would be contrary to the open-endedness of D&D. Here's the path the game takes: it lays a foundation of rules that a DM can build on, and it embraces the DM's role as the bridge between the things the rules address and the things they don't.": "管理者是关键。在D&D活动中，可能会发生许多意想不到的事件，没有一套规则能够合理地考虑到每一个突发事件。如果规则试图这样做，游戏就会变得很费劲。另一种选择是，规则严格限制角色的行为，这与D&D的开放性相悖。这就是游戏所走的道路：它奠定了规则的基础，DM可以在此基础上建立，并且它接受DM的作用，将其作为规则所涉及的事情和它们没有涉及的事情之间的桥梁。",
	"A few rules in the core rulebooks sometimes trip up a new player or DM. Here are ten of those rules. Keeping them in mind will help you interpret the options in this book.": "核心规则手册中的一些规则有时会让新玩家或管理员感到困惑。下面是其中的十条规则。牢记这些规则将有助于你解释本书中的选项。",
	"General rules govern each part of the game. For example, the combat rules tell you that melee weapon attacks use Strength and ranged weapon attacks use Dexterity. That's a general rule, and a general rule is in effect as long as something in the game doesn't explicitly say otherwise.": "一般的规则制约着游戏的每一部分。例如，战斗规则告诉你，近战武器攻击使用力量，远程武器攻击使用灵巧。这是一条一般规则，只要游戏中没有明确的规定，一般规则就会生效。",
	"The game also includes elements-class features, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and the like-that sometimes contradict a general rule. When an exception and a general rule disagree, the exception wins. For example, if a feature says you can make melee weapon attacks using your Charisma, you can do so, even though that statement disagrees with the general rule.": " 当例外情况和一般规则不一致时，例外情况获胜。例如，如果一个特征说你可以用你的魅力进行近战武器攻击，你就可以这么做，尽管这个说法与一般规则不一致。",
	"Whenever you divide or multiply a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater.": "每当你在游戏中除以或乘以一个数字时，如果你最后得到的是一个分数，即使这个分数是二分之一或更大，也要向下取整。",
	"Even if more than one factor gives you advantage or disadvantage on a roll, you have it only once, and if you have advantage and disadvantage on the same roll, they cancel each other.": "即使一个以上的因素给你带来优势或劣势，你也只拥有一次，如果你在同一卷中拥有优势和劣势，它们会相互抵消。",
	"Different game effects can affect a target at the same time. For example, two different benefits can give you a bonus to your Armor Class. But when two or more effects have the same proper name, only one of them (the most powerful one if their benefits aren't identical) applies while the durations of the effects overlap. For example, if bless is cast on you when you're still under the effect of an earlier bless, you gain the benefit of only one casting. Similarly, if you're in the radius of more than one Aura of Protection, you benefit only from the one that grants the highest bonus.": "不同的游戏效果可以同时影响一个目标。例如，两个不同的好处可以给你的装甲等级带来奖励。但当两个或更多的效果有相同的专有名词时，只有其中一个（如果它们的好处不一样，则是最强大的一个）适用，而效果的持续时间是重叠的。例如，如果在你仍处于先前的祝福效果之下时对你施放了祝福，你只能获得一次施放的好处。同样地，如果你在一个以上的保护光环的半径内，你只能从给予最高奖励的那个光环中获益。",
	"Certain game features let you take a special action, called a reaction, in response to some event. Making opportunity attacks and casting the shield spell are two typical uses of reactions. If you're unsure when a reaction occurs in relation to its trigger, here's the rule: the reaction happens after its trigger completes, unless the description of the reaction explicitly says otherwise.": "某些游戏功能可以让你采取特殊的行动，称为反应，以回应某些事件。进行机会攻击和施放盾牌咒语是反应的两个典型用途。如果你不确定反应何时发生与其触发有关，那么规则是这样的：反应在其触发完成后发生，除非反应的描述中明确指出。",
	"Once you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn.": "一旦你做出反应，在你下一回合开始之前，你不能再做出另一个反应。",
	"Here's the order that you apply modifiers to damage: (1) any relevant damage immunity, (2) any addition or subtraction to the damage, (3) one relevant damage resistance, and (4) one relevant damage vulnerability.": "以下是你对伤害施加修饰的顺序。(1)任何相关的伤害免疫，(2)对伤害的任何加减，(3)一个相关的伤害抵抗，和(4)一个相关的伤害脆弱性。",
	"Even if multiple sources give you resistance to a type of damage you're taking, you can apply resistance to it only once. The same is true of vulnerability.": "即使有多个来源给你抵抗你所受的某种类型的伤害，你也只能对它施加一次抵抗。脆弱性的情况也是如此。",
	"If your proficiency bonus applies to a roll, you can add the bonus only once to the roll, even if multiple things in the game say your bonus applies. Moreover, if more than one thing tells you to double or halve your bonus, you double it only once or halve it only once before applying it. Whether multiplied, divided, or left at its normal value, the bonus can be used only once per roll.": "如果你的熟练度加成适用于一个卷，你只能把加成加到该卷上一次，即使游戏中的多个东西都说你的加成适用。此外，如果有多件事情告诉你要将你的奖励加倍或减半，你在应用它之前只能将它加倍一次或减半一次。无论是乘以、除以，还是保持其正常值，奖金在每个卷中只能使用一次。",
	"If you want to cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 bonus action, remember that you can't cast any other spells before or after it on the same turn, except for cantrips with a casting time of 1 action.": "如果你想施放一个施放时间为1个额外行动的法术，请记住，在同一回合内，你不能在它之前或之后施放任何其他法术，除了施放时间为1个行动的咒语。",
	"As soon as you start casting a spell or using a special ability that requires concentration, your concentration on another effect ends instantly.": "只要你开始施法或使用需要集中注意力的特殊能力，你对另一个效果的注意力就会立即结束。",
	"Temporary hit points aren't cumulative. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you don't add them together, unless a game feature says you can. Instead, you decide which temporary hit points to keep.": "临时命中率是不能累积的。如果你有临时命中率并得到了更多的命中率，你不会把它们加在一起，除非有游戏特征说你可以。相反，你要决定保留哪些临时打击点数。",
	"The main figures in any D&D campaign are the characters created by the players. The heroics, folly, righteousness, and potential villainy of your characters are at the heart of the story. This chapter provides a variety of new options for them, focusing on additional subclasses for each of the classes in the player's handbook.": "任何D&D活动中的主要人物都是由玩家创造的角色。你的角色的英雄主义、愚蠢、正义和潜在的恶棍是故事的核心。本章为他们提供了各种新的选择，重点是玩家手册中每个类别的额外子类。",
	"Each class offers a character-defining choice at 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level that unlocks a series of special features, not available to the class as a whole. That choice is called a subclass. Each class has a collective term that describes its subclasses; in the fighter, for instance, the subclasses are called martial archetypes, and in the paladin, they're sacred oaths. The table below identifies each of the subclasses in this book. In addition, the section for druids presents details on how the Wild Shape feature works, and the warlock receives a collection of new choices for the class's Eldritch Invocations feature.": "每个阶级在一、二、三级都有一个定义角色的选择，可以解锁一系列的特殊功能，而这些功能是整个阶级所没有的。这种选择被称为子类。每个阶级都有一个描述其子阶级的统称；例如，在战士中，子阶级被称为武术原型，而在圣骑士中，它们是神圣的誓言。下表列出了本书中的每个子类。此外，德鲁伊的部分介绍了 \"野性之形 \"特性的工作细节，术士则为该类的 \"长生召唤 \"特性提供了一系列新的选择。",
	"Each of the class presentations leads off with advice on how to add depth and detail to your character's personality. You can use the tables in these sections as a source of inspiration, or roll a die to randomly determine a result if desired.": "每一节课的介绍都以如何为你的角色的个性增加深度和细节的建议为开端。你可以使用这些部分的表格作为灵感来源，如果需要的话，也可以通过掷骰子来随机确定一个结果。",
	"Following the subclasses, the section called \"this is your life\" presents a series of tables for adding detail to your character's backstory.": "在子类之后，名为 \"这是你的生活 \"的部分提出了一系列表格，用于为你的角色的背景故事添加细节。",
	"The chapter concludes with a selection of feats for the races in the player's handbook, offering ways to delve deeper into a character's racial identity.": "本章最后介绍了玩家手册中的一些种族特技，提供了深入了解角色的种族特性的方法。",

	"The character creation rules in the player's handbook provide all the information you need to define your character in preparation for a life of adventuring. What they don't do is account for all the circumstances that shaped your character during the years between your birth and the start of your career as a member of a class.": "玩家手册中的角色创建规则提供了所有你需要的信息，以确定你的角色，为冒险生活做准备。但它们没有考虑到在你出生和开始作为一个阶级成员的职业生涯之间的所有情况，这些情况塑造了你的角色。",
	"What did your character accomplish or experience before deciding to become an adventurer? What were the circumstances of your birth? How large is your family, and what sorts of relationships do you have with your relatives? Which people were the greatest influences on you during your formative years, for better or worse?": "在决定成为一名冒险家之前，你的角色有什么成就或经历？你出生时的情况是怎样的？你的家庭有多大，你和你的亲戚有什么样的关系？在你成长的岁月里，哪些人对你的影响最大，是好是坏？",
	"To answer these questions and more, you can use the tables and the advice in this section to compose a well-developed backstory for your character-an autobiography of sorts-that you can use to inform how you roleplay the character. Your DM can draw from this material as the campaign proceeds, creating situations and scenarios that build off your previous life experiences.": "为了回答这些问题，你可以使用本节中的表格和建议，为你的角色编写一个完善的背景故事--类似于自传，你可以用它来指导你如何扮演这个角色。在活动进行过程中，你的管理员可以利用这些材料，在你以前的生活经历的基础上创造出一些情况和场景。",
	"Even though these pages are full of tables and die rolls, they don't make up a rules system-in fact, the opposite is true. You can use as much or as little of this material as you desire, and you can make decisions in any order you want.": "尽管这些页面充满了表格和掷骰子的内容，但它们并不构成一个规则体系--事实上，情况恰恰相反。你可以根据自己的意愿使用这些材料，也可以按照自己的意愿做出决定。",
	"For instance, you might not want these tables to help you decide who your parents and siblings are, because that's among the information you've already come up with. But you can still use other parts, such as the section on life events, to provide added depth and detail.": "例如，你可能不希望这些表格帮助你决定谁是你的父母和兄弟姐妹，因为这属于你已经想好的信息。但你仍然可以使用其他部分，如关于生活事件的部分，来提供更多的深度和细节。",
	"If you're comfortable with letting the dice decide a certain fact about your character, go ahead and roll. If not, you can take charge and make the decision, choosing from among the possibilities on a table. Of course, you also have the option of disregarding the result of a die roll if it conflicts with another result. Likewise, if the text instructs you to roll on a table, that's not meant to be taken literally. You can always make your own choice.": "如果你对让骰子决定你的角色的某个事实感到舒服，就去掷吧。如果不是，你可以负责并做出决定，从桌子上的可能性中选择。当然，如果一个骰子的结果与另一个结果相冲突，你也可以选择不考虑它。同样，如果文字指示你在桌子上掷骰子，那也不意味着要按字面意思理解。你可以随时做出自己的选择。",
	"Although these tables are meant to augment the step-by-step character creation process in the player's handbook, they don't occupy a specific place in that process. You can use some of them early on-for instance, it's possible to determine your parents and other family members immediately after deciding your character's race-but you could also wait until later in the process. You might prefer to establish more facts about your character's game identity-such as your class, ability scores, and alignment-before supplementing that information with what's offered here.": "尽管这些表格是为了补充玩家手册中的逐步创建角色的过程，但它们在这个过程中并不占据特定的位置。你可以在早期使用其中的一些表格--例如，在决定了你的角色的种族之后，可以立即确定你的父母和其他家庭成员，但你也可以等到这个过程的后期。在用这里提供的信息补充这些信息之前，你可能更喜欢建立更多关于你的角色的游戏身份的事实--比如你的等级、能力分数和排列组合。",

	"The usual first step in creating your character's life story is to determine your early circumstances. Who were your parents? Where were you born? Did you have any siblings? Who raised you? You can address these questions by using the following tables.": "创造你的角色的生活故事的通常第一步是确定你早期的情况。你的父母是谁？你在哪里出生？你有任何兄弟姐妹吗？谁抚养你？你可以通过使用以下表格来解决这些问题。",
	"You had parents, of course, even if they didn't raise you. To determine what you know about these people, use the Parents table. If you want, you can roll separately on the table for your mother and your father. Use the supplemental tables as desired (particularly Class, Occupation, and Alignment) to learn more about your parents.": "当然，你有父母，即使他们没有抚养你。要确定你对这些人的了解程度，请使用父母表。如果你愿意，你可以为你的母亲和父亲分别在表格上打滚。根据需要使用补充表（特别是等级、职业和结盟）来了解你父母的更多情况。",
