	"Hail and well met, traveler! Welcome to a world of magic and adventure. Originally created by Ed Greenwood, the Forgotten Realms setting has been home to Dungeons & Dragons stories and games for decades. Built for tales of swords and sorcery, the Realms initially grew and flourished in Ed's D&D campaign, which featured heroes like the Knights of Myth Drannor in the Dalelands. Ed also shared glimpses of the Realms in the pages of Dragon magazine, giving D&D players their first tales from the wizard Elminster, the old sage of Shadowdale, who occasionally found his way through a portal between Faerûn and our world and into Ed's living room.": "万岁，你好，旅行者! 欢迎来到一个充满魔法和冒险的世界。被遗忘的领域最初由艾德-格林伍德创造，几十年来一直是《龙与地下城》故事和游戏的家园。为剑与魔法的故事而建，该领域最初在艾德的D&D活动中发展和繁荣，其中有像达勒兰的神话德兰诺骑士这样的英雄。埃德还在《龙》杂志的页面上分享了王国的一瞥，为D&D玩家提供了来自巫师埃尔明斯特的第一个故事，他是影子谷的老圣人，偶尔会通过法鲁恩和我们的世界之间的门户，进入埃德的客厅。",
	"When TSR, the company that owned D&D at the time, sought a new campaign world to expand the D&D multiverse, they chose the Forgotten Realms, and in 1987, the gates were flung wide for players and Dungeon Masters all over the world to come to Faerûn and create their own heroic tales. A year later, author R.A. Salvatore introduced readers to the adventures of the drow outcast Drizzt Do'Urden in his first novel, The Crystal Shard, establishing the Underdark as an essential part of the Realms.": "当当时拥有D&D的TSR公司寻求一个新的战役世界来扩展D&D的多元宇宙时，他们选择了被遗忘的领域，在1987年，大门被打开，全世界的玩家和地下城主都可以来到Faerûn，创造他们自己的英雄故事。一年后，作者R.A. Salvatore在他的第一部小说《水晶碎片》中向读者介绍了被抛弃的鸦人Drizzt Do'Urden的冒险故事，确立了暗黑世界作为王国的重要组成部分。",
	"In the years since, the Forgotten Realms have played host to a vast number of game products, novels, video games, and more, making it one of the most widely visited fantasy settings ever created. The lost portals to the Realms have returned and remained open in the depths of our imaginations and do so to this day, as more and more visitors find their way there.": "在那之后的几年里，被遗忘的王国成为了大量游戏产品、小说、视频游戏等的主人，使其成为有史以来访问量最大的奇幻背景之一。随着越来越多的游客来到这里，被遗忘的领域的门户又回来了，并在我们的想象力的深处保持开放，直到今天也是如此。",
	"It is no surprise, then, that the Forgotten Realms became the setting for the first adventures for fifth edition Dungeons & Dragons. Already, new heroes have accomplished great deeds and saved Faerûn from terrible evil and will continue to do so, as long as the flame of imagination draws them there.": "因此，被遗忘的领域成为第五版《龙与地下城》第一批冒险的背景并不奇怪。新的英雄们已经完成了伟大的事迹，将法鲁恩从可怕的邪恶中拯救出来，并将继续这样做，只要想象力的火焰将他们吸引到那里。",
	"This book is further fuel for the fire sparked by those adventures and the glimpses of the Realms you can find in the fifth edition Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual. It gives you a broad look at the continent of Faerûn and the world of Toril in general, and the regions of the Sword Coast and the North in particular.": "本书是这些冒险和第五版《玩家手册》、《地下城主指南》和《怪物手册》中对王国的一瞥所引发的火种的进一步推动。它让你对法鲁恩大陆和托里尔世界有一个大致的了解，特别是剑海岸和北方地区。",
	"In these pages, you'll learn about the history, lands, and peoples of Faerûn, of the great city-states of the Sword Coast and the North, of the world's gods, and of the factions and forces that support and threaten civilization. Chapter 1 of this book gives an overview of the Sword Coast and nearby lands, its history, the role of magic, and its religions. Chapter 2 goes into detail about the cities and other locations of the Sword Coast. Chapter 3 gives history and some game material for various races and subraces, both common and uncommon, that can be met on the Sword Coast and in the North. Chapter 4 shows how the character options in the Player's Handbook fit into this region and presents new character class options specific to the Forgotten Realms. Chapter 5 gives backgrounds designed to link your characters to the great places, people, and events of Faerûn.": "在这些页面中，你将了解到法鲁恩的历史、土地和人民，了解到剑海岸和北方的伟大城邦，了解到这个世界的神灵，以及支持和威胁文明的派别和力量。本书第1章概述了剑海岸和附近的土地、其历史、魔法的作用以及其宗教。第二章详细介绍了剑海岸的城市和其他地点。第3章给出了在剑海岸和北方可以遇到的各种种族和亚种族的历史和一些游戏材料，包括普通和不普通的种族。第4章展示了《玩家手册》中的角色选项如何适应这一地区，并介绍了被遗忘的领域特有的新角色类别选项。第五章给出了旨在将你的角色与法鲁恩的伟大地方、人物和事件联系起来的背景。",
	"While the body of Realms lore is vast, and this book is only an introduction, the Forgotten Realms setting—like D&D itself—is yours, and has been ever since Ed opened that first portal and invited us to come and visit. The Realms are a place to create and tell your stories, about your adventurers and their deeds. The lands and peoples of Faerûn welcome you, traveler, for it is a place of peril sorely in need of the heroes you will bring forth. Go now, through the portal of imagination and into vast and wonderful realms awaiting beyond.": "虽然境界的传说非常庞大，而且本书只是一个介绍，但被遗忘的境界的设定就像D&D本身一样，是属于你的，而且自从Ed打开第一个入口并邀请我们来参观时就一直如此。境界是一个创造和讲述你的故事的地方，关于你的冒险者和他们的事迹。法鲁恩的土地和人民欢迎你，旅行者，因为它是一个充满危险的地方，非常需要你带来的英雄们。现在就去吧，穿过想象力的门户，进入等待着的广阔而奇妙的领域。",
	"On the world of Toril, between the windswept Sea of Swords to the west and the mysterious lands of Kara-Tur to the east, lies the continent of Faerûn. A place of varied cultures and races, Faerûn is dominated by human lands, be they kingdoms, city-states, or carefully maintained alliances of rural communities. Interspersed among the lands of humans are old dwarven kingdoms and hidden elven enclaves, assimilated populations of gnomes and halflings, and more exotic folk.": "在托里尔世界，西边是风起云涌的剑海，东边是神秘的卡拉图尔，这就是法鲁恩大陆。法鲁恩是一个拥有不同文化和种族的地方，它以人类的土地为主，无论是王国、城邦，还是精心维护的农村社区联盟。在人类的土地上，穿插着古老的矮人王国和隐蔽的精灵飞地，被同化的地精和半身人，以及更多的异国人民。",
	"A great deal of adventure is to be had in the Realms, for those willing to seek it out. The routes between cities and nations often cross into the territory of brigands or marauding humanoids. Every forest, swamp, and mountain range has its own perils, whether lurking bandits, savage orcs and goblinoids, or mighty creatures such as giants and dragons. Ruins dot the landscape and the caverns that wind beneath the surface. In these places, treasures of every living race—and a number of dead ones—wait for adventurers intrepid enough to come and claim them.": "对于那些愿意寻求冒险的人来说，在王国中可以获得大量的冒险机会。城市和国家之间的路线经常会穿越到强盗或掠夺性人类的领地。每个森林、沼泽和山脉都有自己的危险，无论是潜伏的强盗、野蛮的兽人和哥布林诺人，还是巨人和龙等强大的生物。遗迹点缀着风景和地表下蜿蜒的岩洞。在这些地方，每一个活着的种族的宝藏--以及一些死去的种族--都在等待着足够勇敢的冒险家来认领它们。",
	"Faerûn is filled with rich history and wondrous tales of adventure and magic, but the lifeblood of its common people is agriculture and trade. Most rural folk depend on farming to eat, and Faerûnians who live in cities ply skilled trades or use brawn to earn their keep, so they can purchase the goods and food provided by others. News and gossip are carried between population centers by caravans and ships that bring in supplies for trade and by traveling bards and minstrels who recount (or invent) stories to inform and entertain people in taverns, inns, and castles. Adventurers also spread news—while also creating it!": "法鲁恩充满了丰富的历史和奇妙的冒险与魔法故事，但其普通人的命脉是农业和贸易。大多数农村居民依靠耕种来维持生计，而生活在城市的法鲁尼人则从事熟练的贸易或利用体力来赚取生活费，因此他们可以购买别人提供的商品和食物。新闻和流言蜚语通过商队和船只在人口中心之间传播，这些商队和船只为贸易带来物资，而游吟诗人和吟游诗人则在酒馆、旅馆和城堡中讲述（或编造）故事，以告知和娱乐人们。冒险家们也在传播新闻--同时也在创造新闻!",
	"The common folk of Faerûn look on adventurers with a mixture of admiration, envy, and mistrust. Folk believe that any stalwarts willing to risk their lives on behalf of complete strangers should be lauded and rewarded. But such adventurers, if they become successful, amass wealth and personal status at a rate that some people find alarming. Even people who admire these adventurers for their energy and their acts of valor might have misgivings: what horrors will be unleashed if adventurers, heedless or unknowing of the danger, unlock a ruin or a tomb and release an ancient evil into the world?": "法鲁恩的普通民众对冒险者的看法是混合着钦佩、羡慕和不信任。民众认为，任何愿意为完全陌生的人冒生命危险的中坚力量都应该得到赞扬和奖励。但是这样的冒险家，如果他们成功了，就会以一些人认为令人震惊的速度积累财富和个人地位。即使是那些因其精力和英勇行为而钦佩这些冒险家的人，也可能会有疑虑：如果冒险家不注意或不知道危险，打开一个废墟或坟墓，把一个古老的邪恶释放到这个世界上，会有什么恐怖的事情发生？",
	"Most of the people who populate the continent have little or no knowledge of lands outside Faerûn. The most educated among the populace agree that Faerûn is but one continent and that Toril is the whole of the world, but for the majority of people, who don't experience intercontinental travel or extraplanar exploration, \"Faerûn\" is more than large enough of a concept for them to comprehend.": "大多数居住在大陆上的人对Faerûn以外的土地几乎一无所知。受教育程度最高的民众同意Faerûn只是一个大陆，而Toril是世界的全部，但对于大多数人来说，他们没有经历过洲际旅行或星外探索，\"Faerûn \"对他们来说是一个足够大的概念。",
	"Except in the most remote or insular places, Faerûnians are accustomed to seeing people of different cultures, ethnicities, and races. Only in the most cosmopolitan areas does such casual acceptance extend to evil humanoid races—such as goblinoids, orcs, and drow—to say nothing of even more dangerous creatures. Adventurers tend to be more tolerant, accepting exiles, misfits, and redeemed folk from strange lands and with unusual shapes.": "除了在最偏远的地方，法鲁尼人习惯于看到不同文化、民族和种族的人。只有在最国际化的地区，这种随意的接受才会延伸到邪恶的人形种族--如哥布林人、兽人和乌鸦--更不用说更危险的生物。冒险家们倾向于更加宽容，接受流亡者、不合群者和来自陌生土地和具有不寻常形状的被救赎者。",
	"Running along the Sea of Swords from north of Amn to the Sea of Moving Ice, the Sword Coast is a narrow band of territory dominated by the city-states of the area that use the sea for trade. For most who care about such things, the area is delimited by Neverwinter in the north and Baldur's Gate in the south, but territory farther to the north and south that isn't under the sway of a more influential power is usually also included in maps of the Sword Coast.": "沿着剑海从安恩以北到移动冰海，剑海岸是一个狭窄的领土带，由该地区的城邦主导，利用海洋进行贸易。对于大多数关心这些事情的人来说，该地区以北部的永夜城和南部的博德之门为界，但在北部和南部更远的地区，如果不在一个更有影响力的大国的控制之下，通常也包括在剑海岸的地图上。",
	"More broadly, the North refers to all the territory north of Amn, split into two general regions: the Western Heartlands and the Savage Frontier. The Western Heartlands encompasses a narrow strip of civilization running from the Sunset Mountains to the Sea of Swords, and northward from the band of territory marked by the Cloud Peaks and the Troll Mountains to the Trade Way. The Savage Frontier is the name given to the rest of the unsettled or sparsely settled territory in the North, not including the major cities and towns and any settlements in their immediate spheres of influence.": "更广泛地说，北方指的是安恩以北的所有领土，分为两个大区：西部腹地和野蛮边境。西部腹地包括从落日山脉到剑海的狭窄文明地带，以及从云峰和巨魔山脉标志的领土带向北到贸易之路。野蛮边境是对北方其余未定居或定居稀少的领土的称呼，不包括主要城市和城镇以及其直接影响范围内的任何定居点。",
	"Most of the communities, nations, and governments of the North can be grouped into five categories: the cities and towns that are members of the Lords' Alliance, the dwarfholds that have been built throughout the area, the island kingdoms off the coast, the independent realms scattered up and down the coast, and the subterranean environs of the Underdark. Each category is discussed briefly here; more details can be found in chapter 2.": "北方的大多数社区、国家和政府可以归为五类：作为领主联盟成员的城市和城镇、在整个地区建立的矮人家庭、沿海的岛屿王国、散布在沿海的独立王国，以及地下世界的地下环境。这里对每个类别进行了简要的讨论；更多的细节可以在第二章找到。",
	"The Lords' Alliance is a confederation among the rulers of various northern settlements. The number of members on the Council of Lords, the group's governing body, shifts depending on the changing status of member cities and political tensions in the region. Currently, the Lords' Alliance counts these individuals as council members:": "领主联盟是北方各个定居点的统治者之间的一个联盟。领主理事会是该组织的管理机构，其成员的数量根据成员城市的地位变化和该地区的政治紧张局势而变化。目前，领主联盟将这些人算作理事会成员。",
	"Laeral Silverhand, the Open Lord of Waterdeep": "Laeral Silverhand, Waterdeep的开放领主",
	"Dagult Neverember, Lord Protector of Neverwinter": "达古特-纽文伯，永无止境的保护者大人",
	"Taern Hornblade, High Mage of Silverymoon": "Taern Hornblade，银月城的高级法师",
	"Ulder Ravengard, Grand Duke of Baldur's Gate and Marshal of the Flaming Fist": "乌尔德-拉文加德，博德之门的大公爵和烈焰之拳的元帅",
	"Morwen Daggerford, Duchess of Daggerford": "Morwen Daggerford, Daggerford公爵夫人",
	"Selin Ramur, Marchion of Mirabar": "塞林-拉穆尔，米拉巴尔的行进者",
	"Dowell Harpell of Longsaddle": "龙赛德的道尔-哈佩尔",
	"Dagnabbet Waybeard, Queen of Mithral Hall": "Dagnabbet Waybeard, Mithral Hall的女王",
	"Lord Dauner Ilzimmer of Amphail": "安培尔的道纳-伊尔齐默勋爵",
	"Nestra Ruthiol, Waterbaron of Yartar": "内斯特拉-鲁西奥尔，雅尔塔的水巴龙",
	"The Lords' Alliance includes the strongest mercantile powers of the North. In addition to providing military support and a forum for the peaceful airing of differences, the Alliance has always acted under the principle that communities with common cause that engage in trade are less likely to go to war with one another. By maintaining strong trade ties within the alliance as well as outside it, the Lords' Alliance helps to keep the peace.": "领主联盟包括北方最强大的商贾势力。除了提供军事支持和和平解决分歧的论坛外，联盟还一直遵循这样的原则：有共同事业的社区如果从事贸易，就不太可能相互开战。通过在联盟内部和外部保持强有力的贸易联系，领主联盟有助于维持和平。",
	"The various dwarven communities of the North are the heirs and survivors of Delzoun, the great Northkingdom of long ago. Despite continually warring over the centuries with the orcs and goblinoids of the region, and having to fight off assaults from below by duergar and drow, the shield dwarves have stood fast, determined to hold their halls against all threats—and, when necessary, reclaim them.": "北方的各个矮人社区是很久以前伟大的北方王国Delzoun的继承人和幸存者。尽管几个世纪以来不断与该地区的兽人和哥布林人发生战争，并不得不抵御来自地下的杜尔加人和乌鸦的攻击，但盾牌矮人一直坚守着，决心坚守他们的大厅，抵御所有的威胁，并在必要时夺回它们。",
	"Holds that survive from the days of Delzoun include Mithral Hall, Citadel Adbar, and Citadel Felbarr. The fabled city of Gauntlgrym, built by the Delzoun dwarves and recently taken back from the drow, stands as a beacon of resurgent dwarven strength in the North. Stoneshaft Hold and Ironmaster are lonely settlements continually girding themselves for threats real and imagined. Sundabar and Mirabar are also generally considered dwarfholds, despite their substantial human populations.": "从德尔祖恩时代流传下来的堡垒包括米特拉厅（Mithral Hall）、阿德巴城堡（Citadel Adbar）和费尔巴城堡（Citadel Felbarr）。传说中的Gauntlgrym城，由德尔祖恩矮人建造，最近从乌鸦手中夺回，是北方矮人力量复苏的灯塔。石头堡和铁匠铺是孤独的定居点，他们不断为现实和想象中的威胁做好准备。Sundabar和Mirabar通常也被认为是矮人区，尽管他们有大量的人类人口。",
	"Until recently, many of the dwarfholds were members of the Silver Marches (also known as Luruar), an alliance of cities that provided mutual protection across the North. Disagreements and failed obligations during a war with the orc kingdom of Many-Arrows destroyed the remaining trust between members of the Marches, and that pact is no more. The dwarfholds still ally with one another, and individually with nearby human realms, but no longer pledge to stand unified with all their neighbors.": "直到最近，许多矮人家庭都是银色山脉（也被称为Luruar）的成员，这是一个在整个北方提供相互保护的城市联盟。在与兽人王国Many-Arrows的战争中，分歧和失败的义务破坏了马尔奇成员之间剩余的信任，该协议不再存在。矮人家族仍然彼此结盟，并单独与附近的人类王国结盟，但不再保证与所有的邻居团结一致。",
	"Off the western coast of Faerûn are a number of island realms of varying size. The most distant, and yet perhaps the most symbolically important to the mainland, is Evermeet, the island paradise of the elves, reputed to be a part of the divine realm of Arvandor. Much closer to Faerûn are the Whalebones and Ruathym, ancient homes of the ancestors of the Illuskan people, and the Moonshaes, where many of those same people now share the islands with the Ffolk and an elf offshoot known as the Llewyr. The free port of Mintarn lies nearby, a neutral site for meetings between enemies and a recruitment spot that offers abundant jobs for sailors. Despite its size, the tiny island of Orlumbor, with its treacherous harbor and its skilled, in-demand shipwrights, is an independent and influential nation unto itself.": "在法鲁恩的西海岸，有许多大小不一的岛屿王国。最遥远的，但也许是对大陆最具象征意义的，是精灵的天堂--埃弗米特岛，据说是阿凡多神域的一部分。离法鲁恩更近的是 \"鲸骨\"（Whalebones）和 \"鲁阿西姆\"（Ruathym），这是伊鲁斯坎人祖先的古老家园，还有 \"月海\"（Moonshaes），现在许多同族人与弗福克人和一个被称为 \"勒维尔 \"的精灵分支共享这些岛屿。敏塔恩的自由港就在附近，是敌人之间会面的中立地点，也是为水手提供大量工作的招募点。尽管面积不大，小小的奥伦博尔岛却拥有险恶的港口和技术精湛、需求旺盛的船工，是一个独立而有影响力的国家。",
	"In the seas to the south, pirates of many races and predilections sail from the Nelanther Isles, preying on trade running north and south along the coasts. Since the beginning of the Sundering, fabled Lantan and Nimbral have returned. Both the center of invention and the isle of Leira-worshiping illusionists are even more secretive and less welcoming of strangers than before their disappearance.": "在南边的海域，许多种族和偏好的海盗从尼兰特群岛出发，掠夺沿海岸线的南北贸易。自分裂开始以来，传说中的兰坦和尼姆布拉尔已经回归。发明的中心和崇拜莱拉的幻术师的岛屿都比他们消失前更加神秘，对陌生人也不那么欢迎。",
	"Interspersed among the fortresses of the dwarves and the settlements protected by the Lords' Alliance are significant sites that have no collective character, except that they exist largely outside the protection or purview of the great powers of the region. Even the civilized locales among these places, such as Elturgard, exist, at best, in an uneasy tension with the denizens of the wilder lands within and just outside their borders, and survive only through constant vigilance and the steady recruitment of new defenders.": "在矮人的堡垒和受领主联盟保护的定居点中，有一些重要的地方没有集体特征，只是它们在很大程度上存在于该地区大国的保护或权限之外。即使是这些地方中的文明地区，如Elturgard，充其量也只是与边界内外的荒野之地的居民存在着一种不安的紧张关系，只有通过不断的警惕和不断招募新的保卫者才能生存。",
	"A great variety of independent nations and notable locations is encompassed within the wild lands of the North. Among them are the great library of Candlekeep, home of the greatest collection of written lore in Faerûn; the imposing, giant-scale castle of Darkhold; the fortified abbey of Helm's Hold; sites of great battles such as Boareskyr Bridge and the Fields of the Dead; realms of some security, such as Elturgard and Hartsvale; and the yuan-ti realm of Najara. The lands of the Uthgardt, the towns of frigid Icewind Dale, the quiet Trielta Hills, the cutthroat city of Luskan, and the legendary Warlock's Crypt, dominion of the great lich Larloch, are all independent realms, as are the High Moor, the Trollclaws, and the High Forest.": "北方的荒野之地包含了大量的独立国家和著名地点。其中有伟大的烛台图书馆，它是法鲁恩最大的文字传说收藏地；气势恢宏、规模巨大的暗黑城堡；坚固的赫尔姆港修道院；伟大的战役遗址，如博阿里斯基尔桥和死亡之域；一些安全的领域，如埃尔图加德和哈茨维尔；以及纳贾拉的元老国度。乌斯加德的土地、寒冷的冰风谷城镇、宁静的特里尔塔山、残酷的卢斯坎城，以及传说中的术士墓穴，伟大的巫师拉罗克的统治地，都是独立的领域，高沼泽、巨魔堡垒和高森林也是如此。",
	"There is much danger and adventure to be had in the free places of the North, and a great deal of wealth and treasure as well. The ruins of ancient kingdoms and countless smaller settlements litter the countryside, waiting for the right explorers to happen upon them.": "在北方的自由之地，有许多危险和冒险，也有大量的财富和宝藏。古代王国的废墟和无数的小型定居点遍布乡间，等待着合适的探险家去发现它们。",
	"Extending miles downward and outward beneath the surface of Faerûn, and reaching to other continents as well, the great network of subterranean caverns known as the Underdark is home to all manner of strange and deadly creatures. Duergar and drow—dark reflections of dwarves and elves—live in these sunless lands, as do the svirfneblin, or deep gnomes. Most surface-dwelling folk aren't threatened or even disturbed by denizens of the deep places, but the creatures occasionally emerge to raid or to seek some kind of goal in the surface world.": "在Faerûn的地表下向外延伸数英里，并延伸到其他大陆，被称为暗黑的巨大地下洞穴网络是各种奇怪和致命生物的家园。Duergar和drow--矮人和精灵的黑暗反射--生活在这些没有阳光的土地上，就像svirfneblin，或深层地精那样。大多数地表居民不会受到深渊居民的威胁，甚至不会受到干扰，但这些生物偶尔会出现在地表世界，进行袭击或寻求某种目标。",
	"Among the lands of the Underdark beneath the North are the svirfneblin city of Blingdenstone, the duergar city of Gracklstugh, and the infamous drow city of Menzoberranzan. Also prominent is Mantol-Derith, a trading post for Underdark merchants.": "在北境之下的暗黑土地上，有斯维尔芬布林城市布林登斯通（Blingdenstone）、杜尔加城市格拉克斯图（Gracklstugh）和臭名昭著的乌鸦城市门索兰赞（Menzoberranzan）。同样突出的还有曼托尔-德里斯（Mantol-Derith），一个地下城商人的贸易站。",
	"Toril is a vast and wondrous world, filled with an immense diversity of peoples and a rich, full history. For most folk of the Sword Coast, however, knowledge doesn't extend much beyond the confines of the North, and anything \"known\" outside of Faerûn proper is based more in rumor than in fact.": "托里尔是一个广阔而奇妙的世界，充满了巨大的民族多样性和丰富而完整的历史。然而，对于剑海岸的大多数人来说，他们的知识并没有延伸到北方的范围之外，法鲁恩本土之外的任何 \"已知 \"都是基于谣言而非事实的。",
	"The vast central continent of Toril, Faerûn is a land mass divided by a great sea known as the Inner Sea, or the Sea of Fallen Stars. The lands beyond the North can be roughly divided into those to the south and those to the east, becoming more foreign to the folk of the Sword Coast and the North the farther away they are.": "法鲁恩是托里尔广阔的中央大陆，被称为 \"内海 \"或 \"堕落之星之海 \"的大洋所分割。北部以外的土地可以大致分为南部和东部，对于剑海岸和北部的居民来说，越是遥远的地方越是陌生。",
	"Just as \"the North\" describes an area that includes a number of nations and governments, a number of collective terms exist for other regions across Faerûn. Not all such names are used universally, and opinions vary as to which lands qualify in which groups. Here are some currently recognized regional groupings:": "正如 \"北方 \"所描述的区域包括一些国家和政府一样，整个法鲁恩的其他地区也有一些统称。并非所有这类名称都被普遍使用，而且对于哪些土地符合哪些群体的条件也有不同意见。以下是目前公认的一些区域分组。",
	"Damara, Narfell, Sossal, and Vaasa": "达马拉、纳菲尔、索萨和瓦萨",
	"Cormyr, the Dalelands, the Moonsea, and Sembia": "科米尔、达利兰、月海和森比亚",
	"Amn, Calimshan, and Tethyr, also known as the Empires of the Sands": "阿姆、卡利姆山和泰特希尔，也被称为沙场帝国",
	"Chessenta, Mulhorand, and Unther": "Chessenta, Mulhorand, and Unther",
	"To the south of the Sword Coast lie ancient nations, a tremendous, forbidding jungle, and all manner of lands destroyed or transformed by magical cataclysms and upheavals. Amid the ruin and the distress in these realms are signs of renewal and hope, as tenacious civilizations and peoples rebuild, reclaim, and create anew.": "在剑海岸的南部，有古老的国家、巨大的、令人生畏的丛林，以及各种被魔法灾难和动荡摧毁或改变的土地。在这些领域的废墟和苦难中，有更新和希望的迹象，因为顽强的文明和人民正在重建、恢复和重新创造。"
