	"Hail and well met, traveler! Welcome to a world of magic and adventure. Originally created by Ed Greenwood, the Forgotten Realms setting has been home to Dungeons & Dragons stories and games for decades. Built for tales of swords and sorcery, the Realms initially grew and flourished in Ed's D&D campaign, which featured heroes like the Knights of Myth Drannor in the Dalelands. Ed also shared glimpses of the Realms in the pages of Dragon magazine, giving D&D players their first tales from the wizard Elminster, the old sage of Shadowdale, who occasionally found his way through a portal between Faerûn and our world and into Ed's living room.": "万岁，你好，旅行者! 欢迎来到一个充满魔法和冒险的世界。被遗忘的领域最初由艾德-格林伍德创造，几十年来一直是《龙与地下城》故事和游戏的家园。为剑与魔法的故事而建，该领域最初在艾德的D&D活动中发展和繁荣，其中有像达勒兰的神话德兰诺骑士这样的英雄。埃德还在《龙》杂志的页面上分享了王国的一瞥，为D&D玩家提供了来自巫师埃尔明斯特的第一个故事，他是影子谷的老圣人，偶尔会通过法鲁恩和我们的世界之间的门户，进入埃德的客厅。",
	"When TSR, the company that owned D&D at the time, sought a new campaign world to expand the D&D multiverse, they chose the Forgotten Realms, and in 1987, the gates were flung wide for players and Dungeon Masters all over the world to come to Faerûn and create their own heroic tales. A year later, author R.A. Salvatore introduced readers to the adventures of the drow outcast Drizzt Do'Urden in his first novel, The Crystal Shard, establishing the Underdark as an essential part of the Realms.": "当当时拥有D&D的TSR公司寻求一个新的战役世界来扩展D&D的多元宇宙时，他们选择了被遗忘的领域，在1987年，大门被打开，全世界的玩家和地下城主都可以来到Faerûn，创造他们自己的英雄故事。一年后，作者R.A. Salvatore在他的第一部小说《水晶碎片》中向读者介绍了被抛弃的鸦人Drizzt Do'Urden的冒险故事，确立了暗黑世界作为王国的重要组成部分。",
	"In the years since, the Forgotten Realms have played host to a vast number of game products, novels, video games, and more, making it one of the most widely visited fantasy settings ever created. The lost portals to the Realms have returned and remained open in the depths of our imaginations and do so to this day, as more and more visitors find their way there.": "在那之后的几年里，被遗忘的王国成为了大量游戏产品、小说、视频游戏等的主人，使其成为有史以来访问量最大的奇幻背景之一。随着越来越多的游客来到这里，被遗忘的领域的门户又回来了，并在我们的想象力的深处保持开放，直到今天也是如此。",
	"It is no surprise, then, that the Forgotten Realms became the setting for the first adventures for fifth edition Dungeons & Dragons. Already, new heroes have accomplished great deeds and saved Faerûn from terrible evil and will continue to do so, as long as the flame of imagination draws them there.": "因此，被遗忘的领域成为第五版《龙与地下城》第一批冒险的背景并不奇怪。新的英雄们已经完成了伟大的事迹，将法鲁恩从可怕的邪恶中拯救出来，并将继续这样做，只要想象力的火焰将他们吸引到那里。",
	"This book is further fuel for the fire sparked by those adventures and the glimpses of the Realms you can find in the fifth edition Player's Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual. It gives you a broad look at the continent of Faerûn and the world of Toril in general, and the regions of the Sword Coast and the North in particular.": "本书是这些冒险和第五版《玩家手册》、《地下城主指南》和《怪物手册》中对王国的一瞥所引发的火种的进一步推动。它让你对法鲁恩大陆和托里尔世界有一个大致的了解，特别是剑海岸和北方地区。",
	"In these pages, you'll learn about the history, lands, and peoples of Faerûn, of the great city-states of the Sword Coast and the North, of the world's gods, and of the factions and forces that support and threaten civilization. Chapter 1 of this book gives an overview of the Sword Coast and nearby lands, its history, the role of magic, and its religions. Chapter 2 goes into detail about the cities and other locations of the Sword Coast. Chapter 3 gives history and some game material for various races and subraces, both common and uncommon, that can be met on the Sword Coast and in the North. Chapter 4 shows how the character options in the Player's Handbook fit into this region and presents new character class options specific to the Forgotten Realms. Chapter 5 gives backgrounds designed to link your characters to the great places, people, and events of Faerûn.": "在这些页面中，你将了解到法鲁恩的历史、土地和人民，了解到剑海岸和北方的伟大城邦，了解到这个世界的神灵，以及支持和威胁文明的派别和力量。本书第1章概述了剑海岸和附近的土地、其历史、魔法的作用以及其宗教。第二章详细介绍了剑海岸的城市和其他地点。第3章给出了在剑海岸和北方可以遇到的各种种族和亚种族的历史和一些游戏材料，包括普通和不普通的种族。第4章展示了《玩家手册》中的角色选项如何适应这一地区，并介绍了被遗忘的领域特有的新角色类别选项。第五章给出了旨在将你的角色与法鲁恩的伟大地方、人物和事件联系起来的背景。",
	"While the body of Realms lore is vast, and this book is only an introduction, the Forgotten Realms setting—like D&D itself—is yours, and has been ever since Ed opened that first portal and invited us to come and visit. The Realms are a place to create and tell your stories, about your adventurers and their deeds. The lands and peoples of Faerûn welcome you, traveler, for it is a place of peril sorely in need of the heroes you will bring forth. Go now, through the portal of imagination and into vast and wonderful realms awaiting beyond.": "虽然境界的传说非常庞大，而且本书只是一个介绍，但被遗忘的境界的设定就像D&D本身一样，是属于你的，而且自从Ed打开第一个入口并邀请我们来参观时就一直如此。境界是一个创造和讲述你的故事的地方，关于你的冒险者和他们的事迹。法鲁恩的土地和人民欢迎你，旅行者，因为它是一个充满危险的地方，非常需要你带来的英雄们。现在就去吧，穿过想象力的门户，进入等待着的广阔而奇妙的领域。",
	"On the world of Toril, between the windswept Sea of Swords to the west and the mysterious lands of Kara-Tur to the east, lies the continent of Faerûn. A place of varied cultures and races, Faerûn is dominated by human lands, be they kingdoms, city-states, or carefully maintained alliances of rural communities. Interspersed among the lands of humans are old dwarven kingdoms and hidden elven enclaves, assimilated populations of gnomes and halflings, and more exotic folk.": "在托里尔世界，西边是风起云涌的剑海，东边是神秘的卡拉图尔，这就是法鲁恩大陆。法鲁恩是一个拥有不同文化和种族的地方，它以人类的土地为主，无论是王国、城邦，还是精心维护的农村社区联盟。在人类的土地上，穿插着古老的矮人王国和隐蔽的精灵飞地，被同化的地精和半身人，以及更多的异国人民。",
	"A great deal of adventure is to be had in the Realms, for those willing to seek it out. The routes between cities and nations often cross into the territory of brigands or marauding humanoids. Every forest, swamp, and mountain range has its own perils, whether lurking bandits, savage orcs and goblinoids, or mighty creatures such as giants and dragons. Ruins dot the landscape and the caverns that wind beneath the surface. In these places, treasures of every living race—and a number of dead ones—wait for adventurers intrepid enough to come and claim them.": "对于那些愿意寻求冒险的人来说，在王国中可以获得大量的冒险机会。城市和国家之间的路线经常会穿越到强盗或掠夺性人类的领地。每个森林、沼泽和山脉都有自己的危险，无论是潜伏的强盗、野蛮的兽人和哥布林诺人，还是巨人和龙等强大的生物。遗迹点缀着风景和地表下蜿蜒的岩洞。在这些地方，每一个活着的种族的宝藏--以及一些死去的种族--都在等待着足够勇敢的冒险家来认领它们。",
	"Faerûn is filled with rich history and wondrous tales of adventure and magic, but the lifeblood of its common people is agriculture and trade. Most rural folk depend on farming to eat, and Faerûnians who live in cities ply skilled trades or use brawn to earn their keep, so they can purchase the goods and food provided by others. News and gossip are carried between population centers by caravans and ships that bring in supplies for trade and by traveling bards and minstrels who recount (or invent) stories to inform and entertain people in taverns, inns, and castles. Adventurers also spread news—while also creating it!": "法鲁恩充满了丰富的历史和奇妙的冒险与魔法故事，但其普通人的命脉是农业和贸易。大多数农村居民依靠耕种来维持生计，而生活在城市的法鲁尼人则从事熟练的贸易或利用体力来赚取生活费，因此他们可以购买别人提供的商品和食物。新闻和流言蜚语通过商队和船只在人口中心之间传播，这些商队和船只为贸易带来物资，而游吟诗人和吟游诗人则在酒馆、旅馆和城堡中讲述（或编造）故事，以告知和娱乐人们。冒险家们也在传播新闻--同时也在创造新闻!",
	"The common folk of Faerûn look on adventurers with a mixture of admiration, envy, and mistrust. Folk believe that any stalwarts willing to risk their lives on behalf of complete strangers should be lauded and rewarded. But such adventurers, if they become successful, amass wealth and personal status at a rate that some people find alarming. Even people who admire these adventurers for their energy and their acts of valor might have misgivings: what horrors will be unleashed if adventurers, heedless or unknowing of the danger, unlock a ruin or a tomb and release an ancient evil into the world?": "法鲁恩的普通民众对冒险者的看法是混合着钦佩、羡慕和不信任。民众认为，任何愿意为完全陌生的人冒生命危险的中坚力量都应该得到赞扬和奖励。但是这样的冒险家，如果他们成功了，就会以一些人认为令人震惊的速度积累财富和个人地位。即使是那些因其精力和英勇行为而钦佩这些冒险家的人，也可能会有疑虑：如果冒险家不注意或不知道危险，打开一个废墟或坟墓，把一个古老的邪恶释放到这个世界上，会有什么恐怖的事情发生？",
	"Most of the people who populate the continent have little or no knowledge of lands outside Faerûn. The most educated among the populace agree that Faerûn is but one continent and that Toril is the whole of the world, but for the majority of people, who don't experience intercontinental travel or extraplanar exploration, \"Faerûn\" is more than large enough of a concept for them to comprehend.": "大多数居住在大陆上的人对Faerûn以外的土地几乎一无所知。受教育程度最高的民众同意Faerûn只是一个大陆，而Toril是世界的全部，但对于大多数人来说，他们没有经历过洲际旅行或星外探索，\"Faerûn \"对他们来说是一个足够大的概念。",
	"Except in the most remote or insular places, Faerûnians are accustomed to seeing people of different cultures, ethnicities, and races. Only in the most cosmopolitan areas does such casual acceptance extend to evil humanoid races—such as goblinoids, orcs, and drow—to say nothing of even more dangerous creatures. Adventurers tend to be more tolerant, accepting exiles, misfits, and redeemed folk from strange lands and with unusual shapes.": "除了在最偏远的地方，法鲁尼人习惯于看到不同文化、民族和种族的人。只有在最国际化的地区，这种随意的接受才会延伸到邪恶的人形种族--如哥布林人、兽人和乌鸦--更不用说更危险的生物。冒险家们倾向于更加宽容，接受流亡者、不合群者和来自陌生土地和具有不寻常形状的被救赎者。",
	"Running along the Sea of Swords from north of Amn to the Sea of Moving Ice, the Sword Coast is a narrow band of territory dominated by the city-states of the area that use the sea for trade. For most who care about such things, the area is delimited by Neverwinter in the north and Baldur's Gate in the south, but territory farther to the north and south that isn't under the sway of a more influential power is usually also included in maps of the Sword Coast.": "沿着剑海从安恩以北到移动冰海，剑海岸是一个狭窄的领土带，由该地区的城邦主导，利用海洋进行贸易。对于大多数关心这些事情的人来说，该地区以北部的永夜城和南部的博德之门为界，但在北部和南部更远的地区，如果不在一个更有影响力的大国的控制之下，通常也包括在剑海岸的地图上。",
	"More broadly, the North refers to all the territory north of Amn, split into two general regions: the Western Heartlands and the Savage Frontier. The Western Heartlands encompasses a narrow strip of civilization running from the Sunset Mountains to the Sea of Swords, and northward from the band of territory marked by the Cloud Peaks and the Troll Mountains to the Trade Way. The Savage Frontier is the name given to the rest of the unsettled or sparsely settled territory in the North, not including the major cities and towns and any settlements in their immediate spheres of influence.": "更广泛地说，北方指的是安恩以北的所有领土，分为两个大区：西部腹地和野蛮边境。西部腹地包括从落日山脉到剑海的狭窄文明地带，以及从云峰和巨魔山脉标志的领土带向北到贸易之路。野蛮边境是对北方其余未定居或定居稀少的领土的称呼，不包括主要城市和城镇以及其直接影响范围内的任何定居点。",
	"Most of the communities, nations, and governments of the North can be grouped into five categories: the cities and towns that are members of the Lords' Alliance, the dwarfholds that have been built throughout the area, the island kingdoms off the coast, the independent realms scattered up and down the coast, and the subterranean environs of the Underdark. Each category is discussed briefly here; more details can be found in chapter 2.": "北方的大多数社区、国家和政府可以归为五类：作为领主联盟成员的城市和城镇、在整个地区建立的矮人家庭、沿海的岛屿王国、散布在沿海的独立王国，以及地下世界的地下环境。这里对每个类别进行了简要的讨论；更多的细节可以在第二章找到。",
	"The Lords' Alliance is a confederation among the rulers of various northern settlements. The number of members on the Council of Lords, the group's governing body, shifts depending on the changing status of member cities and political tensions in the region. Currently, the Lords' Alliance counts these individuals as council members:": "领主联盟是北方各个定居点的统治者之间的一个联盟。领主理事会是该组织的管理机构，其成员的数量根据成员城市的地位变化和该地区的政治紧张局势而变化。目前，领主联盟将这些人算作理事会成员。",
	"Laeral Silverhand, the Open Lord of Waterdeep": "Laeral Silverhand, Waterdeep的开放领主",
	"Dagult Neverember, Lord Protector of Neverwinter": "达古特-纽文伯，永无止境的保护者大人",
	"Taern Hornblade, High Mage of Silverymoon": "Taern Hornblade，银月城的高级法师",
	"Ulder Ravengard, Grand Duke of Baldur's Gate and Marshal of the Flaming Fist": "乌尔德-拉文加德，博德之门的大公爵和烈焰之拳的元帅",
	"Morwen Daggerford, Duchess of Daggerford": "Morwen Daggerford, Daggerford公爵夫人",
	"Selin Ramur, Marchion of Mirabar": "塞林-拉穆尔，米拉巴尔的行进者",
	"Dowell Harpell of Longsaddle": "龙赛德的道尔-哈佩尔",
	"Dagnabbet Waybeard, Queen of Mithral Hall": "Dagnabbet Waybeard, Mithral Hall的女王",
	"Lord Dauner Ilzimmer of Amphail": "安培尔的道纳-伊尔齐默勋爵",
	"Nestra Ruthiol, Waterbaron of Yartar": "内斯特拉-鲁西奥尔，雅尔塔的水巴龙",
	"The Lords' Alliance includes the strongest mercantile powers of the North. In addition to providing military support and a forum for the peaceful airing of differences, the Alliance has always acted under the principle that communities with common cause that engage in trade are less likely to go to war with one another. By maintaining strong trade ties within the alliance as well as outside it, the Lords' Alliance helps to keep the peace.": "领主联盟包括北方最强大的商贾势力。除了提供军事支持和和平解决分歧的论坛外，联盟还一直遵循这样的原则：有共同事业的社区如果从事贸易，就不太可能相互开战。通过在联盟内部和外部保持强有力的贸易联系，领主联盟有助于维持和平。",
	"The various dwarven communities of the North are the heirs and survivors of Delzoun, the great Northkingdom of long ago. Despite continually warring over the centuries with the orcs and goblinoids of the region, and having to fight off assaults from below by duergar and drow, the shield dwarves have stood fast, determined to hold their halls against all threats—and, when necessary, reclaim them.": "北方的各个矮人社区是很久以前伟大的北方王国Delzoun的继承人和幸存者。尽管几个世纪以来不断与该地区的兽人和哥布林人发生战争，并不得不抵御来自地下的杜尔加人和乌鸦的攻击，但盾牌矮人一直坚守着，决心坚守他们的大厅，抵御所有的威胁，并在必要时夺回它们。",
	"Holds that survive from the days of Delzoun include Mithral Hall, Citadel Adbar, and Citadel Felbarr. The fabled city of Gauntlgrym, built by the Delzoun dwarves and recently taken back from the drow, stands as a beacon of resurgent dwarven strength in the North. Stoneshaft Hold and Ironmaster are lonely settlements continually girding themselves for threats real and imagined. Sundabar and Mirabar are also generally considered dwarfholds, despite their substantial human populations.": "从德尔祖恩时代流传下来的堡垒包括米特拉厅（Mithral Hall）、阿德巴城堡（Citadel Adbar）和费尔巴城堡（Citadel Felbarr）。传说中的Gauntlgrym城，由德尔祖恩矮人建造，最近从乌鸦手中夺回，是北方矮人力量复苏的灯塔。石头堡和铁匠铺是孤独的定居点，他们不断为现实和想象中的威胁做好准备。Sundabar和Mirabar通常也被认为是矮人区，尽管他们有大量的人类人口。",
	"Until recently, many of the dwarfholds were members of the Silver Marches (also known as Luruar), an alliance of cities that provided mutual protection across the North. Disagreements and failed obligations during a war with the orc kingdom of Many-Arrows destroyed the remaining trust between members of the Marches, and that pact is no more. The dwarfholds still ally with one another, and individually with nearby human realms, but no longer pledge to stand unified with all their neighbors.": "直到最近，许多矮人家庭都是银色山脉（也被称为Luruar）的成员，这是一个在整个北方提供相互保护的城市联盟。在与兽人王国Many-Arrows的战争中，分歧和失败的义务破坏了马尔奇成员之间剩余的信任，该协议不再存在。矮人家族仍然彼此结盟，并单独与附近的人类王国结盟，但不再保证与所有的邻居团结一致。",
	"Off the western coast of Faerûn are a number of island realms of varying size. The most distant, and yet perhaps the most symbolically important to the mainland, is Evermeet, the island paradise of the elves, reputed to be a part of the divine realm of Arvandor. Much closer to Faerûn are the Whalebones and Ruathym, ancient homes of the ancestors of the Illuskan people, and the Moonshaes, where many of those same people now share the islands with the Ffolk and an elf offshoot known as the Llewyr. The free port of Mintarn lies nearby, a neutral site for meetings between enemies and a recruitment spot that offers abundant jobs for sailors. Despite its size, the tiny island of Orlumbor, with its treacherous harbor and its skilled, in-demand shipwrights, is an independent and influential nation unto itself.": "在法鲁恩的西海岸，有许多大小不一的岛屿王国。最遥远的，但也许是对大陆最具象征意义的，是精灵的天堂--埃弗米特岛，据说是阿凡多神域的一部分。离法鲁恩更近的是 \"鲸骨\"（Whalebones）和 \"鲁阿西姆\"（Ruathym），这是伊鲁斯坎人祖先的古老家园，还有 \"月海\"（Moonshaes），现在许多同族人与弗福克人和一个被称为 \"勒维尔 \"的精灵分支共享这些岛屿。敏塔恩的自由港就在附近，是敌人之间会面的中立地点，也是为水手提供大量工作的招募点。尽管面积不大，小小的奥伦博尔岛却拥有险恶的港口和技术精湛、需求旺盛的船工，是一个独立而有影响力的国家。",
	"In the seas to the south, pirates of many races and predilections sail from the Nelanther Isles, preying on trade running north and south along the coasts. Since the beginning of the Sundering, fabled Lantan and Nimbral have returned. Both the center of invention and the isle of Leira-worshiping illusionists are even more secretive and less welcoming of strangers than before their disappearance.": "在南边的海域，许多种族和偏好的海盗从尼兰特群岛出发，掠夺沿海岸线的南北贸易。自分裂开始以来，传说中的兰坦和尼姆布拉尔已经回归。发明的中心和崇拜莱拉的幻术师的岛屿都比他们消失前更加神秘，对陌生人也不那么欢迎。",
	"Interspersed among the fortresses of the dwarves and the settlements protected by the Lords' Alliance are significant sites that have no collective character, except that they exist largely outside the protection or purview of the great powers of the region. Even the civilized locales among these places, such as Elturgard, exist, at best, in an uneasy tension with the denizens of the wilder lands within and just outside their borders, and survive only through constant vigilance and the steady recruitment of new defenders.": "在矮人的堡垒和受领主联盟保护的定居点中，有一些重要的地方没有集体特征，只是它们在很大程度上存在于该地区大国的保护或权限之外。即使是这些地方中的文明地区，如Elturgard，充其量也只是与边界内外的荒野之地的居民存在着一种不安的紧张关系，只有通过不断的警惕和不断招募新的保卫者才能生存。",
	"A great variety of independent nations and notable locations is encompassed within the wild lands of the North. Among them are the great library of Candlekeep, home of the greatest collection of written lore in Faerûn; the imposing, giant-scale castle of Darkhold; the fortified abbey of Helm's Hold; sites of great battles such as Boareskyr Bridge and the Fields of the Dead; realms of some security, such as Elturgard and Hartsvale; and the yuan-ti realm of Najara. The lands of the Uthgardt, the towns of frigid Icewind Dale, the quiet Trielta Hills, the cutthroat city of Luskan, and the legendary Warlock's Crypt, dominion of the great lich Larloch, are all independent realms, as are the High Moor, the Trollclaws, and the High Forest.": "北方的荒野之地包含了大量的独立国家和著名地点。其中有伟大的烛台图书馆，它是法鲁恩最大的文字传说收藏地；气势恢宏、规模巨大的暗黑城堡；坚固的赫尔姆港修道院；伟大的战役遗址，如博阿里斯基尔桥和死亡之域；一些安全的领域，如埃尔图加德和哈茨维尔；以及纳贾拉的元老国度。乌斯加德的土地、寒冷的冰风谷城镇、宁静的特里尔塔山、残酷的卢斯坎城，以及传说中的术士墓穴，伟大的巫师拉罗克的统治地，都是独立的领域，高沼泽、巨魔堡垒和高森林也是如此。",
	"There is much danger and adventure to be had in the free places of the North, and a great deal of wealth and treasure as well. The ruins of ancient kingdoms and countless smaller settlements litter the countryside, waiting for the right explorers to happen upon them.": "在北方的自由之地，有许多危险和冒险，也有大量的财富和宝藏。古代王国的废墟和无数的小型定居点遍布乡间，等待着合适的探险家去发现它们。",
	"Extending miles downward and outward beneath the surface of Faerûn, and reaching to other continents as well, the great network of subterranean caverns known as the Underdark is home to all manner of strange and deadly creatures. Duergar and drow—dark reflections of dwarves and elves—live in these sunless lands, as do the svirfneblin, or deep gnomes. Most surface-dwelling folk aren't threatened or even disturbed by denizens of the deep places, but the creatures occasionally emerge to raid or to seek some kind of goal in the surface world.": "在Faerûn的地表下向外延伸数英里，并延伸到其他大陆，被称为暗黑的巨大地下洞穴网络是各种奇怪和致命生物的家园。Duergar和drow--矮人和精灵的黑暗反射--生活在这些没有阳光的土地上，就像svirfneblin，或深层地精那样。大多数地表居民不会受到深渊居民的威胁，甚至不会受到干扰，但这些生物偶尔会出现在地表世界，进行袭击或寻求某种目标。",
	"Among the lands of the Underdark beneath the North are the svirfneblin city of Blingdenstone, the duergar city of Gracklstugh, and the infamous drow city of Menzoberranzan. Also prominent is Mantol-Derith, a trading post for Underdark merchants.": "在北境之下的暗黑土地上，有斯维尔芬布林城市布林登斯通（Blingdenstone）、杜尔加城市格拉克斯图（Gracklstugh）和臭名昭著的乌鸦城市门索兰赞（Menzoberranzan）。同样突出的还有曼托尔-德里斯（Mantol-Derith），一个地下城商人的贸易站。",
	"Toril is a vast and wondrous world, filled with an immense diversity of peoples and a rich, full history. For most folk of the Sword Coast, however, knowledge doesn't extend much beyond the confines of the North, and anything \"known\" outside of Faerûn proper is based more in rumor than in fact.": "托里尔是一个广阔而奇妙的世界，充满了巨大的民族多样性和丰富而完整的历史。然而，对于剑海岸的大多数人来说，他们的知识并没有延伸到北方的范围之外，法鲁恩本土之外的任何 \"已知 \"都是基于谣言而非事实的。",
	"The vast central continent of Toril, Faerûn is a land mass divided by a great sea known as the Inner Sea, or the Sea of Fallen Stars. The lands beyond the North can be roughly divided into those to the south and those to the east, becoming more foreign to the folk of the Sword Coast and the North the farther away they are.": "法鲁恩是托里尔广阔的中央大陆，被称为 \"内海 \"或 \"堕落之星之海 \"的大洋所分割。北部以外的土地可以大致分为南部和东部，对于剑海岸和北部的居民来说，越是遥远的地方越是陌生。",
	"Just as \"the North\" describes an area that includes a number of nations and governments, a number of collective terms exist for other regions across Faerûn. Not all such names are used universally, and opinions vary as to which lands qualify in which groups. Here are some currently recognized regional groupings:": "正如 \"北方 \"所描述的区域包括一些国家和政府一样，整个法鲁恩的其他地区也有一些统称。并非所有这类名称都被普遍使用，而且对于哪些土地符合哪些群体的条件也有不同意见。以下是目前公认的一些区域分组。",
	"Damara, Narfell, Sossal, and Vaasa": "达马拉、纳菲尔、索萨和瓦萨",
	"Cormyr, the Dalelands, the Moonsea, and Sembia": "科米尔、达利兰、月海和森比亚",
	"Amn, Calimshan, and Tethyr, also known as the Empires of the Sands": "阿姆、卡利姆山和泰特希尔，也被称为沙场帝国",
	"Chessenta, Mulhorand, and Unther": "Chessenta, Mulhorand, and Unther",
	"To the south of the Sword Coast lie ancient nations, a tremendous, forbidding jungle, and all manner of lands destroyed or transformed by magical cataclysms and upheavals. Amid the ruin and the distress in these realms are signs of renewal and hope, as tenacious civilizations and peoples rebuild, reclaim, and create anew.": "在剑海岸的南部，有古老的国家、巨大的、令人生畏的丛林，以及各种被魔法灾难和动荡摧毁或改变的土地。在这些领域的废墟和苦难中，有更新和希望的迹象，因为顽强的文明和人民正在重建、恢复和重新创造。",
	"A nation led by the representatives of five noble families, Amn is a place where the wealthy rule, openly and without pretense. Shrewd traders and ruthless in business, Amnians believe that the end of a successful transaction is justified by any means, ethical or otherwise. Although the nation is richer by far than even the northern metropolises of Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep, its influence is curtailed by the unwillingness of its rulers to work together in the nation's best interest. The members of the Council of Five are fairly unified and tight-fisted in their control of Amn, but their ability to affect events outside their own borders is limited because they can't agree enough on major matters of foreign policy. The oligarchs utterly control their nation, but beyond the areas that each rules, their families and businesses compete with one another and with the locals of far-flung places.": "作为一个由五个贵族家族代表领导的国家，安曼是一个富人统治的地方，公开且不加掩饰。精明的商人和无情的商人，阿姆恩人相信，成功的交易结束后，任何手段都是合理的，不管是道德的还是其他的。虽然这个国家甚至比北方的大都市博德之门和沃特德普还要富有，但由于统治者不愿意为国家的最佳利益而合作，其影响力受到了限制。五人委员会的成员在控制安恩方面相当团结，而且手腕很紧，但他们影响自己边界以外事件的能力有限，因为他们在外交政策的重大问题上无法达成足够的共识。寡头们完全控制着他们的国家，但在各自统治的地区之外，他们的家庭和企业相互竞争，并与遥远地方的当地人竞争。",
	"The use of arcane magic is illegal in Amn, meaning that the only authorized spellcasters in the nation are wielders of divine magic who enjoy the support and patronage of a temple, and users of arcane magic who have been given special dispensation by one of the oligarchs. So pervasive is the sway of Amn's oligarchy that few crimes merit physical punishment but those that involve the use of arcane magic or an offense against one of the council's merchant houses. Other infractions are forgiven after the miscreant makes payment of an appropriate fine.": "在安恩，使用奥术魔法是非法的，这意味着在这个国家，唯一被授权的施法者是享有神庙支持和赞助的神圣魔法的挥舞者，以及得到某个寡头特别豁免的奥术魔法使用者。阿姆的寡头统治是如此普遍，以至于除了那些涉及使用奥术魔法或对议会的某个商行的犯罪行为，很少有犯罪行为值得体罚。其他违法行为在犯罪者支付了适当的罚款后会被宽恕。",
	"This southern land has long been the battleground for warring genies. After years of struggling beneath their genasi masters, human slaves arose to follow a Chosen of Ilmater, at first using nonviolent resistance, and then erupting in full rebellion following his disappearance. They overthrew the genie lords of Calimport and Memnon, casting the remaining genies out of the cities and back to their elemental homes or into the depths of the deserts.": "这片南部土地长期以来一直是交战精灵的战场。经过多年在精灵主人手下的挣扎，人类奴隶起来追随伊尔马特的神选者，起初使用非暴力抵抗，然后在他失踪后爆发了全面的叛乱。他们推翻了卡里姆波特和梅姆农的精灵领主，将剩余的精灵赶出城市，回到他们的元素家园或沙漠的深处。",
	"Much of Calimshan is a chaotic place dominated by wealth, political influence, and personal power. Many pray for the return of the Chosen and the completion of his work. Others are learning to live together without genie masters, and to grudgingly accept the remaining genasi among them.": "卡里姆山的大部分地区是一个由财富、政治影响和个人权力主导的混乱之地。许多人祈祷天选之人的回归和他的工作的完成。其他人正在学习如何在没有精灵主人的情况下共同生活，并勉强接受他们中剩余的精灵。",
	"The vast, choking jungles of Chult hide what many believe to be great mineral wealth, including large gemstones and veins of ore. Poisonous flora and fauna riddle the jungles, but some still brave the dangers to seek their fortunes. Some of the exotic plants that grow only in Chult fetch high prices in mainland markets. Ruined Mezro stands across the sea from Calimshan, waiting for explorers and its displaced people to cleanse the city of its undead inhabitants and uncover the treasures that lie hidden there.": "丘尔特广阔的、令人窒息的丛林中隐藏着许多人认为是巨大的矿物财富，包括大型宝石和矿脉。丛林中遍布有毒的动植物，但有些人仍然冒着危险去寻找财富。一些只生长在楚尔特的奇特植物在大陆市场上卖出了高价。残破的梅兹罗与卡利姆山隔海相望，等待着探险家和流离失所的人们清理城市中的亡灵居民，发掘隐藏在那里的宝藏。",
	"Eastward along the Chultan peninsula lie the remains of Thindol and Samarach. Despite the apparent fall of both civilizations, Thindol remains infested with yuan-ti, while the illusions cloaking Samarach's mountain passes conceal the activities in that nation.": "沿着苏丹半岛向东，是廷多和萨马拉奇的遗迹。尽管这两个文明都已明显衰落，但廷多尔仍然有元老级人物出没，而笼罩在萨马拉奇山口的幻象则掩盖了这个国家的活动。",
	"Situated on a warm plain on the shore of the Great Sea, Dambrath is ruled by nomadic clans of human horse riders who revere Silvanus, Malar, and occasionally Selûne. Given the Dambrathans' history of domination by the Crinti, a ruling caste of half-drow, it is no surprise that they reserve their greatest hatred for the drow.": "坐落在大海之滨的温暖平原上，丹布拉特被人类骑马者的游牧部族所统治，他们崇尚希尔瓦娜斯、马拉尔，偶尔也崇尚塞鲁恩。鉴于Dambrathans被Crinti统治的历史，一个半乌鸦的统治种姓，他们对乌鸦保留最大的仇恨并不奇怪。",
	"The clans meet twice a year at a sacred site known as the Hills of the Kings, where dozens of totem sculptures are preserved. At these gatherings, each clan updates its totem with an account of its exploits over the previous seasons. Many Dambrathans seek out lycanthropy as a means of showing reverence for their favored deity and honoring their heritage.": "各部族每年在一个被称为 \"国王山 \"的圣地聚会两次，那里保存着几十个图腾雕塑。在这些聚会上，每个部族都会更新自己的图腾，讲述自己在前几个季节的经历。许多Dambrathans寻求狼人的帮助，以此来表达对他们喜爱的神灵的敬意，并尊重他们的遗产。",
	"A blasted near-desert north and east of the North Wall mountains bordering Halruaa, Elfharrow isn't a name bestowed by its residents, but rather the sobriquet that travelers use for this violent region. The tribes of xenophobic elves that claim this area don't hesitate to discourage uninvited guests by any means necessary. A simple group of pilgrims might be scared off with some arrows, while a band of hunters or explorers is likely to be killed outright.": "Elfharrow是北墙山脉以北和以东与Halruaa接壤的一片被炸毁的近乎沙漠的地方，它并不是居民赋予的名字，而是旅行者对这个暴力地区的昵称。声称拥有这一地区的排外精灵部落毫不犹豫地用任何必要的手段来阻止不速之客。一群简单的朝圣者可能会被一些箭矢吓跑，而一队猎人或探险家则可能被直接杀死。",
	"Food is sparse in this region, with the forests long since vanished, and as a result the elves of Elfharrow fiercely protect the herds of animals they have cultivated. The elves have no interest in looting the cities of fallen Lapaliiya, but neither are they willing to allow \"adventurers\" free access to those lands through their territory.": "这个地区的食物很稀少，森林早就消失了，因此精灵们激烈地保护着他们培养的动物群。精灵们对掠夺堕落的Lapaliiya的城市没有兴趣，但他们也不愿意让 \"冒险者 \"通过他们的领土自由进入这些土地。",
	"Once believed destroyed in the conflagration of the Spellplague, Halruaa has largely been restored to the insular, magic-mighty nation it once was. Because of the foresight of their divinations, Halruaan wizards were able to use the raging blue fire that followed Mystra's death to propel their nation safely into the realm of Toril's twin, Abeir (displacing part of that world into the Plane of Shadow).": "曾经被认为毁于法术瘟疫的大火，Halruaa在很大程度上已经恢复了它曾经是一个封闭的、魔法强大的国家。由于占卜的先见之明，Halruaan的巫师们能够利用Mystra死亡后的熊熊蓝火，将他们的国家安全地推进到Toril的孪生兄弟Abeir的领域（将那个世界的一部分置换到阴影界）。",
	"Now that the events of those times have mostly been undone, the famed Halruaan skyships and waterborne vessels have spread out from their home once again, seeking to establish trading routes and political connections, as well as to learn what has changed of the world in their century of absence.": "现在，那些时代的事件大多已经被撤销，著名的Halruaan天船和水运船只再次从他们的家园出发，寻求建立贸易路线和政治联系，以及了解在他们缺席的一个世纪里世界发生了什么变化。",
	"Far to the south and east of the Sword Coast, the Lake of Steam is more accurately an inland sea, its waters tainted by volcanism and undrinkable. Around its perimeter is a conglomeration of city-states and minor baronies typified by the shifting domains known as the Border Kingdoms. Here, along the southern shore of the lake, explorers and fortune seekers squander their amassed wealth building castles, founding communities, and drawing loyal vassals to them—only to have all those good works disappear within a generation or two. In some cases, one of these realms is fortunate to be saved from its inevitable decline by another group of successful adventurers, who inject enough wealth and wisdom to keep the enterprise going a few more decades.": "远在剑海岸的南部和东部，蒸汽湖更准确地说，是一个内陆海，它的水被火山污染，无法饮用。在它的周围是城邦和小男爵的联合体，其典型特征是被称为边境王国的变幻不定的领域。在这里，沿着湖的南岸，探险家和财富寻求者挥霍着他们积累的财富，建造城堡，建立社区，并吸引忠诚的附庸，但所有这些善举在一两代人内就消失了。在某些情况下，其中一个王国很幸运地被另一群成功的冒险家从不可避免的衰落中拯救出来，他们注入了足够的财富和智慧，使这个企业再持续数十年。",
	"Long the homeland of halflings and thought to be the place where their race had its genesis, Luiren was lost during the Spellplague to a great inundation of the sea. In the century since that great disaster, the waters receded, and now stories told by travelers from the south tell of halfling communities that survived as island redoubts.": "长期以来，卢伊伦是半身人的故乡，并被认为是他们种族的起源地，但在咒语瘟疫期间，卢伊伦被大海淹没。在那场大灾难之后的一个世纪里，海水退去了，现在来自南方的旅行者讲述的故事中，半身人社区作为岛屿的堡垒而幸存下来。",
	"Tethyr is a feudal realm ruled by Queen Anais from its capital of Darromar. The queen commands her dukes, who in turn receive homage from the counts and countesses of the realm, appoint sheriffs over their counties, and generally maintain order. The farmlands of Tethyr are abundant, and its markets flow freely with trade from the Western Heartlands.": "泰特希尔是一个封建王国，由安娜丝女王在其首都达罗玛统治。女王指挥她的公爵们，而公爵们又接受王国的伯爵和女伯爵的敬意，任命郡的治安官，并普遍维持秩序。泰特希尔的农田很肥沃，其市场上有来自西部中心地带的贸易自由流动。",
	"Tethyr has seen more than its share of noble intrigue and royal murder, and adventurers who are native to Tethyr or merely passing through that land are often drawn into such plots, either as unwitting accomplices or as easy scapegoats.": "泰特希尔见证了更多的贵族阴谋和皇室谋杀，而那些土生土长的泰特希尔人或只是路过这片土地的冒险者往往被卷入这样的阴谋，要么成为不知情的帮凶，要么成为容易的替罪羊。",
	"To the east lie many of the older nations of the Realms, including the Western Heartlands of Faerûn—those civilizations centrally located on the continent, and thereby best able to take advantage of trade routes and access to the Sea of Fallen Stars. As in the North, there are cold lands to the east, as well as more temperate regions. As one travels farther from the Sword Coast, one moves from lands not so different from one's own to places so foreign they might as well exist on other continents or worlds—which a few of them actually have done.": "东部是许多古老的王国，包括法鲁恩的西部中心地带--这些文明位于大陆的中心位置，因此最能利用贸易路线和进入堕落星海的机会。和北方一样，东部有寒冷的土地，也有比较温和的地区。当你离开剑海岸越远，你就会从与你自己的土地相差无几的地方转移到如此陌生的地方，它们可能存在于其他大陆或世界上--其中有几个地方实际上已经存在了。",
	"The great peninsula of Aglarond juts out into the Inner Sea, and that body of water and the forests of the Yuirwood define much of the nation's character. A realm of humans living in harmony with their elf and half-elf neighbors, Aglarond has been a foe of Thay for centuries, in part due to the temperament of its former ruler, the Simbul. The nation is now ruled by a Simbarch Council, which has backed away from open hostilities with Thay. With the restoration of the Weave, the ongoing changes to the political landscape, and calls for elven independence within the nation, it is unclear what sort of place Aglarond will be in a generation's time, except that its potential for great change will be realized.": "阿格拉隆的大半岛伸入内海，那片水体和Yuirwood的森林决定了这个国家的大部分特征。阿格拉隆是一个人类与他们的精灵和半精灵邻居和谐相处的王国，几个世纪以来，阿格拉隆一直是泰伊的敌人，部分原因是其前任统治者辛布的脾气。这个国家现在由一个辛巴奇委员会统治，该委员会已经从与泰伊的公开敌对行动中退缩。随着编织术的恢复，政治格局的不断变化，以及国家内部对精灵独立的呼声，目前还不清楚阿格拉隆德在一代人的时间里会是什么样的地方，只是它的巨大变化潜力将被实现。",
	"A collection of city-states bound by common culture and mutual defense, Chessenta isn't truly a nation. Each city boasts its own heroes, worships its own gladiatorial champions, and spends as much time insulting and competing with the other cities as it does on any other activity. The city of Luthcheq is dominated by worship of the bizarre deity known as Entropy, while Erebos is ruled by the latest incarnation of the red dragon known as Tchazzar the Undying. Heptios contains the largest library in Chessenta, a center of learning where all nobles aspire to send their children for tutoring. That city is looked on with disdain by the people of Akanax, whose militant contempt for the \"fat philosophers\" of Heptios is widely known. Toreus welcomes all visitors, even those from lands that are despised or mistrusted, and foreign coin can buy nearly anything there. The floating city of Airspur still flies somehow, its earthmotes unaffected by the fall of its fellows when the Sundering came to a close.": "Chessenta是一个由共同文化和共同防御所组成的城邦集合体，并不是一个真正的国家。每个城市都拥有自己的英雄，崇拜自己的角斗士冠军，花在侮辱和与其他城市竞争的时间和其他活动一样多。Luthcheq城被称为Entropy的怪异神灵的崇拜所支配，而Erebos则被称为不死的Tchazzar的红龙的最新化身所统治。Heptios有Chessenta最大的图书馆，是一个学习中心，所有贵族都渴望把他们的孩子送到这里来接受辅导。阿卡纳克斯的人对这座城市不屑一顾，他们对赫普提斯的 \"胖哲学家 \"的好战蔑视是众所周知的。托雷斯欢迎所有的游客，即使是那些来自被鄙视或不信任的国家的人，外国硬币几乎可以在那里买到任何东西。漂浮在空中的城市仍然在不知不觉中飞翔，它的地动仪并没有因其伙伴们的陨落而受到影响。",
	"For most folk in central Faerûn, the notion of a human kingdom is inextricably linked to Cormyr. A strong realm bolstered by its loyal army (the Purple Dragons), a cadre of magical defenders and investigators (the War Wizards), and numerous wealthy and influential nobles, Cormyr is recovering from its war with Sembia and Netheril—a conflict that cost the nation much, but left the kingdom standing, and which, in the end, Netheril didn't survive. The pride of that victory remains strong in Cormyr's collective consciousness, even as Queen Raedra draws back from plans to permanently welcome into the realm towns that lie beyond Cormyr's traditional borders.": "对于法鲁恩中部的大多数人来说，人类王国的概念与科米尔有着密不可分的联系。科米尔是一个强大的王国，由其忠诚的军队（紫龙）、魔法防御者和调查者（战争巫师）以及众多富有和有影响力的贵族支撑着，科米尔正在从与森比亚和尼瑟尔的战争中恢复过来--这场冲突让国家损失惨重，但却让王国屹立不倒，而且最终尼瑟尔也没能幸存。那场胜利的自豪感在Cormyr的集体意识中依然强烈，即使Raedra女王从永久欢迎Cormyr传统边界以外的城镇的计划中抽身出来。",
	"Cormyreans are justly proud of their homeland, and go to great lengths to guard it and its honor. Still, there is no shortage of danger in the Forest Kingdom, whether from scheming, treacherous nobles, monsters out of the Hullack Forest or the Stonelands, or some ancient, hidden magic. Cormyr is many things, but dull isn't one of them.": "科米雷人为自己的祖国感到自豪，并不遗余力地保护它和它的荣誉。尽管如此，森林王国仍然不乏危险，无论是来自阴险狡诈的贵族、来自胡拉克森林或石林的怪物，还是一些古老而隐秘的魔法。科米尔有很多东西，但沉闷并不是其中之一。",
	"The nations of Damara, Narfell, Sossal, and Vaasa, known collectively to most Faerûnians as the Cold Lands, rest near the Great Glacier in the cold, dry environs of the northeast.

	"In Damara, the usurper King Yarin Frostmantle sits on the throne of the Dragonbane dynasty, while his people complain about his tyranny and the growing threat from demons across the country. In Narfell, skilled riders and archers hunt, raid, and are gradually reclaiming their heritage as a great nation of mages who treated with devils. The Warlock Knights of Vaasa threaten to break the bounds of their nation and invade Damara, the Moonsea, or both, while some of its members suspiciously eye the ominously silent Castle Perilous, perhaps planning another excursion to the place. The tiny nation of Sossal trades with its neighbors, but shares little of itself with the wider world.": "在达玛拉，篡位者亚林-弗罗斯特曼特尔国王坐在龙渊王朝的宝座上，而他的人民则抱怨他的暴政和来自全国各地恶魔的日益严重的威胁。在纳菲尔，熟练的骑手和弓箭手在狩猎、突袭，并逐渐恢复了他们作为一个伟大的法师国家对待恶魔的传统。瓦萨的术士骑士团威胁要打破他们国家的界限，入侵达玛拉、月海或两者，而它的一些成员则怀疑地盯着不祥的沉默的危险城堡，也许在计划着对这个地方的另一次远足。索萨的小国与邻国进行贸易，但与更广泛的世界分享自己的东西很少。",
	"The humans who call the Dalelands home want nothing more than lives untroubled by the concerns of larger nations. They take great pride in their peaceful coexistence with the elves of Cormanthor, and in their ability to remain largely self-sufficient and autonomous even when their homeland was used as a battlefield by Cormyr, Netheril, Sembia, and Myth Drannor in the recent conflicts. Featherdale and Tasseldale have reasserted their independence since the end of the war, and rejoined Archendale, Battledale, Daggerdale, Deepingdale, Harrowdale, Mistledale, Scardale, and Shadowdale on the Dales Council. The High Dale did the same shortly afterward.": "以达利兰为家的人类只想过上不被大国所困扰的生活。他们对自己与科曼托尔的精灵和平共处感到非常自豪，也对自己在最近的冲突中被科米尔、尼瑟尔、森比亚和神话德兰诺用作战场时仍能基本保持自给自足和自主的能力感到骄傲。战争结束后，Featherdale和Tasseldale重新确立了他们的独立性，并重新加入了Archendale、Battledale、Daggerdale、Deepingdale、Harrowdale、Mistledale、Scardale和Shadowdale的Dales理事会。高山谷在不久之后也做了同样的事情。",

The dragonborn that have withdrawn to those areas have lost none of their military tradition, and their ability to hold this smaller amount of territory makes it unlikely that Unther will push farther any time soon—particularly since the Untherite navy has been unable to overcome the great beast that guards the harbor of Djerad Kethendi and the nearby waters of the Alamber.": "在过去的几十年里，龙裔的土地声称自己的领土是已经消失的Unther国家的一部分。然后，Unther在几年前突然回到了Faerûn，并迅速与Tymanther开战。此后，该王国主要沿着阿兰博海和灰烬湖的海岸缩减为小块土地。撤退到这些地区的龙族没有失去他们的军事传统，而他们守住这一小块领土的能力使得Unther不太可能在短期内向更远的地方推进--特别是Untherite的海军一直无法战胜守卫Djerad Kethendi港口和Alamber附近水域的巨兽。",

Under the leadership of this reincarnated god, the people of Unther rose up as an army to face their masters. On the eve of a great battle, the people of Unther were miraculously returned to their home, and Gilgeam wasted no time in leading them against the dragonborn occupying their ancestral lands. The Untherites have retaken much of the land they formerly held, while seeking to wipe out the \"godless lizards\" they blame for their time of oppression in Abeir.": "被困于另一个世界的Unther人已经屈服于他人的统治。后来在他们中间出现了一个自称吉尔吉安的人，他让他们想起了自己以前的伟大。在这位转世之神的领导下，Unther的人们组成了一支军队，面对他们的主人。在一场大战的前夕，Unther的人民奇迹般地回到了他们的家园，Gilgeam不失时机地带领他们对抗占据他们祖先土地的龙族。乌瑟人夺回了他们以前拥有的大部分土地，同时寻求消灭他们指责的 \"无神的蜥蜴\"，因为他们在阿比尔的时候受到了压迫。",
	"Gilgeam wants nothing short of a complete return to Unther's former glory. This achievement will require utterly destroying Tymanther, of course, and eventual war with Mulhorand to reclaim lands lost centuries ago, but as every Untherite knows, the great God-King is patient, for he is eternal.": "吉尔吉安想要的是完全恢复Unther以前的荣耀。当然，这一成就需要彻底摧毁泰曼瑟，并最终与穆尔霍兰开战，以夺回几个世纪前失去的土地，但正如每个Untherite人所知，伟大的神王是有耐心的，因为他是永恒的。",
	"The dismal city of Westgate isn't a romantic place, but someone seeking employment for shady work, or looking to hire someone for the same, will find few places better suited in all of Faerûn.": "阴暗的西门城并不是一个浪漫的地方，但如果有人想找一份阴暗的工作，或者想雇人做同样的工作，那么在整个法鲁恩，很少有地方比它更适合。",
	"Westgate is considered by some Faerûnians as a harbinger of the eventual fate of places like Amn and Sembia, where coin rules over all other considerations. As in many such places, one's moral outlook is less important in Westgate than one's attitude toward bribery. The city's proximity to Cormyr makes it a breeding ground for that nation's enemies, including the Fire Knives, a guild of thieves and assassins that the naive pretend doesn't exist.": "西门町被一些法鲁尼人认为是安恩和森比亚等地最终命运的预兆，在那里，钱币统治着所有其他的考虑。和许多这样的地方一样，在西门城，一个人的道德观不如他对贿赂的态度重要。这个城市靠近科米尔，这使它成为该国敌人的滋生地，包括火刀会，一个由小偷和刺客组成的行会，天真的人假装不存在。",
	"Far to the east, past the wastes of the Hordelands, lie the empires of Shou Lung, Kozakura, Wa, and the other lands of the vast continent of Kara-Tur. To most people of Faerûn, Kara-Tur is like another world, and the tales told by travelers from its nations seem to confirm it. The gods that humans worship in Faerûn are unknown there, as are common peoples such as gnomes and orcs. Other dragons, neither chromatic nor metallic, dwell in its lands and fly its skies. And its mages practice forms of magic mysterious even to archwizards of Faerûn.": "遥远的东方，经过Hordelands的荒原，是Shou Lung、Kozakura、Wa等帝国，以及Kara-Tur广大大陆的其他土地。对大多数法鲁恩人来说，卡拉图尔就像另一个世界，来自其国家的旅行者所讲述的故事似乎也证实了这一点。人类在法鲁恩崇拜的神灵在那里是不存在的，地精和兽人等普通民族也是如此。其他的龙，既不是彩色的也不是金属的，居住在它的土地上，在它的天空中飞翔。它的法师们修炼的魔法形式甚至对法鲁恩的大魔法师来说也很神秘。",
	"Stories of Kara-Tur tell of gold and jade in great abundance, rich spices, silks, and other goods rare or unknown in western lands—alongside tales of shapechanging spirit-people, horned giants, and nightmare monsters absent in Faerûn.": "卡拉图尔的故事讲述了大量的黄金和玉石、丰富的香料、丝绸和其他在西方土地上罕见或不为人知的商品--以及法鲁恩不存在的变形灵人、有角的巨人和噩梦般的怪物的故事。",
	"Far to the south of Faerûn, beyond Calimshan and even the jungles of Chult, are the Lands of Fate. Surrounded by waters thick with pirates and corsairs, Zakhara is a place less hospitable than most, but still braved by travelers who hope to profit from its exotic goods and strange magics. Like Kara-Tur, Zakhara seems a world away to Faerûnians. It is thought of as a vast desert, sprinkled with glittering cities like scattered gems. Romantic tales abound of scimitar-wielding rogues riding flying carpets and of genies bound in service to humans. Their mages, called sha'ir, practice their magic with the aid of genies and, it is said, might carry the lineage of these elemental beings in their blood.": "在法鲁恩的南部，在卡里姆山甚至楚尔特的丛林之外，是命运之域。扎哈拉被海盗和骑兵包围着，是一个不那么好客的地方，但仍有希望从其异国货物和奇怪的魔法中获利的旅行者勇敢面对。与卡拉图尔一样，扎哈拉对法鲁尼人来说似乎是一个世界。它被认为是一个巨大的沙漠，散布着像散落的宝石一样闪亮的城市。挥舞着弯刀的流氓骑着飞毯的浪漫故事比比皆是，还有为人类服务的精灵。他们的法师被称为sha'ir，在精灵的帮助下练习他们的魔法，据说他们的血液中可能带有这些元素生物的血统。",
	"Farther to the west, past even Evermeet, are untold, unknown lands beyond the Trackless Sea. Many explorers have visited such lands, and some have even returned, bearing tales that change from generation to generation about exotic locales, from island chains that are the sites of countless shipwrecks, to fearsome feather-clad warriors, and vast continents that suddenly appeared where nothing—or something very much different—had rested only seasons prior.": "在西部更远的地方，甚至超过了Evermeet，是无轨之海以外不为人知的未知土地。许多探险家曾访问过这些土地，有些人甚至回来了，带着关于异国情调的故事，从无数沉船的岛链，到可怕的羽衣武士，以及突然出现的广阔大陆，而在此前的几个季节里，那里什么都没有，或者有非常不同的东西。",
	"Nearly every major power of Faerûn has its own currency: coins minted within its borders that represent both its influence and material wealth. Most coins of pure composition and standard weight are accepted at face value across the continent, though not every city-state or nation bothers to mint every sort of coin.": "几乎每个法鲁恩的大国都有自己的货币：在其境内铸造的钱币，代表其影响力和物质财富。大多数成分纯正、重量标准的硬币在整个大陆都被接受为面值，尽管不是每个城邦或国家都愿意铸造各种硬币。",
	"Some of the most commonly found, and widely accepted, currency in the Realms is summarized below. Each grouping is arranged in order of value: copper, silver, electrum, gold, and (when present) platinum. Most people across Faerûn refer to coins by whatever name the issuing government uses, regardless of origin, except for Zhentil Keep—for some reason, all Zhent coins have unflattering epithets associated with them.": "下面总结了一些在王国中最常见的、被广泛接受的货币。每组货币按价值顺序排列：铜、银、电子货币、金和（如果有）白金。整个法鲁恩的大多数人都以发行政府使用的任何名称来称呼硬币，而不考虑其来源，但赞特尔堡除外--出于某种原因，所有赞特的硬币都有与之相关的不光彩的外号。",
	"fander, taran, centaur, danter, roldon": "Fander, Taran, centaur, danter, roldon",
	"thumb, falcon, blue eye, golden lion, tricrown": "拇指、猎鹰、蓝眼、金狮、三叉戟",
	"steelpence (an iron coin), hawk, blue eye, noble": "钢便士（一种铁币）、鹰、蓝眼睛、贵族",

	"Silverymoon also mints two special coins: the moon and the eclipsed moon. The moon is a crescent-shaped, shining blue coin of electrum, valued at 2 unicorns in Silverymoon and nearby settlements, and 1 unicorn everywhere else. The eclipsed moon stamps an electrum moon with a darker silver wedge to complete a round coin. It is worth 5 unicorns within the city, but only 2 unicorns elsewhere.": "银月城还铸造了两种特殊的硬币：月亮和黯淡的月亮。月亮是一种月牙形的、闪亮的蓝色电子币，在银月城和附近的定居点价值2个独角兽，在其他地方价值1个独角兽。黯然失色的月亮盖上了一个带有暗银楔子的电子货币，以完成一个圆形的硬币。它在城市内价值5个独角兽，但在其他地方只有2个独角兽。",
	"Waterdeep has its own coins. The taol is a square piece of brass, worth 2 dragons in the city—and virtually worthless to anyone not trading with Waterdeep. Most traders exchange their taols for standard coins before traveling. The \"harbor moon\" is a palm-sized crescent of platinum inset with electrum, and is worth 50 dragons in the city, 30 dragons elsewhere. Its name comes from its common use in buying large amounts of cargo. Both taols and harbor moons are pierced to enable the bearer to string multiple coins together.": "沃特德普有自己的钱币。taol是一块方形的黄铜，在城市中价值2龙--对于不与沃特德普进行贸易的人来说几乎没有价值。大多数商人在旅行前都会把他们的taol换成标准硬币。港湾之月 \"是一个手掌大小的铂金月牙，上面镶嵌有电子，在城市里价值50龙，在其他地方价值30龙。它的名字来自于它在购买大量货物时的普遍使用。taols和海港之月都有穿孔，使持有者能够将多个硬币串在一起。",
	"Baldur's Gate sets the standard for minting trade bars—ingots of metal (usually silver) of an accepted size and weight used in lieu of great piles of coins or gems for larger transactions. The most common such trade bar is a 5-pound bar 6 inches long, 2 inches wide, and 1 inch thick, valued at 25 gp.": "博德之门制定了铸造贸易条的标准--在大型交易中用来代替大堆硬币或宝石的可接受的金属（通常是银）。最常见的贸易条是一根5磅重的条子，长6英寸，宽2英寸，厚1英寸，价值25金币。",
	"Although a number of means exist for marking the days and the passage of time during a year, nearly all folk in Faerûn have adopted the Calendar of Harptos. Even the cultures and races that don't favor this method of marking time are aware of it, with the result that it is recognized across nearly all races, languages, and cultures.": "虽然有许多方法来标记一年中的日子和时间的流逝，但法鲁恩几乎所有的人都采用了《哈普托斯日历》。即使是那些不喜欢这种标记时间方法的文化和种族也知道这种方法，其结果是几乎所有的种族、语言和文化都认可它。",
	"A year on Toril consists of 365 days. In the Calendar of Harptos, the year is divided into twelve months of thirty days, loosely following the synodic cycle of Selûne, the moon. A month is made up of three tendays, also known as rides. Five annual holidays, falling between the months, complete the 365-day calendar. Once every four years, the Calendar of Harptos includes Shieldmeet as a \"leap day\" following Midsummer.": "托里尔的一年由365天组成。在哈普托斯历法中，一年被分为12个月，每30天，松散地遵循月亮塞卢恩的同步周期。一个月由三个工作日组成，也被称为骑行。在各月之间有五个年度假期，完成了365天的日历。每四年一次，《哈普托斯日历》中包括仲夏节之后的 \"闰日\"，即Shieldmeet。",
	"Individual days of a tenday have no special names. Instead, they are denoted by counting from the beginning of the period (\"first day,\" \"second day,\" and so on). Days of the month are designated by a number and the month name. For example, sages would record an event as occurring on \"1 Mirtul\" or \"27 Uktar.\" People might also refer to a given day by its relationship to the current date (\"two tendays from today\") or the nearest holiday (\"three days past Greengrass\").": "一个工作日中的各个日子没有特殊的名称。取而代之的是，它们通过从时期的开始计算来表示（\"第一天\"、\"第二天\"，等等）。每月的日子由数字和月份名称来表示。例如，圣人会记录一个事件发生在 \"1 Mirtul \"或 \"27 Uktar\"。人们也可以通过它与当前日期的关系（\"从今天起的两天\"）或最近的节日（\"格林格拉斯过去三天\"）来指代某一天。",
	"Every nation, faith, and culture across Faerûn has its own special festivals and holidays, the observances of which are governed by the cycles of the sun, the moon, the stars, or some other event. In addition, the Calendar of Harptos specifies five annual festivals keyed to the changing of the seasons and one quadrennial festival that are observed in almost every land, with particular celebrations varying based on local traditions and popular faiths.": "法鲁恩的每个国家、信仰和文化都有自己的特殊节日和假期，其庆祝活动受太阳、月亮、星星或其他事件的周期所支配。此外，《哈普托斯日历》规定了五个与季节变化相关的年度节日和一个四年一度的节日，几乎每个国家都会庆祝这些节日，具体的庆祝活动因当地的传统和流行的信仰而不同。",
	"The first festival day of the year is known generally as Midwinter, though some people name it differently. Nobles and monarchs of the Heartlands look to the High Festival of Winter as a day to commemorate or renew alliances. Commoners in the North, the Moonsea, and other, colder climes celebrate Deadwinter Day as a marking of the midpoint of the cold season, with hard times still ahead, but some of the worst days now past.": "一年中的第一个节日一般被称为中冬节，尽管有些人对它有不同的称呼。心脏地带的贵族和君主们将冬季高级节视为纪念或更新联盟的日子。北方、月海和其他更寒冷地区的平民庆祝死冬节，作为寒冷季节中点的标志，困难时期仍在前方，但一些最糟糕的日子已经过去。",
	"The traditional beginning of spring, Greengrass is celebrated by the display of freshly cut flowers (grown in special hothouses wherever the climate doesn't permit flowers so early) that are given as gifts to the gods or spread among the fields in hopes of a bountiful and speedy growing season.": "绿草是春天的传统开端，人们通过展示新鲜的切花（在气候不允许这么早开花的地方，在特殊的暖房里种植）来庆祝，这些花被作为礼物送给神灵，或在田野里散布，希望有一个丰收和快速的生长季节。",
	"The midpoint of summer is a day of feasting, carousing, betrothals, and basking in the pleasant weather. Storms on Midsummer night are seen as bad omens and signs of ill fortune, and sometimes interpreted as divine disapproval of the romances or marriages sparked by the day's events.": "夏天的中点是盛宴、狂欢、订婚和沐浴在愉快天气中的日子。仲夏夜的风暴被视为坏兆头和不吉利的征兆，有时也被解释为神对这一天的事件所引发的浪漫或婚姻的不认可。",
	"The great holiday of the Calendar of Harptos, Shieldmeet occurs once every four years immediately after Midsummer. It is a day for plain speaking and open council between rulers and their subjects, for the renewal of pacts and contracts, and for treaty making between peoples. Many tournaments and contests of skill are held on Shieldmeet, and most faiths mark the holiday by emphasizing one of their key tenets.": "Shieldmeet是哈普托斯历法中的重要节日，每四年一次，紧随仲夏节之后。在这一天，统治者和他们的臣民之间可以畅所欲言，公开讨论，续订盟约和合同，以及人民之间签订条约。在Shieldmeet上会举行许多锦标赛和技能竞赛，大多数信仰都会通过强调其关键信条之一来纪念这个节日。",
	"The next Shieldmeet will be observed in 1492 DR.": "下一次Shieldmeet将在1492年举行。",
	"A day of feasting and thanks, Highharvestide marks the fall harvest. Most humans give thanks to Chauntea on this day for a plentiful bounty before winter approaches. Many who make their living by traveling road or sea set out immediately following the holiday, before winter comes on in full force and blocks mountain passes and harbors.": "这是一个充满盛宴和感谢的日子，Highharvestide标志着秋季的收获。大多数人在这一天向Chauntea表示感谢，感谢它在冬天来临之前提供了丰厚的赏赐。许多以公路或海上旅行为生的人在节日过后立即出发，赶在冬季全面到来之前，封锁山路和港口。",
	"As nights lengthen and winter winds begin to approach, the Feast of the Moon is the time when people celebrate their ancestors and their honored dead. During festivals on this day, people gather to share stories and legends, offer prayers for the fallen, and prepare for the coming cold.": "随着夜晚的延长和冬风的来临，月亮节是人们庆祝他们的祖先和受尊敬的死者的时候。在这一天的节日里，人们聚集在一起分享故事和传说，为死去的人祈祷，并为即将到来的寒冷做准备。",
	"Most people don't keep track of the time of day beyond notions such as \"mid-morning\" or \"nigh sunset.\" If people plan to meet at a particular time, they tend to base their arrangements around such expressions.": "大多数人除了 \"上午时分 \"或 \"日落时分 \"这样的概念外，并不记录一天的时间。如果人们计划在一个特定的时间见面，他们往往会围绕这样的表达方式进行安排。",
	"The concept of hours and minutes exists mainly where wealthy people use clocks, but mechanical clocks are often unreliable, and rarely are two set to the same time. If a local temple or civic structure has a clock that tolls out the passing of the hours, people refer to hours as \"bells,\" as in \"I'll meet you at seven bells.\"": "小时和分钟的概念主要存在于有钱人使用时钟的地方，但机械钟往往不可靠，而且很少有两个钟调到同一时间。如果当地的寺庙或市政建筑有一个钟，可以报出小时的流逝，人们就把小时称为 \"钟\"，如 \"我在七点钟声中与你见面\"。",
	"The worlds of Abeir and Toril drifted apart in 1487 and 1488 DR. In some places this change was accompanied by cataclysm, while in others the shift went without notice. Astronomers and navigators who closely watched the stars couldn't fail to see that there were nights when they seemed to hang in the sky. The winter of 1487-1488 lasted longer than normal. It was then noted that the solstices and equinoxes had somehow shifted, beginning with the spring equinox falling on Greengrass of 1488 DR. The seasons followed suit, with each starting later and ending later. ": "阿拜尔和托里尔的世界在公元1487年和1488年渐行渐远。在一些地方，这种变化伴随着大灾难，而在另一些地方，这种转变没有引起注意。仔细观察星星的天文学家和航海家们不能不看到，有一些夜晚，它们似乎被悬挂在天空中。1487-1488年的冬天持续的时间比正常时间长。然后人们注意到，至点和分点不知为何发生了变化，从公元1488年的春分落在绿草地上开始。季节也紧随其后，每个季节的开始和结束都比较晚。",
	"This shift in seasons has caused some sages, and the priests of Chauntea, to consider changing the marking of some of the annual feast days, but most folk counsel patience, believing that the seasons will fall back to their previous cycle over the coming years. ": "季节的转变使一些圣人和Chauntea的祭司考虑改变一些年度节庆日的标记，但大多数人建议耐心等待，相信季节会在未来几年内恢复到以前的周期。",

	"Tens of thousands of years ago, empires of reptilian, amphibian, and avian peoples—known in Elvish as Iqua'Tel'Quessir, the creator races—dominated the world.

	"The age of the creator races came to a sudden end some thirty thousand years ago. Perhaps their wars reached a terrible and inevitable crescendo, or they tampered with forbidden forces.

	"Thousands of years after the rise of the great elven nations, hundreds of elf high mages united to cast a spell intended to create a glorious homeland for their race. The spell succeeded, but it rippled backward and forward in time, and the land was sundered, changing the face of the world. The largest continent of this new world is now called Faerûn. Far from its western shores rose the isle of Evermeet, considered a part of Arvandor, the home of the elven gods on the plane of Arborea, and a bridge between worlds.": "在伟大的精灵国家崛起的数千年后，数百名精灵高级法师联合起来施展法术，旨在为他们的种族创造一个光荣的家园。咒语成功了，但它在时间上向后和向前荡漾，土地被分割，改变了世界的面貌。这个新世界中最大的大陆现在被称为Faerûn。在它的西海岸远处升起了Evermeet岛，它被认为是Arvandor的一部分，是Arborea平面上精灵诸神的家园，是世界之间的桥梁。",
	"Some thirteen thousand years ago, war broke out between the elven nations of Aryvandaar and Miyeritar, beginning a series of conflicts known as the Crown Wars.

	"More than five thousand years ago, a group of human fishing villages on the shores of the Narrow Sea joined under the rule of the shaman-king Nether, becoming known as the empire of Netheril. The Netherese learned the use of magic from the Eaerlanni elves and became renowned wizards. Centuries later, they discovered the arcane texts known as the Nether Scrolls in the ruins of Aryvandaar and subsequently abandoned the practices of the Eaerlanni in order to procure even greater magical power.": "五千多年前，狭海岸边的一群人类渔村在萨满王尼瑟的统治下联合起来，成为著名的尼瑟尔帝国。尼瑟尔人从Eaerlanni精灵那里学会了魔法的使用，并成为著名的巫师。几个世纪后，他们在Aryvandaar的废墟中发现了被称为尼瑟尔卷轴的神秘文本，随后放弃了Eaerlanni的做法，以获得更大的魔法力量。",
	"Netheril grew to become an invincible nation of magic and wonders, dominating much of the North for three thousand years. Then the power-mad Netherese arcanist Karsus attempted to usurp the role of the goddess of magic. The resulting disruption in the fabric of magic sent Netheril's floating cities crashing to the ground, destroyed a host of other wards and enchantments, and brought about the end of the great empire.": "尼瑟尔成长为一个无敌的魔法和奇迹之国，统治北方大部分地区达三千年之久。然后，狂热的尼瑟尔奥术师Karsus试图篡夺魔法女神的地位。由此产生的对魔法结构的破坏使尼瑟尔的浮空城市坠落到地面上，摧毁了大量其他的守护和魔法，并带来了这个伟大帝国的终结。",
	"In the decades and centuries following the collapse of Netheril, many cities of the Sword Coast and the North, such as Illusk and Citadel Sundbarr, took in refugees from the fallen empire, and new settlements made up entirely or primarily of human survivors from Netheril and their descendants were established throughout the North and in the Western Heartlands.": "在尼瑟尔崩溃后的几十年和几个世纪里，剑海岸和北方的许多城市，如伊鲁斯克和桑德巴尔城堡，接纳了来自堕落帝国的难民，在整个北方和西部中心地带建立了完全或主要由尼瑟尔的人类幸存者及其后代组成的新定居点。",
	"Nearly fifteen hundred years ago, the human settlers of the Dalelands and the elves of Cormanthor pledged their alliance in an agreement known as the Dales Compact. A monument called the Standing Stone was erected to mark the occasion, and the advent of Dalereckoning was decreed, beginning with the year 1 DR. This method of numbering the years in Toril's history has spread across Faerûn and is commonly understood (if not universally accepted).": "近一千五百年前，达利兰的人类定居者和科曼托的精灵在一份被称为 \"达利斯契约 \"的协议中宣誓结盟。一座被称为 \"站立石 \"的纪念碑被竖立起来以示纪念，达勒克宁的出现也被确定下来，从1DR年开始。这种对托里尔历史上的年份进行编号的方法已经传遍了整个法鲁恩，并且被普遍理解（即使不是普遍接受）。",
	"The city of Neverwinter—called Eigersstor when it was a mere settlement—was founded in 87 DR. On the banks of the River Raurin, the humble community of Silverymoon Ford came into being in 384 DR, and less than two centuries later it had grown to become the city of Silverymoon.": "永夜城在87年成立，当时它还只是一个定居点，被称为艾格斯托（Eigersstor）。在劳林河畔，卑微的银月福特社区于384 DR成立，不到两个世纪后，它已经发展成为银月城。",
	"In 882 DR, a village and trading post on the shore of a deep bay in the shadow of a great mountain was named Nimoar's Hold, after the Uthgardt chieftain who claimed the area and fortified it. The place became known to sea captains as \"Waterdeep,\" a name that displaced the original within a few generations. In 1032 DR, Ahghairon, heir to the arts of Netheril, saved the city from itself by unseating Waterdeep's warlord and would-be emperor, Raurlor. Ahghairon declared that wisdom, not strength of arms, would rule in the city from now on, and created the Lords of Waterdeep.": "公元882年，在一座大山阴影下的深湾岸边，有一个村庄和贸易站被命名为 \"尼莫尔之地\"，这是以声称拥有该地区并在此设防的乌斯加特酋长命名的。这个地方被船长们称为 \"沃特德普\"，这个名字在几代人的时间里就取代了原来的名字。公元1032年，Netheril艺术的继承人Ahghairon击败了Waterdeep的军阀和未来的皇帝Raurlor，从而拯救了这座城市的命运。阿格海龙宣布，从现在开始，智慧而非武力将统治这座城市，并创建了沃特德普的领主。",
	"These and other nations and great city-states rose to prominence along the Sword Coast, forming a chain along the Trade Way from Illusk in the far north to Baldur's Gate in the south, near the borders of Amn. Like their elven and dwarven predecessors, they fought off attacks by savage humanoids, including orc hordes from the Spine of the World. Waterdeep, guided by its mysterious Lords, became a rising power, while old Illusk fell to the orcs for decades, until it was eventually reclaimed and the city of Luskan built upon its ruins.": "这些国家和其他国家以及伟大的城邦沿着剑海岸崛起，沿着贸易之路形成了一条链条，从最北边的伊鲁斯克到南边的博德之门，靠近安恩的边界。像他们的精灵和矮人前辈一样，他们抵御了野蛮的人类攻击，包括来自世界之脊的兽人群。沃特迪普在其神秘领主的指引下，成为了一个崛起的大国，而古老的伊拉斯克则在数十年间沦为兽人的天下，直到它最终被收复，并在其废墟上建立了卢斯坎城。",
	"The four and a half centuries since the establishment of the Lords of Waterdeep have been tumultuous times for the Sword Coast and the world. Throughout this period, civilization struggles against the savage forces of chaos, and life attempts to persevere against the agents of death and strife, sometimes in places where even the gods themselves have not been exempt from destruction.": "自沃特德普领主建立以来的四个半世纪，对剑海岸和世界来说都是动荡不安的时代。在这一时期，文明与野蛮的混乱力量进行着斗争，生命试图在死亡和纷争的代理人面前坚持下去，有时在一些地方，甚至连神明本身都无法免于毁灭。",
	"The last one hundred fifty years have comprised one of the most cataclysmic periods in Faerûn's history. On no fewer than three occasions, Toril has been shaken to its core by forces that have repeatedly rewritten the laws of reality.": "过去的150年是法鲁恩历史上最严重的灾难性时期之一。在不少于三次的事件中，托里尔被反复改写现实法则的力量撼动了其核心。",
	"In 1358 DR, the gods were cast out of their otherworldly domain and made to wander the land incarnated as mortals. In seeking to recover their divinity, they warred among themselves. Magic became unpredictable, and the prayers of the faithful went unanswered. Some of the gods-turned-mortal were slain, while a handful of mortals ascended to godhood, assuming the responsibilities of the dead deities.": "公元1358年，众神被赶出了他们的异世界领域，并被迫化身为凡人在陆地上游荡。为了寻求恢复他们的神性，他们之间发生了战争。魔法变得不可预测，而信徒们的祈祷也得不到回应。一些变成了神的人被杀了，而少数凡人则升为神，承担起死去的神的责任。",
	"In 1374 DR, the Empire of Netheril rose again when the floating city of Thultanthar, commonly known as Shade, returned from a nearly two-thousand-year-long excursion in the Shadowfell, to hover above the Anauroch desert. The shadow-touched nobles of the city almost immediately began hunting for ancient Netherese ruins and artifacts and preparing for a restoration of their once-great empire.": "公元1374年，尼瑟尔帝国再次崛起，这时Thultanthar浮空城，俗称Shade，从长达近两千年的暗影城游历回来，盘旋在Anauroch沙漠之上。被阴影触及的城市贵族们几乎立即开始猎取古代尼瑟斯的遗迹和文物，并准备恢复他们曾经的伟大帝国。",
	"In 1385 DR, the ascended deity Cyric, aided by Shar, murdered Mystra, the goddess of magic, in her domain of Dweomerheart. This act ripped asunder the fabric of magic in the world, unleashing its raw power in a catastrophe called the Spellplague. Thousands of practitioners of the Art were driven mad or killed, while the face of Faerûn was reshaped by waves and veils of mystic blue fire. Entire nations were displaced or exchanged with realms from other worlds, and parts of the earth were torn free to float in the air.": "在公元1385年，升天的神灵西里克在沙尔的帮助下，在她的领地Dweomerheart谋杀了魔法女神Mystra。这一行为撕裂了世界上的魔法结构，在一场被称为 \"法术瘟疫 \"的灾难中释放了其原始力量。成千上万的魔法从业者被逼疯或杀死，而法鲁恩的面貌被神秘的蓝色火焰的波浪和面纱所重塑。整个国家被迁移或与其他世界的王国交换，地球的一部分被撕开，漂浮在空中。",
	"A century after the Spellplague, the lands and peoples of Faerûn had become accustomed to the state of things—just in time for everything to change again.": "咒语之灾后的一个世纪，法鲁恩的土地和人民已经习惯了事物的状态--正好赶上一切再次改变。",
	"The first indication of new turmoil came in 1482 DR, when Bhaal, the long-dead god of murder, was reborn in Baldur's Gate amid chaos and bloodshed, leaving two of the city's dukes and many of its citizens dead. The return of Bhaal and his apparent reclamation of the domain of murder from Cyric led some scholars and sages to believe that the rules by which all deities must abide were in flux.": "新的动荡的第一个迹象出现在公元1482年，当时已经死去多年的谋杀之神Bhaal在混乱和血腥中重生在Baldur's Gate，导致该城的两位公爵和许多市民死亡。Bhaal的回归以及他显然从Cyric手中夺回了谋杀领域，导致一些学者和圣人认为，所有神灵必须遵守的规则正在发生变化。",
	"In 1484, strange calamities began to occur throughout Faerûn. An earthquake struck Iriaebor. A plague of locusts afflicted Amn. Droughts gripped the southern lands as the sea steadily receded in places. Amid this tumult, conflict broke out in many regions of the continent. The orcs of Many-Arrows warred against the dwarfholds of the North and their allies. Sembia invaded the Dalelands, and Cormyr raised an army to come to the aid of the Dalesfolk. Netheril brought forces to Cormyr's border, and Cormyr was drawn into a war on both fronts.": "1484年，整个Faerûn开始发生奇怪的灾难。一场地震袭击了Iriaebor。蝗虫之灾困扰着安恩。南方的土地上出现了干旱，海水在一些地方不断地退去。在这种动荡中，大陆的许多地区都爆发了冲突。许多箭头的兽人与北方的矮人家庭及其盟友开战。森比亚（Sembia）入侵达利兰（Dalelands），科米尔（Cormyr）组建了一支军队来援助达利兰人。尼瑟尔（Netheril）将军队带到了科米尔的边境，科米尔被卷入了一场两线作战的战争。",
	"Throughout this period, tales began to spread of individuals who had been touched by the gods and granted strange powers. Some of these so-called Chosen were at the root of the conflicts that grip the land. Some seemed driven by divine purpose, while others claimed to be mystified as to why they would be singled out.": "在整个这一时期，关于被神灵触及并被赋予奇怪力量的人的故事开始传播。这些所谓的神选者中的一些人是困扰这片土地的冲突的根源。有些人似乎是被神圣的目的所驱使，而其他人则声称对他们为什么会被选中感到神秘。",
	"In 1485, in Icewind Dale, the Chosen of Auril foments war with Ten-Towns and was defeated. In Anauroch, seeing that Netherese forces were spread thin, the long-subjugated Bedine people rebelled. Having defeated or besieged the dwarfholds of the North, orcs march on Silverymoon. In Cormyr and Sembia, the Netherese and the Cormyreans traded ground, while the Dalelands became a war zone. As if to offset the drought in the south, in the autumn of 1485 the Great Rain began to fall around the Sea of Fallen Stars and continued unceasingly.": "1485年，在冰风谷，奥里尔的神选者与十方镇挑起战争并被击败。在阿诺罗奇，看到尼瑟斯的部队被分散，长期被奴役的贝丁人反叛了。在击败或围困了北方的矮人家庭后，兽人向银月城进军。在科米尔（Cormyr）和森比亚（Sembia），尼德勒人和科米勒人交换地盘，而达利兰（Dalelands）则成了一个战区。仿佛是为了抵消南方的干旱，1485年秋天，大雨开始在堕星海周围落下，并持续不断。",
	"While the waters rose to the east in early 1486, the tide turned against the orcs in the North, and by the end of the year their armies were broken and scattered. Also during that year, the elves of Myth Drannor came to the aid of the Dalelands and helped push back Sembian forces. On the Sword Coast, the Hosttower of the Arcane rose again in Luskan, along with the Arcane Brotherhood. In Waterdeep and Neverwinter, efforts were made to clear those cities of century-old rubble and neglect. Cormyr repulsed the last of the Sembian and Netherese forces from the nation, reclaiming its territory, and recalled its forces, turning inward to address issues of rebuilding.": "在1486年初水涨船高的同时，北方的兽人也转危为安，到了年底，他们的军队被击溃并分散了。也是在这一年，神话德兰诺（Myth Drannor）的精灵们来到了达利兰（Dalelands）的帮助下，帮助击退了森比亚的军队。在剑海岸，奥术师的主塔和奥术师兄弟会一起在卢斯坎再次崛起。在沃特迪普（Waterdeep）和永夜（Neverwinter），人们努力清除这些城市的百年废墟和荒废。科米尔击退了最后的森比亚和尼瑟斯部队，收回了自己的领土，并召回了自己的部队，转向内部解决重建问题。",
	"Late in 1486, the Great Rain finally abated, but this event didn't signify an end to the chaos. The Sea of Fallen Stars had grown, submerging great swaths of land beneath its waves.": "1486年晚些时候，大雨终于减弱，但这一事件并不意味着混乱的结束。堕星之海不断扩大，将大片土地淹没在其波浪之下。",
	"Early in 1487, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions abounded for months, as if the whole world was convulsing. Rumors spread of chasms caused by the Spellplague suddenly vanishing, and stories circulated of known destinations being farther away from one another, as if the world had quietly added miles of wilderness to the distance between them. Word began to spread of places and peoples not heard from since the Spellplague. It became apparent that some of the effects of that terrible time had been reversed. During the year, ships claiming to be from Evermeet, Lantan, and Nimbral—nations thought vanished or destroyed-sailed into ports on the Sword Coast and in the Shining South. Tales spread of the legendary skyships of Halruaa being spotted in southern skies. No longer engaged in Cormyr, Netheril attacked Myth Drannor by floating the City of Shade over it. In a struggle for control of Myth Drannor's mythal and the Weave itself, the flying capital of Netheril was brought crashing down on Myth Drannor, resulting in the cataclysmic destruction of both.": "1487年初，地震和火山爆发接连发生了几个月，仿佛整个世界都在抽搐。咒语瘟疫造成的裂缝突然消失的传闻也在流传，已知的目的地彼此之间的距离越来越远，仿佛世界悄悄地在它们之间增加了几英里的荒野。自法术瘟疫以来没有听说过的地方和民族的消息开始传播。很明显，那个可怕时期的一些影响已经被逆转。在这一年里，自称来自埃弗米特、兰坦和宁布拉的船只--这些被认为已经消失或被摧毁的国家--驶入了剑海岸和闪耀南方的港口。在南方的天空中发现了传说中的Halruaa天船的故事。Netheril不再参与Cormyr，而是通过在Myth Drannor上空漂浮阴影之城来攻击它。在一场争夺神话德兰诺的神话和编织本身的斗争中，尼瑟尔的飞行首都被撞到了神话德兰诺，导致两者的灾难性毁灭。",
	"As the year drew to a close, there were nights when the heavens seemed to hang motionless. Throughout much of Faerûn, the winter of 1487 and 1488 lasted longer than any on record. The solstices and equinoxes had somehow drifted. Later seasons followed suit, with each starting and ending later than expected. Prayers to the gods for knowledge and mercy seemed to go unacknowledged, apart from the presence of their Chosen.": "当这一年接近尾声时，有几个夜晚，天空似乎一动不动。在Faerûn的大部分地区，1487年和1488年的冬天比任何记录都要长。至点和分点不知不觉地漂移了。后来的季节也是如此，每个季节的开始和结束都比预期的晚。除了神选者的出现，向诸神祈求知识和仁慈的祈祷似乎没有得到承认。",
	"Although the orcs were defeated in the North, the League of Silver Marches was disbanded in 1488, as former allies blamed one another for failures in the war. Sembia divided into separate city-states only nominally allied with one another. While a handful of settlements survived, the Netherese Empire was no more. The remainder of the Netherese forces battle with the Bedine over control of the Memory Spire, thought to be a tomb of the phaerimm, Netheril's ancient enemies. The battle awakens what turns out to be a hive of the creatures, and they use the life and magic-draining power of the spire against the lands below.": "虽然兽人在北方被打败了，但银色马奇联盟在1488年解散了，因为以前的盟友为战争的失败互相指责。森比亚分裂成独立的城邦，只是在名义上相互结盟。虽然有少数定居点幸存下来，但尼德兰帝国已不复存在。剩余的尼瑟斯部队与贝丁人争夺记忆之塔的控制权，该塔被认为是尼瑟斯的古代敌人辉瑞姆的坟墓。这场战斗唤醒了那些被证明是蜂巢的生物，它们利用尖塔的生命和魔法消耗的力量来对付下面的土地。",
	"By 1489, many of the wars that began during the Sundering had ground to a close. Other conflicts arose, and mighty threats still imperiled the world, but the deities ceased interfering with the world through their Chosen. The gods were no longer silent but quiet, and in many places new priesthoods arose to interpret the gods' now subtle signs.": "到了1489年，许多在分裂时期开始的战争已经结束了。其他的冲突出现了，强大的威胁仍然威胁着这个世界，但神灵不再通过他们的神选者干预这个世界了。众神不再沉默而是安静，在许多地方出现了新的神职来解释众神现在微妙的迹象。",
	"The world today seems a place filled with new lands and opportunities, where those who dare can leave their mark. Students of history and those elves and dwarves who recall the past that short-lived humans see as distant perceive a world much like it was over a century ago. For most folk, wild tales of people empowered by the gods, and of far-off lands returned to the world, are the subjects of fireside chatter. Daily concerns and the dangers and opportunities just beyond their doors take precedence, and plenty of both remain on the Sword Coast and in the North.": "今天的世界似乎是一个充满新土地和机会的地方，在那里，那些有胆量的人可以留下他们的印记。研究历史的学生和那些回忆起被短命的人类视为遥远的过去的精灵和矮人，感知到的世界与一个多世纪前的世界很相似。对大多数人来说，被神赋予权力的人的疯狂故事，以及回归世界的遥远土地，是炉边谈话的主题。日常事务以及门外的危险和机会才是最重要的，而在剑海岸和北方，这两方面的问题都很多。",
	"From the simplest cantrip to the mightiest workings of High Magic, from the blessings of healing mercy to the raising of mighty heroes from the dead, magic permeates the Realms. Any understanding of magic begins, and ends, with an understanding of the Weave.": "从最简单的咒语到最强大的高级魔法，从治愈的仁慈的祝福到让强大的英雄起死回生，魔法渗透到了整个王国。对魔法的任何理解都以对 \"编织 \"的理解为起点和终点。",
	"The Weave is an essential element of the universe, running through everything in unseen threads. Some creatures, objects, and locations have deep, intrinsic ties to the Weave and can perform extraordinary feats that come naturally to them (a beholder's flight, a vampire's charming gaze, a dragon's breath weapon, and so forth). Creatures with the necessary talent and skill can also manipulate the Weave to perform magic by casting spells.": "编织是宇宙的一个基本元素，以看不见的线贯穿一切。一些生物、物体和地点与 \"编织 \"有着深厚的内在联系，可以自然而然地完成非凡的壮举（看客的飞行、吸血鬼的迷人目光、龙的呼吸武器，等等）。具有必要天赋和技能的生物也可以通过施法来操纵织网来施展魔法。",
	"The Weave isn't normally visible or detectable, even through the use of spells. Detect magic doesn't let you perceive the Weave, for instance. The Weave isn't magic, precisely, any more than a collection of threads is a garment; it's the raw material from which the tapestry of magic is woven.": "织网通常是不可见的，也无法探测，即使是通过使用法术。例如，探测魔法不能让你感知到 \"编织\"。准确地说，\"编织 \"不是魔法，就像一堆线头是一件衣服一样；它是编织魔法织锦的原材料。",
	"In two senses, both the metaphorical and the real, the goddess Mystra is the Weave. She is its keeper and tender, but all three times the goddess of magic has died or been separated from her divinity (twice as Mystra, and once as her predecessor, Mystryl), magic has been twisted or has failed entirely. With Mystra's last death and the coming of the Spellplague, the Weave was thought destroyed, and the term lost its significance. Since the end of the most recent Sundering, both Mystra and the Weave have returned to their roles of centuries past, and spells and magic items are more reliable than they had been while the Spellplague raged.": "在两种意义上，无论是隐喻的还是现实的，女神Mystra都是织布。她是它的守护者和温柔者，但在这位魔法女神死亡或与她的神性分离的所有三次中（两次作为Mystra，一次作为她的前任Mystryl），魔法都被扭曲或完全失败。随着神秘拉的最后一次死亡和法术瘟疫的到来，编织被认为被摧毁了，这个词也失去了它的意义。自从最近一次混乱结束后，Mystra和 \"织网 \"都回到了他们几个世纪前的角色，法术和魔法物品也比法术瘟疫肆虐时更加可靠。",
	"Certain spells allow casters to perceive or manipulate the effects of the Weave in particular ways. The Weave itself also has irregularities that affect spells.": "某些法术允许施法者以特定的方式感知或操纵织网的效果。织网本身也有影响法术的不规则性。",
	"Detect magic reveals threads of the Weave woven together through spellcasting, or the \"knots\" of the Weave in a magic item. A magic item appears enmeshed in the silvery-blue threads of the Weave, and the way the threads are arranged reveals what type of magic is used (necromancy, abjuration, and so on). Similarly, active spells and areas imbued with magic are limned in a silvery network of threads, which might twist and reknit themselves depending on the magic involved.": "侦测魔法会显示出通过施法编织起来的编织线，或者魔法物品中的编织 \"结\"。一个魔法物品出现在银蓝色的编织线中，编织线的排列方式揭示了使用的是什么类型的魔法（死灵法术、咒语等等）。同样地，活跃的法术和被施以魔法的区域也被限定在银色的线网中，这些线可能会根据所涉及的魔法而扭曲和重新编织起来。",
	"Dispel magic unwinds and prematurely ends magic, unraveling whatever construct of the Weave was put in place.": "驱散魔法会解开并过早地结束魔法，解开编织的任何结构。",
	"Antimagic effects can dispel existing spells and unravel any magic woven from the Weave. Permanent effects, such as those from magic items, are usually suppressed by antimagic: while the effect is within an area of antimagic, the construct of the Weave unravels, but the threads snap back into place once the magic is outside the area.": "反魔法效果可以驱散现有的法术，并解开任何从织网中编织出来的魔法。永久性的效果，例如来自魔法物品的效果，通常会被反魔法抑制：当效果在反魔法的区域内时，编织的结构会解开，但一旦魔法在该区域外，线就会重新回到原位。",
	"In rare areas of dead magic, the Weave is absent. Not only do spells and magic items cease to function, but even the supernatural abilities of creatures that are innately tied to the Weave might fail as the knot of the Weave they carry with them unravels.": "在罕见的死亡魔法区，织网是不存在的。不仅法术和魔法物品会停止运作，甚至那些天生与 \"编织 \"相连的生物的超自然能力也会因为他们携带的 \"编织 \"结的解开而失效。",
	"In an area of wild magic, the Weave becomes \"tangled,\" spontaneously forming its own constructs and resulting magic. It also tends to twist the constructs of the Weave created by spellcasting, causing unexpected results.": "在野生魔法区域，\"编织 \"变得 \"纠结\"，自发地形成自己的构造和产生的魔法。它还倾向于扭曲由咒语创造的编织体的构造，造成意外的结果。",
	"The inborn magical abilities of certain creatures, the acquired supernatural powers of people such as monks, and psionic abilities are similar in that their users don't manipulate the Weave in the customary way that spellcasters do. The mental state of the user is vitally important: monks and some psionics-users train long and hard to attain the right frame of mind, while creatures with supernatural powers have that mind-set in their nature. How these abilities are related to the Weave remains a matter of debate; many students of the arcane believe that the use of the so-called Unseen Art is an aspect of magical talent that can't be directly studied or taught.": "某些生物与生俱来的魔法能力、僧侣等人获得的超自然力量，以及幻术能力都是类似的，因为它们的使用者并不像施法者那样以习惯的方式来操纵编织物。使用者的精神状态是至关重要的：僧侣和一些幻术师为了达到正确的心态而进行了长期而艰苦的训练，而具有超自然力量的生物在本质上就具有这种心态。这些能力与 \"编织 \"的关系如何，仍然是一个争论不休的问题；许多研究奥术的学生认为，使用所谓的 \"看不见的艺术 \"是魔法天赋的一个方面，不能直接研究或教授。",
	"Where a spell effect is brought to life by manipulating the threads of the Weave, the creation of a magic item ties some of those threads together in a specific way, to produce the desired effect for as long as the item lasts. The Weave provides immediately available energy for spells and also enables those who know the craft to harness that energy inside an object until it is called forth by its user (who, of course, need not be a spellcaster).": "咒语效果是通过操纵 \"编织 \"的线来实现的，而魔法物品的创造则是将其中一些线以特定的方式绑在一起，在物品持续的时间内产生所需的效果。编织物为法术提供了立即可用的能量，同时也使那些懂得这门手艺的人能够在物品中利用这些能量，直到使用者（当然，使用者不一定是施法者）召唤它。",
	"In some cases, the magic of an item must be tied to its wielder, representing an entwining of the threads of the Weave between wielder and object known as attunement. As with all matters related to magic, the number of items to which a single being can be attuned is limited, but the benefits of such a relationship can be considerable.": "在某些情况下，一件物品的魔力必须与它的持有者联系在一起，这代表着持有者和物品之间的编织线的缠绕，被称为调和。与所有与魔法有关的事项一样，一个人可以与之调和的物品数量是有限的，但这种关系的好处是巨大的。",
	"mythals are some of the most powerful magic in the world of Toril, constructs that bind and shape the Weave  in a particular location, sometimes so powerfully that the rules of magic or even reality can be bent or rewritten.": "神话是托里尔世界中最强大的魔法，是在特定地点束缚和塑造编织的构造物，有时强大到魔法甚至现实的规则都可以被弯曲或改写。",
	"A mythal is a permanent field of overlapping magical wards and effects tied to a specific location. In its original usage, this term applied to the works of High Magic that protected ancient elven cities. It has since been expanded to cover all manner of similar protections, from the immense floating cities of fallen Netheril to the wards of Silverymoon to the smaller—but no less effective—workings of magic that keep safe important locations like Candlekeep. Even the many-layered wards and effects of Undermountain, beneath Waterdeep, are considered a mythal by some.": "魔法阵是一个由重叠的魔法阵和效果组成的永久性领域，与一个特定的地点相联系。在其最初的用法中，这个术语适用于保护古代精灵城市的高级魔法工程。此后，它被扩展到涵盖所有类似的保护方式，从堕落的尼瑟尔的巨大浮动城市到银月城的防护装置，再到较小但同样有效的魔法工作，以保护像烛台这样的重要地点的安全。即使是水底世界下面的地下山的多层防护和效果，也被一些人认为是一种神话。",
	"Most mythals are defensive in nature, designed to restrict the kinds of magic that can be employed in the area they govern, and the most common restrictions are concerned with teleportation and conjuration magic. Evereska's mythal influences the weather of the area and wards its inhabitants against disease, while the mythal of undersea Myth Nantar makes its waters breathable and more comfortable for creatures not suited to underwater life.": "大多数神话的性质是防御性的，旨在限制在其管辖区域内可以使用的各种魔法，最常见的限制涉及到传送和施法魔法。埃弗里斯卡的神话影响着该地区的天气，并为其居民抵御疾病，而海底神话南塔的神话则使其水域可以呼吸，让不适合水下生活的生物更加舒适。",
	"In many ways, a mythal is less like a spell or a magic item than a living creation of magic, capable of growing stronger or weaker, absorbing damage, or dying. mythals can also sometimes heal themselves, as did the mythal of Silverymoon, blossoming out of the Moonbridge following Mystra's most recent return. Each active mythal has one or more beings attuned to its effects, who can ignore any restrictions on spellcasting, can direct targetable effects of the mythal, and can teach others of appropriate skill how to access its secrets.": "在许多方面，神话并不像一个咒语或魔法物品，而是一个活生生的魔法创造物，能够变强或变弱，吸收伤害或死亡。神话有时也能自愈，就像银月的神话一样，在Mystra最近的回归之后，从月桥上绽放出来。每个活跃的神话都有一个或多个与之相适应的生命，他们可以无视对施法的任何限制，可以引导神话的目标效果，并可以教导具有适当技能的其他人如何获取其秘密。",
	"Except in cities such as Silverymoon and Evereska, adventurers are most likely to encounter damaged or failing mythals in ruined locations where magic once had great influence. Although an identify spell might reveal some of the simplest effects of a mythal, active restrictions on spellcasting can be discovered only by trying (and failing) to cast a prohibited spell. A powerful spellcaster might learn how to access or repair a mythal without assistance, but such feats are legendary, and rarely attempted by even the most renowned of mages. Any elven city with Myth in its title (Myth Drannor, Myth Glaurach, Myth Nantar, and others) has, or had, a mythal protecting it. The ruins of such places are certain to have unpredictable effects related to their damaged or destroyed mythals .": "除了在银月城和埃弗里斯卡这样的城市，冒险者们最有可能在魔法曾经具有巨大影响力的废墟中遇到受损或失效的神话。虽然识别法术可能会揭示神话的一些最简单的效果，但只有通过尝试（和失败）施放禁止的法术，才能发现对施法的主动限制。一个强大的施法者可能会学会如何在没有帮助的情况下进入或修复一个神话，但这种壮举是传奇性的，即使是最著名的法师也很少尝试。任何标题中带有神话的精灵城市（神话德兰诺、神话格劳拉赫、神话南塔等）都有或曾经有一个神话保护着它。这些地方的废墟肯定会有与它们受损或被毁的神话有关的不可预测的影响。",
	"Though wizards work wonders with their Art, and adventurers take their fates into their own hands, it is on the gods that most folk in the Forgotten Realms depend when they have need. The gods play a role in the lives of nearly everyone, from the mightiest lord to the meanest urchin.": "尽管巫师们用他们的艺术创造奇迹，冒险家们将他们的命运掌握在自己手中，但在被遗忘的王国里，大多数人在有需要时都会依赖神灵。诸神几乎在每个人的生活中都发挥着作用，从最强大的领主到最卑微的顽童。",
	"The various races of Toril worship their pantheons, which remain largely the same from region to region, with different cultures and societies emphasizing some deities over others. Although exceptions exist—the gods of Mulhorand, for example—all the gods are revered across all of Faerûn.": "托里尔的各个种族都崇拜他们的万神殿，这些万神殿在各个地区基本保持一致，不同的文化和社会强调一些神灵而不是其他。尽管存在例外--例如穆尔霍兰的神灵--但所有的神灵在整个法鲁恩都受到敬仰。",
	"The average person worships different gods in different contexts. Most vocations have a patron deity: farmers make offerings to Chauntea for the prosperity of their crops, clerks sharpen their quills with a prayer to Deneir, while pious merchants remember to set coins aside for Waukeen at the end of the day. Most people worship a deity associated with their livelihood, family, or home, while others feel called to a particular god for a variety of reasons. Individuals often carry or wear a small token of their favored deity: a pendant or a pin in the image of the god's holy symbol, or some other personal keepsake.": "普通人在不同的环境下崇拜不同的神。大多数职业都有一个守护神：农民为庄稼的繁荣向Chauntea供奉，文员在磨笔时向Deneir祈祷，而虔诚的商人在一天结束时记得为Waukeen留出硬币。大多数人崇拜与他们的生计、家庭或住宅有关的神，而其他人则因各种原因而感到被召唤到某个特定的神。个人经常携带或佩戴他们所钟爱的神灵的小信物：一个吊坠或神灵的神圣标志的徽章，或其他一些个人纪念品。",
	"In addition, people regularly venerate gods based on their needs and circumstances: a farmer whose favored deity is Chauntea would pray to Amaunator for a few clear, sunny days, and a Waterdhavian noble who habitually worships Denier would give thanks to Sune after a successful coming-out party for her son. Even priests of particular gods acknowledge the roles that other deities play in the world and in their lives.": "此外，人们经常根据自己的需要和情况来祭祀神灵：一个以Chauntea为最爱的神灵的农民会向Amaunator祈祷几个晴朗的日子，而一个习惯于崇拜Denier的Waterdhavian贵族会在她儿子的成功出柜派对后向Sune表示感谢。即使是特定神灵的祭司也承认其他神灵在世界和他们的生活中扮演的角色。",
	"In general, worshipers view their relationships with the gods as practical and reciprocal: they pray and make offerings because that is how one invites the blessings of the gods and turns away their wrath. These prayers and other acts of devotion are generally performed quietly at the shrine in one's household or community, or occasionally in a temple dedicated to one's deity, when a worshiper feels the need to \"come knocking upon a god's door\" to ask for attention.": "一般来说，崇拜者认为他们与神灵的关系是实际的和互惠的：他们祈祷和供奉，因为这就是一个人邀请神灵保佑和消除他们愤怒的方式。这些祈祷和其他奉献行为通常是在一个人的家庭或社区的神龛上悄悄进行的，或者偶尔在一个专门为自己的神灵服务的寺庙里进行，当一个崇拜者觉得有必要 \"来敲一个神的门 \"以寻求关注时。",
	"Forms of worship are often acts of veneration: giving thanks for favor shown, making requests for future blessings, and offering praise for the deity's intercessions, large and small. Because most folk in Faerûn don't want to attract the ire of the cruel or savage gods, beseeching them to keep the peace is also an act of worship. A hunter or a farmer might make offerings to Malar in hopes of keeping predators at bay, and a sailor might pray to Umberlee that she withhold her wrath for the duration of a voyage.": "崇拜的形式通常是崇敬的行为：对所表现出的恩惠表示感谢，对未来的祝福提出请求，并对神灵的大大小小的代祷表示赞美。因为法鲁恩的大多数人都不想引起残忍或野蛮的神灵的愤怒，恳求他们保持和平也是一种崇拜行为。猎人或农民可能会向马拉尔献上祭品，希望能阻止捕食者，而水手可能会向翁贝里祈祷，希望她在航行期间不要发怒。",
	"The Faerûnian pantheon isn't the only one known on Toril. Nonhuman races honor their own gods, for example, and people in faraway lands are known to worship altogether different gods. Occasionally, foreigners bring the worship of these gods to Faerûn. In addition, on rare occasions a new god comes into being, perhaps a mortal elevated to godhood or a deity whose arrival was foretold by prophets and leaders of new religions. In cosmopolitan places such as Waterdeep and Calimshan, small shrines and temples to strange gods spring up from time to time.": "法鲁尼神殿并不是托里尔岛上唯一的神殿。例如，非人类种族尊敬他们自己的神，而远方的人们则崇拜完全不同的神。偶尔，外国人会把这些神的崇拜带到法鲁恩。此外，在罕见的情况下，一个新的神灵出现了，也许是一个被提升为神的凡人，或者是一个由先知和新宗教领袖预言的神灵的到来。在沃特迪普和卡林山这样的国际大都市，时常会出现一些小型的神龛和庙宇来供奉奇怪的神灵。",
	"The burgeoning worship of a new deity is rarely a concern to the other gods of the Faerûnian pantheon, and the people who revere those deities, except when the newcomer's area of concern directly competes with that of an established deity. The methods of resolving such conflicts range from friendly dueling festivals or rites meant to emphasize the glory of one god over another, to campaigns of outright religious bloodshed.": "对一个新神的蓬勃崇拜很少会引起法尔尼安神殿中其他神灵的关注，以及对这些神灵的崇敬，除非新加入的神灵的关注领域直接与一个既定神灵的关注领域竞争。解决这种冲突的方法包括友好的决斗节或仪式，旨在强调一个神对另一个神的荣耀，以及彻底的宗教流血运动。",
	"Over generations, a new god might become a settled-in member of the pantheon. Indeed, some scholars posit that Faerûn has many \"immigrant\" gods, who joined the pantheon's ranks so long ago that their foreign origins are lost in antiquity.": "经过几代人的努力，一个新的神可能成为万神殿的固定成员。事实上，一些学者认为法鲁恩有许多 \"移民 \"神，他们很早就加入了万神殿的行列，以至于他们的外国渊源在古代就已经消失了。",
	"Over and over, mourning bells have tolled for some of the deities of the Realms. Gods were struck down during the Time of Troubles, when the Spellplague wrought its destruction, and most recently when Netheril fell. Some deities have even been slain by mortals wielding impossibly powerful magic.": "一次又一次，哀悼的钟声为王国的一些神灵敲响。在动乱时期，当咒语瘟疫造成破坏时，以及最近尼瑟尔陷落时，诸神被击倒。有些神灵甚至被挥舞着强大魔法的凡人所杀。",
	"When a god withdraws from a pantheon, divine magic stops flowing to the faithful, and miracles and omens associated with that god cease, that deity's priesthood loses faith, and holy sites are abandoned or taken over by other faiths. To the deity's worshipers in the world, it is immaterial whether the god is truly dead or merely dormant—the consequences for them are the same either way. Yet, as recent events have borne out, a god who is gone might not remain absent forever. More than a few supposedly dead gods have returned and amassed a new body of worshipers. Indeed, the legends of some gods speak of a cycle of death and resurrection.": "当一个神从万神殿中退出时，神圣的魔法不再流向信徒，与该神有关的奇迹和预兆也停止了，该神的祭司们失去了信仰，圣地被放弃或被其他信仰接管。对于世界上的神灵崇拜者来说，神灵是真的死了还是只是休眠了并不重要--对他们来说，两种情况的后果都是一样的。然而，正如最近的事件所证明的那样，一个已经消失的神可能不会永远不存在。不止几个被认为已经死亡的神灵回来了，并聚集了一批新的崇拜者。事实上，一些神的传说中提到了死亡和复活的循环。",
	"As the Sage of Shadowdale once noted, \"If the gods can grant the power to raise mortals from death, why do ye assume they should be laid low by it forever?\"": "正如影子谷的圣人曾经指出的，\"如果诸神能赋予凡人从死亡中复活的力量，为什么你们认为他们应该永远被死亡所压制？\"",
	"Most humans believe the souls of the recently deceased are spirited away to the Fugue Plane, where they wander the great City of Judgment, often unaware they are dead. The servants of the gods come to collect such souls and, if they are worthy, they are taken to their awaited afterlife in the deity's domain. Occasionally, the faithful are sent back to be reborn into the world to finish work that was left undone.": "大多数人类相信，刚刚去世的人的灵魂会被带到赋格界，在那里他们在伟大的审判之城徘徊，往往不知道自己已经死亡。神的仆人会来收集这些灵魂，如果他们有价值，他们会被带到神的领域中等待来世。偶尔，忠诚的人也会被送回，重生到这个世界，完成未完成的工作。",
	"Souls that are unclaimed by the servants of the gods are judged by Kelemvor, who decides the fate of each one. Some are charged with serving as guides for other lost souls, while others are transformed into squirming larvae and cast into the dust.": "没有被神的仆人认领的灵魂由凯雷莫尔判断，他决定每个人的命运。有些人负责为其他迷失的灵魂提供指导，而其他人则被转化为蠕动的幼虫并被抛入尘土。",
	"Those who serve as priests of a god aren't necessarily clerics. Indeed, the power invested in clerics and other divine spellcasters by the gods is given out only rarely (see \"Divine Magic\" below). The work of a priest is to serve one's deity and that deity's faithful, a task that doesn't necessarily require the use of magic.": "担任某神的祭司的人不一定是神职人员。事实上，诸神赋予牧师和其他神术师的权力只在极少数情况下才会发放（见下文 \"神术\"）。牧师的工作是为自己的神灵和该神灵的信徒服务，这项任务不一定需要使用魔法。",
	"The kind of person attracted to a deity's priesthood depends on the tenets of that god: the cunning rogues who venerate Mask have little in common with the upright law-keepers of Tyr, and the delightful revelers who revere Lliira are different from both.": "一个神的神职吸引什么样的人取决于该神的信条：崇尚马斯克的狡猾流氓与泰尔的正直守法者没有什么共同之处，而崇尚莉莉拉的愉快狂欢者则与两者都不同。",
	"The core religious institutions of Faerûn are temples and shrines. Whether a small, out-of-the-way building, or a complex made up of multiple structures and tracts of land, each temple operates according to the traditions of its faith, although powerful or charismatic figures who rise to prominence within the temple hierarchy might motivate or inspire changes to those traditions.": "法鲁恩的核心宗教机构是寺庙和神殿。无论是偏僻的小建筑，还是由多个建筑和大片土地组成的综合体，每个寺庙都按照其信仰的传统运作，尽管在寺庙等级制度中崛起的强大或有魅力的人物可能会促使或激发对这些传统的改变。",
	"Temples in Faerûn don't have regular services as such. Group observances in a temple occur only at specific festival times, and priests also go out into the community to perform rites such as marriages and funerals. Temples are places where worshipers go either to spend personal or family time in a space consecrated to a deity or to seek the aid of the priests for some reason.": "法鲁恩的寺庙没有定期的服务。寺庙里的集体仪式只在特定的节日里举行，祭司们也会到社区里去举行婚礼和葬礼等仪式。寺庙是崇拜者去的地方，他们或者在一个被献给神灵的空间里度过个人或家庭时光，或者因某种原因寻求祭司的帮助。",
	"Small shrines and private chapels, as distinct from full-fledged temples, are common throughout Faerûn, particularly in areas where a temple doesn't exist. Shrines tend to be unstaffed, kept up by the locals and visitors who use the place for prayer. A shrine might be as modest as a roadside well, where traveling merchants can drop a coin to request good fortune from Waukeen, or as grand as a statue of Amaunator surrounded by braziers in a pavilion in the middle of a village.": "与成熟的寺庙不同，小型神社和私人小教堂在整个法鲁恩很常见，尤其是在没有寺庙的地区。祠堂往往没有工作人员，由当地人和使用该地进行祈祷的游客来维护。神殿可能像路边的水井一样简陋，旅行的商人可以在那里投下一枚硬币向沃肯祈求好运，也可能像村庄中央的亭子里被火炉包围的阿玛努纳特雕像一样宏伟。",
	"Traveling priests often seek out and visit these sites, and they act as meeting places for the faithful. When word gets around that a traveling priest of Eldath has come into town, the faithful seek her out at the holy spring dedicated to the goddess at the edge of town.": "旅行的祭司们经常寻找并访问这些地方，它们是信徒们的聚会场所。当消息传来，一位艾尔达斯的旅行祭司来到了镇上，信徒们就会在镇边献给女神的圣泉中寻找她。",
	"A family or business might maintain a shrine or a chapel to its favored deity, perhaps a set of wind chimes consecrated to Akadi hung from the high branches of a tree in the garden, or a wooden symbol shaped like the hand of Azuth in miniature displayed on a prominent wall with a space nearby to burn a candle or some incense.": "一个家庭或企业可能会给自己喜欢的神灵保留一个神龛或小教堂，也许是在花园里的一棵树的高枝上挂上一套献给阿卡迪的风铃，或者在显眼的墙上挂上一个形似阿苏特之手的微型木制符号，并在附近留出空间烧上蜡烛或一些香火。",
	"Though many tales are told of times past when the gods appeared in physical form and walked the land, occasions of that sort are few and far between. For the most part, the gods communicate with their faithful through signs and omens, appreciated by those able to interpret them. Of course, some signs are more subtle—and thus more open to interpretation—than others.": "虽然有许多关于过去神灵以肉身形式出现并在土地上行走的故事，但这种情况很少，也不多。在大多数情况下，诸神通过征兆和预兆与他们的信徒交流，那些能够解释这些征兆的人对此表示赞赏。当然，有些征兆更微妙，因此更容易被解释。",
	"The most common kind of communion that worshipers and priests find with their deities is in prayer, song, or meditation. Such experiences are intensely personal, and it is common wisdom to keep them that way. After all, \"advice\" from one's god that appears during morning prayer and gives one a good turn to the day is worthwhile only for oneself. Let each worshiper commune in their own way, as the saying goes.": "崇拜者和牧师与他们的神灵最常见的交流是在祈祷、唱歌或冥想中。这种体验是非常个人化的，保持这种体验是一种普遍的智慧。毕竟，在晨祷时出现的来自神的 \"建议\"，给人带来一天的好运气，只对自己有价值。俗话说，让每个崇拜者以他们自己的方式进行交流。",
	"Divine magic also provides a means of communing with the gods and can be used to call upon their guidance. Divine pronouncements of this sort are often personal in scope and brief, and those edicts that concern broader matters tend to be open to interpretation or debate.": "神圣的魔法也提供了一种与众神交流的手段，可以用来召唤他们的指导。这类神谕往往是个人范围的，而且很简短，而那些涉及更广泛事项的法令往往是可以解释或辩论的。",
	"Priesthood is a vocation like any other, with those who undertake it often honing their abilities through a system of apprenticeship. At a small temple, a novice or an acolyte might study under the only priest available. Larger temples can accommodate groups of acolytes, each learning under the direction of one or more mentors responsible for training them in the duties and skills of the priesthood.": "牧师是一种与其他职业一样的天职，从事这一职业的人往往通过学徒制度来磨练自己的能力。在一个小庙里，新手或圣徒可能在唯一的牧师手下学习。较大的寺庙可以容纳成群的圣徒，每个人都在一位或多位导师的指导下学习，负责训练他们的神职职责和技能。",
	"Once acolytes complete their education, they are often ordained in a ritual in which a successful candidate is invested with the responsibilities of the priesthood.": "一旦圣徒完成了他们的教育，他们通常会在一个仪式中被授予圣职，在这个仪式中，成功的候选人被赋予了圣职的责任。",
	"The moral and ethical values of the deities in Faerûn run the gamut, representing all the outlooks that their mortal followers demonstrate, from the principled agents of good to the vicious proponents of evil. Most cultures and societies aren't nearly as cosmopolitan as the population of Faerûn taken as a whole; as a result, religious persecution (from the viewpoint of those who garner the attention) is practiced in places where worship of certain deities is frowned on.": "Faerûn的神灵的道德和伦理价值是不一样的，代表了他们的凡人追随者的所有观点，从有原则的善的代理人到邪恶的支持者。大多数文化和社会并不像法鲁恩的人口那样具有世界性；因此，宗教迫害（从那些获得关注的人的角度来看）是在那些对某些神灵的崇拜不受欢迎的地方实行的。",
	"Most governments that engage in persecution limit such restrictions to the establishment of formal temples, priesthoods, and organized festivals. (On a practical level, it's impossible to prevent individuals from innocuously or secretly worshiping whichever deities they choose.) For instance, although worship of Talona—like that of many evil gods—is forbidden in Waterdeep, this prohibition extends only to the creation of a temple and the presence of her priesthood within the city. Individual citizens or families who revere Talona might be viewed as misguided, but they aren't taken into custody or punished as long as they obey the laws of the city.": "大多数从事迫害的政府将这种限制限制在建立正式的寺庙、祭司职位和有组织的节日上。(在实际层面上，不可能阻止个人无害地或秘密地崇拜他们选择的任何神灵）。例如，尽管在沃特迪普禁止对塔罗娜的崇拜，就像禁止对许多邪神的崇拜一样，但这一禁令只适用于在城市中建立神庙和她的神职人员。崇拜塔罗娜的个别市民或家庭可能会被视为误导，但只要他们遵守城市的法律，就不会被拘留或惩罚。",
	"Some places take this form of persecution a step further, for a variety of reasons. A tyrant might outlaw worship of Torm, lest it inspire rebellion, and an otherwise fair-minded mayor of a river-mill community might demand that worshipers of Silvanus find elsewhere to live because of recent problems the timber-cutters have had with local druids.": "有些地方出于各种原因，将这种迫害的形式更进一步。一个暴君可能会宣布对托尔姆的崇拜为非法，以免引起叛乱，而一个河边磨坊社区的市长可能会要求希尔瓦娜斯的崇拜者到其他地方居住，因为最近伐木工人与当地德鲁伊发生了矛盾。",
	"The gods show their favor toward mortals in myriad ways. A chosen few have their minds and souls opened to the power of magic. There is no formula for who does and doesn't receive this divine insight, as the gods keep their own counsel concerning their selections. Some who are favored seek to ignore or deny their gift, while others embrace it wholeheartedly.": "诸神以无数种方式向凡人示好。被选中的少数人的思想和灵魂被打开，接受魔法的力量。对于谁能得到或不能得到这种神圣的洞察力，没有任何公式，因为众神对他们的选择有自己的看法。一些被选中的人试图忽视或否认他们的天赋，而其他人则全心全意地拥抱它。",
	"Some who display the potential for divine magic develop and practice their abilities in a temple, a sacred grove, or some other spiritual place, perhaps in the company of other students. Other practitioners of divine magic discover and nurture their gods-given power entirely on their own.": "一些显示出神圣魔法潜力的人在寺庙、神圣的小树林或其他灵性场所发展和练习他们的能力，也许还有其他学生陪伴。其他神术修行者则完全靠自己的力量发现和培养神赐的力量。",
	"The gods that make up the pantheon of Faerûn are much like the population of some of the Realms' greatest cities: an eclectic blend of individuals from a variety of sources. The makeup of the pantheon has shifted over the ages, as a result of changes in the Realms and its people (or vice versa, depending on which scholars you believe). The following pages describe the most prominent members of the pantheon.": "构成法鲁恩万神殿的诸神就像一些王国最伟大的城市的人口一样：由来自不同来源的个人组成，不拘一格。万神殿的构成随着时间的推移而变化，这是王国和人民变化的结果（或者相反，取决于你相信哪位学者）。以下几页描述了万神殿中最杰出的成员。",
	"The deities of the Faerûnian pantheon are by no means the only powers worshiped in the Realms. The nonhuman races have pantheons of their own (described in chapter 3), and scattered other cults and local divinities can be found across Faerûn.": "法鲁尼亚万神殿的神灵绝非是王国中唯一被崇拜的力量。非人类种族也有自己的万神殿（见第三章），在法鲁恩各地还可以找到零散的其他宗教和地方神灵。",

	"People of Faerûn refer to Mulhorand as one of the Old Empires, but most don't know that Mulhorand is in fact the oldest human empire still in existence on the continent. Mulhorand's pantheon of deities, sometimes called god-kings or pharaohs, can trace their lineage even farther back.": "法鲁恩的人们把穆尔霍兰德称为古老的帝国之一，但大多数人不知道穆尔霍兰德实际上是大陆上仍然存在的最古老的人类帝国。Mulhorand的万神殿，有时被称为神王或法老，他们的血统甚至可以追溯到更远。",
	"According to the demigods enthroned in Mulhorand, the ancestors of the Mulhorandi people were brought from another world and enslaved by the Imaskari in an ancient empire deep in what is now Raurin, the Dust Desert. When the gods of those ancestors heard the pleas of their distant faithful, they set out in a great celestial ark guided by the entity known as Ptah. Upon arriving in the world, two of the deities, Re and Enlil, set about empowering the slaves and fomenting rebellion.": "根据Mulhorand的半神们的说法，Mulhorandi人的祖先是从另一个世界带来的，并在一个古老的帝国中被Imaskari人奴役，该帝国位于现在的Raurin，即尘土沙漠深处。当那些祖先的神听到他们遥远的信徒的恳求时，他们在被称为普塔的实体的引导下乘坐一艘巨大的天体方舟出发了。到达这个世界后，其中两位神灵，Re和Enlil，开始赋予奴隶权力并煽动叛乱。",
	"The revolt succeeded, but Re and Enlil couldn't keep peace with one another. Each then founded a separate dynasty of divine mortals, Re in Mulhorand, and Enlil (father of Gilgeam) in Unther. Re and his related deities ruled Mulhorand through mortal incarnations for thousands of years.": "叛乱成功了，但Re和Enlil无法保持彼此的和平。于是，他们各自建立了一个独立的神性凡人王朝，Re在Mulhorand，而Enlil（Gilgeam的父亲）在Unther。Re和他的相关神灵通过凡人的化身统治了Mulhorand，长达数千年之久。",
	"Time took its toll, and the attention the deities of Mulhorand paid to their followers wavered and diminished. Each new incarnation of Isis, Osiris, and Thoth was a little more human and a little less divine. When the magically powerful Imaskari returned with a vengeance a little over a century ago, they stole the scepter of rulership from a grasp so weak it barely had any strength left.": "随着时间的推移，穆尔霍兰德的神灵们对他们的追随者的关注也在动摇和减弱。伊希斯、奥西里斯和托斯的每一个新化身都多了几分人性，少了几分神性。一个多世纪前，当魔法强大的伊马斯卡里人报复性地回来时，他们把统治权杖从一个软弱得几乎没有任何力量的手中偷走了。",
	"Although Mulhorand's conquerors outlawed slavery in the area they now called High Imaskar, the Mulhorandi people recognized the yoke they now bore. The Imaskari were the new coming of the slavemasters of old, as depicted in the carvings in the pharaohs' tombs. Many prayed that the vanished gods would return and once again free them from Imaskari rule, and during the Sundering, that is what happened. What were referred to as Chosen in other lands were recognized in Mulhorand as living gods, come to lead the Mulhorandi in an uprising.": "尽管穆尔霍兰的征服者在他们现在称为高伊马斯卡的地区取缔了奴隶制，但穆尔霍兰迪人认识到他们现在背负的枷锁。伊马斯卡利人是古老的奴隶主的新来者，正如法老墓穴中的雕刻所描绘的那样。许多人祈祷消失的神灵会回来，再次将他们从伊马斯卡利的统治中解放出来，而在分裂时期，这就是发生的事情。在其他地方被称为神选者的东西在穆尔霍兰被认为是活的神，来领导穆尔霍兰迪人的起义。",
	"Today Mulhorand is ruled by demigods that call themselves by such names as Re, Anhur, Horus, Isis, Nephthys, Set, and Thoth. They take different forms, some human and others tieflings or aasimar, but all speak and act like the gods of legend come to life, which they must be. This family of deities bears the scars of all the past loves, rivalries, and wars between them, but for now they have set their differences aside for the betterment of Mulhorand and its people, and the people of Mulhorand love them for it.": "今天，Mulhorand由半神统治，他们自称为Re、Anhur、Horus、Isis、Nephthys、Set和Thoth等名字。他们采取不同的形式，有些是人类，有些是盗贼或阿西玛人，但他们的言行举止都像传说中的神灵，他们一定是这样。这个神灵家族背负着过去所有的爱情、竞争和战争的伤痕，但现在他们为了穆尔霍兰德和它的人民更好地发展而把他们的分歧放在一边，穆尔霍兰德的人民也因此而爱他们。",
	"the keeper of the eternal sun, the light of law, the yellow god": "永恒的太阳的守护者，法律之光，黄色的上帝",
	"The rule of law and the glory of the sun are both in Amaunator's dominion. His priests help establish bureaucracies and lawful order in communities. They often witness contracts and signed agreements, stamping such documents with the sun-symbol of Amaunator to signify their validity.": "法治和太阳的光辉都在Amaunator的统治之下。他的祭司帮助建立官僚机构和社区的合法秩序。他们经常见证合同和签署的协议，在这些文件上盖上阿玛努纳特的太阳符号，以表示其有效性。",
	"His priests teach that Amaunator has died and been reborn time and again. Like the sun, he might pass into the realm of darkness, but inevitably his bright gaze will fall on the world once again. Amaunator is seen as a stern and unforgiving deity, not unlike Silvanus in comportment, but his concern isn't for the balance of life—he cares that things proceed according to the celestial order, that promises are kept, and that the rule of law persists.": "他的牧师们教导说，阿玛努纳特已经死了，并且一次又一次地重生了。就像太阳一样，他可能会进入黑暗的领域，但不可避免的是，他明亮的目光会再次落在这个世界上。阿玛努纳特被看作是一个严厉而无情的神，在行为举止上与希尔瓦努斯并无二致，但他关心的不是生命的平衡--他关心的是事情是否按照天体秩序进行，承诺是否兑现，以及法治是否持续。",
	"Farmers and travelers beseech him when they pray for rain or sun, as do any others looking for a favorable change in the weather. But the most common form of propitiation to Amaunator is the practice of swearing oaths, signing contracts, and declaring laws under the light of the sun. So ingrained in the common perception is the connection between a solemn oath and the sun that those engaged in closing deals or issuing edicts often pause and wait for a passing cloud to clear the sun before completing the transaction or pronouncement.": "农民和旅行者在祈求雨水或太阳时都会向他祈求，就像任何其他寻求有利天气变化的人一样。但最常见的祭祀阿玛努特的形式是在太阳光下宣誓、签署合同和宣布法律的做法。庄严的誓言和太阳之间的联系在普通人的观念中是如此根深蒂固，以至于那些从事交易或发布法令的人经常暂停，等待过往的云彩将太阳照亮，然后完成交易或宣布。",
	"the lord of the ninth, the cloven, old hoof and horn": "九头鸟的主人，驽马的主人，古老的蹄子和角的主人",
	"Open worship of Asmodeus began roughly a century ago when small cults with charismatic leaders sprang up in the aftermath of the Spellplague. That catastrophe left many asking why the gods were angry or had abandoned them. To those questioners, the faithful of Asmodeus provided answers and a god who would forgive all their faults. Still, for the next few decades, the {@cult Cult of Asmodeus} struggled for acceptance.": "对阿斯莫德的公开崇拜大约始于一个世纪前，当时在法术瘟疫之后，有魅力的领导人的小邪教兴起。那场灾难让许多人问为什么神灵生气或抛弃了他们。对于这些提问者，阿斯莫德的信徒们提供了答案，以及一个会原谅他们所有错误的神。尽管如此，在接下来的几十年里，%0%的人仍在努力争取被接受。",
	"In the beliefs of the people of the North—which coincide with many tales told by dwarves, elves, and others—Asmodeus is Lord of the Ninth, the leader of all devils of the Nine Hells. People know devils to be iron-minded and silver-tongued purveyors of temptation, whose price for their boons can be as dear as one's soul. It's said that when a soul waits on the Fugue Plane for a deity to take it to its appropriate afterlife, devils approach the soul and offer it a chance at power and immortal pleasures. All a soul needs to do is take one step out of the dust and the milling crowd and put a foot on the first rung of the infernal ladder that represents the hierarchy of the Nine Hells.": "在北方人的信仰中--这与矮人、精灵和其他人讲述的许多故事相吻合--阿斯摩德是九世之主，是九层地狱所有魔鬼的领袖。人们知道魔鬼是铁石心肠和银牙利齿的诱惑传播者，他们的好处的价格可以和人的灵魂一样珍贵。据说，当一个灵魂在赋格平面上等待神灵把它带到适当的来世时，魔鬼就会接近这个灵魂，给它一个获得权力和不朽快乐的机会。灵魂所需要做的就是走出尘埃和熙熙攘攘的人群，踏上代表九层地狱等级制度的地狱阶梯的第一层。",
	"The faithful of Asmodeus acknowledge that devils offer their worshipers a path that's not for everyone—just as eternally basking in the light of Lathander or endlessly swinging a hammer in the mines of Moradin might not be for everyone. Those who serve Asmodeus in life hope to be summoned out of the moaning masses of the Fugue Plane after death. They yearn for the chance to master their own fates, with all of eternity to achieve their goals.": "阿斯莫德的信徒们承认，魔鬼为他们的崇拜者提供了一条道路，但这并不适合每一个人，就像永远沐浴在拉坦德的光芒下，或者在莫拉丁的矿场里无休止地挥舞锤子，可能并不适合每一个人。那些生前为阿斯莫德服务的人希望死后能被从赋格平面的呻吟人群中召唤出来。他们渴望有机会掌握自己的命运，用所有的永恒来实现他们的目标。",
	"To those not so dedicated, priests of Asmodeus offer the prospect of a reprieve in the afterlife. All souls wait on the Fugue Plane for a deity's pleasure, which determines where a soul will spend the rest of eternity. Those who lived their lives most in keeping with a deity's outlook are taken first. Others, who have transgressed in the eyes of their favored god or have not followed any particular ethos, might wait centuries before Kelemvor judges where they go. People who fear such a fate can pray to Asmodeus, his priests say, and in return a devil will grant a waiting soul some comfort.": "对于那些不那么虔诚的人，阿斯莫德的祭司们提供了在来世得到缓和的前景。所有的灵魂都在赋格平面上等待神灵的喜悦，这决定了一个灵魂将在哪里度过余下的永恒岁月。那些生活中最符合神灵观点的人首先被带走。其他人，如果在他们所喜爱的神的眼中犯了错，或者没有遵循任何特定的道德规范，可能会在凯勒莫尔判断他们的去向之前等待几个世纪。害怕这种命运的人可以向阿斯莫德（Asmodeus）祈祷，他的牧师说，作为回报，一个魔鬼会给等待的灵魂一些安慰。",
	"Today, shrines to Asmodeus are still rare and temples are almost unheard of, but many folk have adopted the habit of asking Asmodeus for reprieve from their sins. After transgressing against a god in some way, a person prays to Asmodeus for something to provide respite during the long wait. Asmodeus is known to grant people what they wish, and thus people pray for all the delights and distractions they desire most from life. Those who transgress in great ways often ask Asmodeus to hide their sins from the gods, and priests say that he will do so, but with a price after death.": "今天，阿斯莫德的神龛仍很罕见，寺庙也几乎闻所未闻，但许多人都养成了向阿斯莫德请求赦免罪过的习惯。在以某种方式触犯了某位神灵之后，人们会向阿斯莫德祈祷，希望在漫长的等待中得到喘息的机会。众所周知，阿斯莫德会满足人们的愿望，因此人们祈求他们在生活中最渴望的所有乐趣和分心。那些犯了大错的人经常要求阿斯莫德向诸神隐瞒他们的罪过，祭司们说他会这样做，但死后要付出代价。",
	"the frostmaiden, lady frostkiss, icedawn": "霜女, 霜吻女士, 冰晨",
	"Auril, the merciless goddess of cold and winter, is worshiped mostly in regions that are affected by deep winters. Folk propitiate Auril with offerings and prayers for mercy. Her priests warn others to prepare for winter, and to stock extra provisions in order to have some to spare as offerings to the goddess.": "寒冷和冬季的无情女神奥里尔（Auril），主要在受深冬影响的地区被崇拜。民间用祭品和祈祷来祈求奥里尔的怜悯。她的祭司们警告其他人要为冬天做好准备，并储存额外的食物，以便有一些剩余的食物作为对女神的供奉。",
	"Few favor Auril except for those who make their livelihood from winter or those who truly love the season. Her rare priests tend to be folk who would, but for their status, likely be outcasts from their communities. They practice celibacy and remain aloof from others when not serving in their official capacity.": "除了那些以冬季为生的人或真正热爱这个季节的人之外，很少有人喜欢Auril。她罕见的牧师往往是那些如果不是因为他们的身份，很可能会被社区抛弃的人。他们实行独身主义，在不以官方身份服务时，对其他人保持冷漠。",
	"Luskan has a temple dedicated to Auril, the whitespired Winter Palace. The structure is a roofless array of pillars and arches carved of white stone. The rituals of Auril's worship often seem cruel to outsiders. In Luskan, visitors gather at the temple to watch the frequent \"wet parades,\" a ritual in which supplicants don garments packed with ice. They then journey between six white pillars known as the Kisses of Auril, which are dispersed throughout the city. The worshipers move from pillar to pillar, chanting prayers to the goddess. Upon reaching a pillar, a supplicant must climb it and then \"kiss the lady,\" touching lips to a rusty iron plate at the top. In winter, these events resemble frantic footraces, with the added risk of frostbite and injuries caused by falling from the slippery pillars. The parade runners are cheered on by patrons who come out of nearby taverns to place bets on the stamina of the participants. Those who finish the race are thought to have helped make the winter easier, and they rarely have to pay for food or ale all winter long.": "卢斯坎有一座供奉奥里尔的神庙，即白描的冬宫。该结构是一个由白色石头雕刻的柱子和拱门组成的无屋顶阵列。在外人看来，奥里尔的崇拜仪式往往是残酷的。在卢斯坎，游客们聚集在寺庙，观看频繁的 \"湿身游行\"，在这种仪式中，祈求者穿上装满冰块的衣服。然后他们在被称为 \"奥里尔之吻 \"的六根白色柱子之间穿梭，这些柱子分散在整个城市。崇拜者从一个柱子到另一个柱子，向女神诵读祈祷文。到达一个柱子后，祈求者必须爬上柱子，然后 \"亲吻女士\"，将嘴唇接触到柱子顶端的一块生锈的铁板。在冬天，这些活动类似于疯狂的赛跑，同时还有冻伤和从湿滑的柱子上摔下来受伤的风险。游行者受到附近酒馆的顾客的欢呼，他们在参与者的耐力上下注。那些完成比赛的人被认为是帮助了这个冬天，他们在整个冬天很少需要支付食物或酒水。",
	"the high one, the lord of spellcraft, the first magister": "高高在上的法术之神，第一个魔法师",
	"Few pay homage to Azuth aside from wizards. For them, the High One is the ultimate embodiment of all that they hold dear.": "除了巫师之外，很少有人向阿苏特致敬。对他们来说，\"高人 \"是他们所珍视的一切的最终化身。",
	"Mystra serves as goddess of magic; Oghma is god of knowledge; and Deneir is god of writing and language. Azuth takes aspects of these general fields and applies them to the specific practices of wizards. For instance, while Mystra is the deity who represents the soul, art, and wonder of magic, Azuth is god of a wizard's long hours of study, exacting standards of movement and speech, and cramped, ink-stained fingers. Wizards invoke Azuth when they scribe scrolls, inscribe magic circles, attempt to memorize spells, and even when they cast spells. Often this acknowledgment comes in the form of silently forming Azuth's holy symbol, pointing the index finger of the left hand to the sky. For many wizards, the gesture is so commonplace in their lives that it becomes an unconscious habit.": "米斯特拉是魔法女神；奥格玛是知识之神；迪内尔是写作和语言之神。阿苏斯从这些一般领域中抽取一些方面，并将其应用于巫师的具体实践。例如，Mystra是代表魔法的灵魂、艺术和奇迹的神，而Azuth则是巫师长时间学习、严格的动作和语言标准以及抽筋、沾满墨水的手指的神。巫师们在书写卷轴、刻画魔法阵、尝试记忆法术，甚至在施展法术时都会召唤阿苏特。这种承认往往是以默默地形成阿祖思的神圣符号的形式出现，将左手的食指指向天空。对许多巫师来说，这个手势在他们的生活中是如此常见，以至于成为一种无意识的习惯。",
	"Temples dedicated to Azuth are scarce, and clerics of the deity are extremely rare. Even in magic-saturated Halruaa, only a handful of holy places are dedicated to Azuth. Sometimes a statue or a shrine dedicated to him stands in a corner of a temple to Mystra or another deity. More often, a wizard has a personal shrine at home. Azuth is represented at such sites as a hooded and bearded figure with left hand held high, finger pointed up. Sometimes he is represented by merely the hand. In either case, the finger often serves as a candleholder or as the point of origin for a light spell.": "献给阿苏特的寺庙很少，神职人员也极为罕见。即使在魔法盛行的哈尔鲁阿，也只有少数几个圣地供奉着阿苏特。有时，在供奉Mystra或其他神灵的寺庙的一个角落里，会有一个供奉他的雕像或神龛。更常见的是，巫师在家里有一个个人神龛。在这些地方，阿苏斯被表现为一个戴着头巾、留着胡子的形象，左手高举，手指向上。有时他只用手来代表。在这两种情况下，手指经常作为烛台或作为光明咒语的起源点。",
	"the black hand, the lord of darkness": "黑手，黑暗的主宰者",
	"Bane has a simple ethos: the strong have not just the right but the duty to rule over the weak. A tyrant who is able to seize power must do so, for not only does the tyrant benefit, but so do those under the tyrant's rule. When a ruler succumbs to decadence, corruption, or decrepitude, a stronger and more suitable ruler will rise.": "班恩有一个简单的道德观：强者不仅有权利而且有义务统治弱者。能够夺取权力的暴君必须这样做，因为不仅暴君受益，在暴君统治下的人也会受益。当一个统治者屈服于颓废、腐败或堕落时，一个更强大、更合适的统治者将崛起。",
	"Bane is vilified in many legends. Throughout history, those who favor him have committed dark deeds in his name, but most people don't worship Bane out of malice. Bane represents ambition and control, and those who have the former but lack the latter pray to him to give them strength. It is said that Bane favors those who exhibit drive and courage, and that he aids those who seek to become conquerors, carving kingdoms from the wilderness, and bringing order to the lawless.": "班恩在许多传说中都被诋毁。纵观历史，那些偏爱他的人以他的名义做出了黑暗的行为，但大多数人并不是出于恶意而崇拜贝恩。班恩代表着野心和控制，那些拥有前者但缺乏后者的人向他祈祷，希望他能给他们力量。据说贝恩偏爱那些表现出魄力和勇气的人，他帮助那些寻求成为征服者的人，从荒野中雕刻出王国，并为无法无天的人带来秩序。",
	"At many times and in many places in Faerûn, the faithful of Bane have been seen as saviors for their efforts in slaughtering raiders, throwing down corrupt rulers, or saving armies on the brink of defeat. But in just as many other places, the worship of Bane has created or supported cruel dictatorships, aided mercantile monopolies, or brought about the practice of slavery where before it didn't exist.": "在Faerûn的许多时候和许多地方，Bane的信徒被视为救世主，因为他们努力屠杀突袭者，推翻腐败的统治者，或拯救濒临失败的军队。但在其他许多地方，对贝恩的崇拜也创造或支持了残酷的独裁统治，帮助了商业垄断，或在以前不存在的地方带来了奴隶制的做法。",
	"the maid of misfortune, lady doom, black bess": "不幸的女仆，厄运女士，黑贝斯",
	"Beshaba is the counterpoint to Tymora and is just as frequently acknowledged in daily life as is her more benevolent \"sister.\" She is seen as a cruel and capricious goddess who must be propitiated to avoid attracting her attention and interest in a negative way.": "贝沙巴是泰莫拉的对立面，在日常生活中与她更仁慈的 \"妹妹 \"一样经常被承认。她被看作是一个残酷而任性的女神，必须对她进行祭祀，以避免以消极的方式吸引她的注意和兴趣。",
	"Beshaba's name is invoked when someone is beset by bad luck—which could be as minor as stubbing a toe or breaking a wagon wheel, or as catastrophic as slipping and accidentally falling off a cliff. It is also invoked to ward off her attentions when someone is doing something in which good luck wouldn't play a part but bad luck might. For example, someone rolling dice would invoke Tymora because they want random chance to fall in their favor, but someone about to cross a rickety bridge would ask Beshaba to keep the bridge intact.": "Beshaba的名字在某人被厄运困扰时被引用--厄运可能是小事，如戳到脚趾或弄坏马车车轮，也可能是灾难性的，如滑倒并意外地掉下悬崖。当有人在做一些好运不会影响到他，但坏运气可能会影响到他的事情时，也会引用它来抵御她的注意。例如，有人在掷骰子时会召唤泰莫拉，因为他们希望随机的机会对他们有利，但有人要过一座摇摇欲坠的桥时会请求贝沙巴保持桥的完整。",
	"Folk make the symbol of Beshaba by folding in their thumbs and extending their fingers on one or both hands (mimicking the horns of her holy symbol) to ward off misfortune. The same gesture raised to the head signifies a salute; when pointed at someone, the \"horns\" indicate ill favor directed toward that individual.": "民间用大拇指折叠，伸出一只手或两只手的手指（模仿她的神圣标志的角）来做贝沙巴的象征，以抵御不幸。同样的手势举到头上表示敬礼；当指向某人时，\"角 \"表示对该人的不友好。",
	"Many druids worship Beshaba as one of the First Circle. They propitiate her with dances while wearing fire-blackened antlers dipped in blood. According to these druids, her holy symbol is the horns of a stag because when Beshaba was first worshiped, humans were simple hunter-gatherers and she was believed to bring misfortune to hunters, such as being gored by a stag.": "许多德鲁伊将贝沙巴作为第一圈的一员加以崇拜。他们戴着蘸了血的火黑鹿角，用舞蹈来祭祀她。根据这些德鲁伊的说法，她的神圣象征是雄鹿的角，因为在贝沙巴最初被崇拜时，人类是简单的狩猎采集者，她被认为会给猎人带来不幸，比如被雄鹿咬伤。",
	"Although most people tremble in fear at the prospect of Beshaba's attendance at any event (even in spirit), Beshaba is almost always invoked and welcomed formally in the opening speeches or ceremonies of formal functions such as marriages and coronations, contests of sport or martial prowess, and at the naming ceremonies of children. If she isn't invited to such an event, she might take offense and wreak misfortune on those involved.": "尽管大多数人对Beshaba出席任何活动（即使是精神上的）的前景感到恐惧，但Beshaba几乎总是在正式活动的开幕词或仪式上被援引并受到正式欢迎，如婚姻和加冕仪式、体育或武术比赛，以及儿童的命名仪式。如果她没有被邀请参加这样的活动，她可能会生气，并对有关人员造成不幸。",
	"Temples to Beshaba are virtually unknown. It's common, however, for rural folk to erect a post and mount antlers on it at the site of some roadside accident or murder. In cities, where antlers are hard to come by and murders and accidents more prevalent, the fashion is to draw the black antlers of Beshaba with charcoal on a nearby wall, leaving the symbol on display until weather scours it away. These \"shrines,\" in either form, serve as warnings to others about places of ill fortune.": "祭祀贝沙巴的庙宇几乎不存在。然而，农村人在路边发生事故或谋杀的地方竖起一根柱子，并在上面挂上鹿角，这很常见。在城市里，鹿角很难买到，谋杀和事故也更多，时尚的做法是在附近的墙上用木炭画出贝沙巴的黑色鹿角，让这个符号一直展示着，直到天气把它刮走。这些 \"神龛\"，无论是哪种形式，都是对他人的警告，提醒他们注意不吉利的地方。",
	"More formal shrines to Beshaba exist in places where folk frequently hope to ward off misfortune. These sites tend to be posts or stones painted red with blackened antlers attached to them, or a red, triangular wallmounted plaque with attached antlers. Both types have a stone or bronze bowl where coins can be tossed or burnt offerings made. The Red Wizards of Thay commonly erect such shrines outside their ritual chambers to guard against unfortunate mistakes.": "在民间经常希望抵御不幸的地方，有更正式的贝沙巴神龛。这些地方往往是涂成红色的柱子或石头，上面挂着发黑的鹿角，或者是一个红色的、挂在墙上的三角形牌子，上面挂着鹿角。这两种类型都有一个石碗或铜碗，可以投掷硬币或进行焚烧供奉。泰伊的红袍巫师们通常在他们的仪式室外竖起这样的神龛，以防止不幸的错误。",
	"Few dare to take Beshaba as a patron. The rare clerics of the Maid of Misfortune are those who have been deeply affected by great misfortunes and who seek to warn others of the essential unfairness of life—or to inflict that unfairness upon them.": "很少有人敢把贝沙巴作为赞助人。罕见的 \"不幸女仆 \"教士是那些深受巨大不幸影响的人，他们试图警告他人生活的本质不公平--或者将这种不公平施加于他们。",
	"the lord of murder": "谋杀案的主宰者",
	"The folk of Faerûn don't normally pray to or acknowledge Bhaal. He is seen as a deeply evil and destructive deity who hungers for death—meaning the death of any sentient beings through unlawful means.": "法鲁恩的居民通常不向巴尔祈祷或承认他。他被认为是一个极其邪恶和具有破坏性的神灵，他渴望死亡--指的是通过非法手段使任何有生命的人死亡。",
	"Some people pray to Bhaal when they want to commit murder. A person might have good reason to resort to murder, such as when one is unable to redress some injustice through lawful means. But it's far more common for prayers to Bhaal to be uttered by those who seek to kill someone out of jealousy, greed, or wrath. It's rare for anyone but assassins or compulsive killers to take Bhaal as a patron, and clerics who revere Bhaal often qualify on both counts.": "有些人在想杀人的时候会向Bhaal祈祷。一个人可能有充分的理由诉诸于谋杀，比如当一个人无法通过合法手段纠正某些不公正的行为时。但那些因嫉妒、贪婪或愤怒而想杀人的人对巴哈的祈祷则更为常见。除了刺客或强迫性杀手之外，很少有人会把巴哈勒当做守护神，而崇尚巴哈勒的神职人员往往在这两方面都符合条件。",
	"Murder cults of Bhaal have arisen in the past, each led by a charismatic, self-styled priest of Bhaal, but organized worship of the Lord of Murder is extremely uncommon. Temples and shrines are similarly rare. Those who erect a shrine to Bhaal usually do so to thank him for a successful murder. Such shrines typically feature a skull or a severed head surrounded by drops of blood (often both from the murdered victim).": "过去曾出现过对巴哈的谋杀崇拜，每个人都由一个有魅力的、自称是巴哈的牧师领导，但对谋杀之主的有组织的崇拜是极其不常见的。寺庙和神龛也同样罕见。那些为巴尔建立神龛的人通常是为了感谢他的成功谋杀。这类神龛通常以头骨或断头为特色，周围有血滴（通常都是被害人的血滴）。",
	"the great mother, the grain goddess": "伟大的母亲，粮食女神",
	"Chauntea is goddess of agriculture: sowing and reaping, seeding and harvest, breeding and butchery, shearing and weaving. In this aspect she is a rural deity rarely prayed to behind the walls of a city except by kitchen gardeners. But Chauntea is also the Great Mother, a goddess of crib, hearth, and home. And as such she is welcomed into all homes at mealtimes and at the birth of children, and folk give her thanks whenever they experience the pleasure of settling by a fire and feeling safe and loved.": "Chauntea是农业女神：播种和收割，播种和收获，繁殖和屠宰，剪羊毛和织布。在这方面，她是一位农村的神，除了厨房里的园丁，很少有人在城市的围墙后面向她祈祷。但Chauntea也是伟大的母亲，是摇篮、炉灶和家庭的女神。因此，她在吃饭时和孩子出生时被欢迎到所有的家庭，而且每当人们体验到在火堆旁定居并感到安全和被爱的乐趣时，就会向她表示感谢。",
	"Chauntea's faith is one of nurturing and growth. Agricultural aphorisms and farming parables dot her teachings. Growing and reaping, the eternal cycle, is a common theme in the faith. Destruction for its own sake, or leveling without rebuilding, is anathema to her.": "Chauntea的信仰是养育和成长。农业箴言和农耕寓言点缀着她的教义。成长和收获，永恒的循环，是信仰中的一个共同主题。为破坏而破坏，或只铲除而不重建，对她来说是一种诅咒。",
	"Temples of Chauntea maintain a great body of lore about farming and cultivation. Her priests work closely with communities in rural areas, and they are willing to roll up their sleeves and dig their hands into the dirt.": "Chauntea的寺庙保留了大量关于农耕和种植的传说。她的牧师与农村地区的社区密切合作，他们愿意卷起袖子，把手伸进土里。",
	"The druids of the Moonshae Isles worship the Earthmother, she who is the generative power of the land itself. To some mainlanders, the Earthmother is an aspect or manifestation of Chauntea, but to the Ffolk, she is simply the Earthmother, and always will be. The moonwells of the isles are her sacred sites and her windows onto the world. See \"Druids\" in chapter 4 for more information.": "月海群岛的德鲁伊们崇拜地母，她是土地本身的生成力量。对一些大陆人来说，地母是Chauntea的一个方面或表现，但对Ffolk来说，她只是地母，而且永远是。岛屿上的月井是她的圣地，是她通向世界的窗口。更多信息见第4章的 \"德鲁伊\"。",
	"the prince of lies, the dark sun": "谎言的王子，黑暗的太阳",
	"The worship of Cyric derives directly from the story of his ascension to godhood. Cyric was a mortal during the Time of Troubles and the key to how that chaotic period resolved, but he was also a selfish traitor and a murderer. When he became a god, Cyric continued to work various plots of deceit and murder—the most famous of which is that, according to legend, Cyric murdered Mystra and thus caused the Spellplague over a century ago.": "对居里的崇拜直接来源于他升天成神的故事。西里克是动乱时期的一个凡人，是那个混乱时期如何解决的关键，但他也是一个自私的叛徒和杀人犯。当他成为神后，赛里克继续实施各种欺骗和谋杀的阴谋--其中最著名的是，根据传说，赛里克在一个多世纪前谋杀了Mystra，从而引发了法术之灾。",
	"Those who don't worship Cyric see him as a god of madness, strife, and deceit, although his priests consider such claims to be heresy. Their Prince of Lies isn't a twisted madman, but a god of dark majesty who proves that, ultimately, all bonds between folk corrupt and wither away.": "那些不崇拜Cyric的人认为他是一个疯狂、争斗和欺骗的神，尽管他的牧师认为这种说法是异端。他们的谎言王子并不是一个扭曲的疯子，而是一个黑暗的威严之神，他证明了，最终，民间的所有纽带都会腐烂和凋零。",
	"Cyric's church works openly in Amn, where the citizens espouse the principles of ambition, self-reliance, and \"buyer beware.\" Those who take Cyric as their patron tend to be sadists, con artists, power-mad connivers, and worse. Other folk pray to Cyric when they want to do wrong but don't want others to find out about it.": "西里奇的教会在安恩公开运作，那里的公民崇尚野心、自力更生和 \"买家要小心 \"的原则。那些以赛里克为守护神的人往往是虐待狂、骗子、权力狂的骗子，甚至更糟。另一些人在想做坏事但又不想让别人发现时，会向西里克祈祷。",
	"\"The Dark Sun,\" originally one of Cyric's epithets, has become a metaphor for strife in the Realms. \"A Dark Sun has risen o'er this court\" might be spoken as a warning that intrigues and infighting have gotten out of hand in a noble household; and married couples know to seek advice from others if \"a Dark Sun shines through the window\" in their relationship.": "\"黑暗的太阳\"，最初是西里奇的外号之一，现在已经成为王国纷争的隐喻。\"黑暗的太阳在这个宫廷里升起 \"可能被说成是一个警告，即阴谋和内讧在一个贵族家庭中已经失控；已婚夫妇知道，如果在他们的关系中出现 \"黑暗的太阳照进了窗户\"，就要向别人寻求建议。",
	"the lord of all glyphs and images, the first scribe, the scribe of oghma": "所有字形和图像的主宰，第一个抄写员，Oghma的抄写员",
	"Deneir is the god of literature and literacy, the patron of the artist and the scribe. His is the power to accurately render and describe, to write and to read, and to pass on information. In legend, Deneir is often portrayed as being a scribe in service to Oghma, and he is sometimes thought of as Oghma's right hand.": "德尼尔是文学和识字之神，是艺术家和抄写员的守护者。他有能力准确地呈现和描述、书写和阅读，并传递信息。在传说中，Deneir经常被描绘成为Oghma服务的抄写员，他有时被认为是Oghma的右手。",
	"It's common practice for someone who writes a letter or records information to say a prayer to Deneir to avoid mistakes. Similarly, artists acknowledge Deneir before beginning and upon completing paintings, particularly illuminations on manuscripts, tapestries that relate stories, and any such attempt to use art to capture the truth.": "写信或记录信息的人通常会向Deneir祈祷以避免错误。同样，艺术家们在开始和完成绘画之前，特别是在手稿上的插图、与故事有关的挂毯以及任何此类试图用艺术来捕捉真相的作品时，都会向Deneir致意。",
	"Followers of Deneir believe that information not recorded and saved for later use is information lost. They consider literacy an important gift of the gods, one that should be spread and taught. His followers are scribes and scholars devoted, like their patron, to preserving written works, and also to experiencing them, for they say that Deneir himself is hidden within the lines, shapes, and passages of all written works. Priests of Deneir take an oath of charity as well, compelling them to accept the requests of others to write letters and transcribe information.": "德涅尔的追随者认为，没有记录和保存以供日后使用的信息就是丢失的信息。他们认为识字是诸神的重要礼物，应该被传播和传授。他的追随者是文士和学者，像他们的守护者一样，致力于保存书面作品，同时也致力于体验它们，因为他们说迪内尔本人隐藏在所有书面作品的线条、形状和段落中。Deneir的祭司们也会发下慈善的誓言，迫使他们接受他人的请求，写下信件和抄写信息。",
	"The god's followers tend to be individualists, united by their shared faith but not overly concerned with religious hierarchy and protocol. This behavior is supported by the fact that Deneir's blessings of divine magic are more often bestowed on those who lose themselves in written works than on those who fancy themselves part of any temple or religious order. Contemplation of the faith's most holy book, the Tome of Universal Harmony, is the most effective way to become deserving of Deneir's blessings.": "神的追随者往往是个人主义者，他们因共同的信仰而团结在一起，但对宗教等级和礼节并不过分关注。这种行为得到了以下事实的支持：德内尔的神圣魔法祝福更多的是赐予那些在文字作品中迷失自我的人，而不是那些自诩为任何神庙或宗教秩序的人。思考信仰中最神圣的书--《宇宙和谐之书》，是成为值得Deneir祝福的最有效方式。",
	"the quiet one, the guardian of groves, the mother of the waters": "宁静者，树林的守护者，水的母亲",
	"Eldath is the goddess of waterfalls, springs, pools, stillness, peace, and quiet glades. She is thought to be present at many such places, particularly those that serve as druid groves. Eldath is a goddess of comfort, healing, and calm. Her blessed waters heal the sick, cure madness, and comfort the dying.": "埃尔达斯是瀑布、泉水、水池、静止、和平和安静的小树林的女神。她被认为存在于许多这样的地方，特别是那些作为德鲁伊丛林的地方。埃尔达斯是一位舒适、治愈和平静的女神。她的祝福之水可以治愈病人，治愈疯狂，并安慰垂死的人。",
	"Most rural places have a pond or a glade that locals ascribe to Eldath. Tradition dictates that it be a place of quiet reflection where others are left to their thoughts. A body of water such as a pond or a spring typically serves as a repository of offerings. If the holy site is a glade, a stream one crosses along the way might serve as the repository, or a prominent bush or tree in the glade might be the place where people tie offerings. Typical offerings are broken weapons or items that are remembrances of arguments, which the faithful discard while making a wish for peace in the future. Many of those who favor Eldath are pacifists or people who are troubled by violence they have witnessed or experienced.": "大多数农村地区都有一个池塘或一个小树林，当地人把它归于埃尔德斯。传统上，它是一个安静思考的地方，其他人可以在那里进行思考。池塘或泉水等水体通常作为祭品的存放地。如果圣地是一片沼泽地，人们沿途经过的一条小溪可能会成为存放地，或者沼泽地中突出的灌木或树木可能是人们系上祭品的地方。典型的祭品是破损的武器或纪念争吵的物品，信徒们将其丢弃，同时许下未来和平的愿望。许多赞成Eldath的人都是和平主义者，或被他们所目睹或经历的暴力所困扰的人。",
	"Eldath's priests don't organize into large sects. Indeed, many are itinerant, wandering between various holy sites and shrines, seeing that the locations are cared for and that they remain places of sweet serenity. The faithful of Eldath are usually close to nature, and allied to druids, who count Eldath among the First Circle. It is taboo to strike a priest of Eldath, and killing one is said to bring great misfortune. Despite the measure of protection that this belief affords them, most priests of Eldath avoid conflicts rather than attempting to quell them. Those who serve Eldath are happy to preside over peaceful negotiations and to certify treaties, but they can't force others to engage in harmony.": "艾尔达斯的祭司们并没有组织成大的教派。事实上，很多人都是流动的，在各个圣地和神殿之间游荡，确保这些地方得到照顾，并保持甜蜜的宁静。艾尔达斯的信徒通常亲近自然，并与德鲁伊结盟，他们把艾尔达斯视为第一圈。打击艾尔达斯的牧师是一种禁忌，杀死一个牧师据说会带来巨大的不幸。尽管这种信仰为他们提供了一定程度的保护，但大多数艾尔达斯的牧师会避免冲突，而不是试图平息冲突。那些为艾尔达斯服务的人很乐意主持和平谈判并证明条约，但他们不能强迫他人参与和谐。",
	"the wonderbringer, the inspiration divine, the holy maker of all things": "神奇的使者，神圣的灵感，神圣的万物缔造者",
	"Gond is the god of artifice, craft, and construction. He is revered by blacksmiths, woodworkers, engineers, and inventors. Anyone who is crafting something might say a prayer to Gond to guide the work, but folk know that Gond smiles most brightly upon new inventions that others find useful.": "贡德是工匠、工艺和建筑之神。他受到铁匠、木匠、工程师和发明家的敬仰。任何正在制作东西的人都可能向冈德祈祷，以指导工作，但人们知道，冈德对别人认为有用的新发明笑得最灿烂。",
	"Priests of Gond wander the North dressed in saffron vestments, adorned with sashes that contain within their folds gears, locks, hooks, and bits of steel, tin, and wood that might prove useful in a pinch. They also wear belts of large, linked metal medallions and enormous sun hats. A traveling priest of Gond offers services to distant villages as a tinker, a carpenter, and a civil engineer rolled into one, ready to help build a better paddock gate, dig a new well, or mend pots or furniture that might otherwise go to waste. All priests of Gond keep journals in which they record ideas, inventions, and innovations discovered in their travels, and take great delight in meeting fellow priests and sharing their finds. In large cities, the Gondar construct temples that serve as great workshops and inventors' labs. Wandering priests turn their journals over to the resident scribes at such temples, who then record the priests' observations for posterity and the benefit of all.": "贡德的祭司们穿着藏红花法衣在北方游荡，装饰着腰带，腰带的褶皱里有齿轮、锁、钩子，以及在紧要关头可能证明有用的钢、锡和木头碎片。他们还戴着由大的、连在一起的金属奖章组成的腰带和巨大的太阳帽。贡德的旅行牧师向远方的村庄提供服务，就像一个工匠、一个木匠和一个土木工程师，随时准备帮助建造一个更好的围场门，挖一口新井，或者修补可能被浪费的锅或家具。贡德的所有牧师都会写日记，记录他们在旅行中发现的想法、发明和创新，并非常乐意与其他牧师会面，分享他们的发现。在大城市里，刚德人建造的寺庙是伟大的工作室和发明家的实验室。漂泊的祭司将他们的日记交给这些寺庙的常驻抄写员，然后他们将祭司们的观察记录下来，供后人参考，使所有人受益。",
	"Most who favor Gond practice time-honored crafting professions: they are smiths and engineers, architects and weavers, leatherworkers and jewelers. Even so, this faith has a well-earned reputation as a haven for crackpot inventors and visionaries.": "大多数支持贡德的人从事历史悠久的手工艺职业：他们是铁匠和工程师、建筑师和织工、皮革工和珠宝工。即便如此，这种信仰也有一个得来不易的声誉，那就是疯狂的发明家和幻想家的天堂。",
	"The center of Gond's worship on the Sword Coast lies in Baldur's Gate, where the faithful have erected two huge structures in honor of the Wonderbringer: a temple called the High House of Wonders and a museum of craft and design called the Hall of Wonders. Lantan had been the preeminent place of Gond's worship in the world until a century ago, when the island nation disappeared, and since its return the few Lantanese merchants seen in Sword Coast ports have said little about the present state of their homeland.": "冈德崇拜在剑海岸的中心位于博德之门，信徒们在那里建立了两座巨大的建筑来纪念神奇使者：一座名为奇迹高屋的神庙和一座名为奇迹大厅的工艺和设计博物馆。兰坦岛一直是贡德在世界上最重要的崇拜场所，直到一个世纪前，这个岛国消失了，自从它回来后，在剑海岸港口看到的少数兰坦商人对他们祖国的现状几乎只字不提。",
	"the mouth of mielikki, the master tracker, the tracker never led astray": "Mielikki之口，追踪大师，从未误入歧途的追踪者",
	"Few aside from rangers of the North pray to Gwaeron Windstrom. Said to have been a mortal man elevated to godhood by Mielikki, Gwaeron serves rangers as their intercessor with Mielikki. He is seen as a master ranger, the perfect tracker, a peerless animal handler, and a dedicated foe of rapacious creatures such as trolls and orcs. He is said to look like an old man with a long white beard who is still hale and mighty, and he is believed to take rest and sleep in a stand of trees near Triboar.": "除了北方的游骑兵外，很少有人向格瓦隆-温德斯特伦祈祷。据说格瓦隆是被米利基提升为神的凡人，他作为游骑兵与米利基的中间人为他们服务。他被视为一个游侠大师，完美的追踪者，无以伦比的动物管理人，以及巨魔和兽人等贪婪生物的忠实敌人。据说他看起来像一个长着白色胡须的老人，但仍然精神矍铄，据说他在特里波尔附近的树丛中休息和睡觉。",
	"Rangers pray to Gwaeron because he represents much of the work they do, and because he can speak to Mielikki on their behalf. In the North, most rangers view Mielikki as too mysterious, holy, and wild to be addressed directly with their requests, but they consider Gwaeron Windstrom to be one of them and thus understanding of their needs.": "游骑兵们向格瓦隆祈祷，因为他代表了他们所做的大部分工作，也因为他能代表他们向米利基说话。在北方，大多数游骑兵认为Mielikki太过神秘、神圣和野性，无法直接向他们提出要求，但他们认为Gwaeron Windstrom是他们中的一员，因此理解他们的需求。",
	"Gwaeron has no temples, but shrines dedicated to him can be found in many places that serve wilderness wanderers as trail markers. Each one is denoted by a carving of Gwaeron's symbol, a paw print with a star on the palm, on a prominent tree or stone.": "格瓦隆没有寺庙，但在许多地方都能找到供奉他的神龛，作为荒野流浪者的足迹标志。每一个神龛都有一个格瓦隆的标志，即在一棵突出的树或石头上雕刻一个手掌上有一颗星的爪印，以此来表示。",
	"the watcher, he of the unsleeping eyes, the vigilant one": "观察者，不眠的眼睛，警惕的人",
	"The god of vigilance and protection, Helm is seen as the epitome of the guardian, the watcher, and the guard. He is venerated by those who need to remain watchful for enemies or danger. Helm is a favorite deity of people who make a living by protecting someone or something, such as bodyguards, members of the city watch, and the guards of a treasury vault.": "赫尔姆是警戒和保护之神，被视为守护者、观察者和卫士的缩影。他被那些需要对敌人或危险保持警惕的人所敬仰。赫尔姆是那些以保护某人或某物为生的人最喜欢的神，如保镖、城市守望者和金库的守卫。",
	"Helm embodies the spirit of watchfulness without regard to good or evil. In legends, he is honorable and keeps his word to a fault, such as when he guarded the celestial stairways during the Time of Troubles, preventing the gods from ascending them and continuing the chaos of that period, until the Tablets of Fate were found.": "赫尔姆体现了不分善恶的守望精神。在传说中，他是可敬的，并在一定程度上遵守自己的诺言，比如在动乱时期，他守护着天梯，阻止众神登上天梯，延续了那个时期的混乱局面，直到找到命运之片。",
	"Although his faith has known dark days, worship of Helm never truly faded away. Most of his followers believe that the Watcher can never be vanquished utterly, and recent events have borne out that assertion.": "虽然他的信仰经历了黑暗的日子，但对赫尔姆的崇拜从未真正消退。他的大多数追随者认为，守望者永远不可能被彻底征服，最近的事件也证明了这一说法。",
	"Helm's priests teach that one must be ever vigilant, ever aware, ever prepared for one's enemies. Patience, clear thought, and careful planning will always defeat rushed actions in the end. Those who favor Helm strive to be alert, clear-headed, and true to their word. These traits don't necessarily make them nice people, however, and as such many consider the faithful of Helm to be inflexible and merciless.": "赫尔姆的牧师们教导说，人必须时刻保持警惕，时刻注意，时刻为自己的敌人做好准备。耐心、清晰的思考和周密的计划最终总能打败仓促的行动。赞成赫尔姆的人努力做到警觉、头脑清晰、言行一致。然而，这些特征并不一定使他们成为好人，因此，许多人认为赫尔姆的信徒是不灵活的、无情的。",
	"the doombringer, poet of justice": "末日使者，正义的诗人",
	"Hoar, known in the lands along the Inner Sea as Assuran, is a god of revenge and retribution. He isn't typically worshiped habitually, but his name is invoked by those who seek vengeance. When a guilty party falls prey to fate—such as when a murderer escapes prosecution, but is then accidentally slain himself—the hand of Hoar is given credit. When one hears three rolls of thunder in succession, it is thought to be a sign from Hoar that some act of vengeance has been performed. Many human societies have the custom of ringing a bell or a gong three times when judgment of a crime is rendered or an execution takes place.": "胡尔，在内海沿岸的土地上被称为阿苏兰，是一个复仇和报应之神。他通常不会被习惯性地崇拜，但他的名字会被那些寻求复仇的人所引用。当有罪的一方成为命运的猎物时--例如，当一个杀人犯逃脱了起诉，但自己却意外地被杀死时，胡尔的手就会被归功。当人们连续听到三声雷鸣时，人们认为这是胡尔的征兆，表明某种复仇行为已经完成。许多人类社会都有这样的习俗，即在对某一罪行作出判决或执行死刑时，敲响钟或锣三次。",
	"Folk speak Hoar's name when they want revenge, particularly when they are incapable of avenging themselves. This invocation might be in response to a petty slight or a true injustice, and the acknowledgment of Hoar might be a short prayer said aloud or might be written down somewhere. It's generally believed that the more permanent the form of the prayer, the more likely it is to be fulfilled. For this reason, some etch their prayers in lead and bury it or hide their prayers inside diaries. Aside from bounty hunters and those on crusades of vengeance, few truly revere Hoar, and he is served by fewer still who would call themselves priests. Temples or shrines of Hoar are almost nonexistent except for ancient sites in Chessenta and Unther.": "当人们想要报仇的时候，特别是当他们没有能力报仇的时候，就会说出胡尔的名字。这种召唤可能是为了回应一个小的轻视或真正的不公正，对胡尔的承认可能是一个简短的祈祷，大声说出来或可能写在某个地方。人们普遍认为，祈祷的形式越是永久，就越有可能实现。出于这个原因，有些人把他们的祈祷词刻在铅上并埋起来，或者把他们的祈祷词藏在日记本里。除了赏金猎人和那些复仇的十字军，很少有人真正崇敬霍尔，而自称是牧师的人就更少。除了Chessenta和Unther的古老遗址外，霍尔的寺庙或神龛几乎不存在。",
	"Hoar became a member of the Faerûnian pantheon when his worship extended beyond the lands that originally revered him. Most consider Tyr to be the arbiter of laws, and Hoar to be the god who metes out punishment that comes as a result of breaking those codes. A judge might favor the worship of Tyr, while a jailor or a headsman is more likely to pray to Hoar.": "当胡尔成为法鲁尼亚万神殿的一员时，他的崇拜已经超出了最初敬仰他的土地。大多数人认为泰尔是法律的仲裁者，而胡尔则是对违反这些法规的人进行惩罚的神。法官可能倾向于崇拜泰尔，而狱卒或头人则更倾向于向胡尔祈祷。",
	"the crying god, the rack-broken lord, he who endures": "哭泣的神，断裂的主，忍耐的人",
	"Ilmater is the god of suffering, martyrdom, and perseverance, renowned for his compassion and endurance. It is he who offers succor and calming words to those who are in pain, victimized, or in great need. He is the willing sufferer, the one who takes the place of another to heft the other's burden, to take the other's pain. He is the god of the oppressed and the unjustly treated.": "伊尔马特是苦难、殉道和坚忍之神，因其慈悲和忍耐而闻名。他为那些处于痛苦、受害或极度需要的人提供救助和安抚的话语。他是心甘情愿的受难者，是代替他人承担他人的负担，承受他人的痛苦的人。他是被压迫者和被不公正对待者的神。",
	"It is said that if he had his way, the Crying God would take all the suffering in the world onto himself, so as to spare others. Since he can't, he blesses those who endure on others' behalf, and he alleviates suffering when he can. Martyrs who die that others may live are always blessed by Ilmater with a final rest and reward in the god's afterlife, should they so choose.": "据说，如果他有办法的话，哭神会把世界上所有的苦难都揽到自己身上，这样就可以免除别人的痛苦。既然他不能这样做，他就祝福那些为他人忍受痛苦的人，并且在他能做到的时候减轻痛苦。为他人生存而牺牲的殉道者总是受到伊尔马特的祝福，在神的来世得到最后的休息和奖赏，如果他们选择这样做的话。",
	"Ilmater's priests take in the ill, the starving, and the injured, and his temples give most of what they receive to help offset the suffering of the world. His followers provide succor when they can, but also use force to put an end to torture and suffering inflicted on others. Ilmater's priests travel to places where the worst possible conditions exist, ministering to the needs of the oppressed, the deceased, and the poor. They put others ahead of themselves, are sharing of all they have, and emphasize the spiritual nature of life over the welfare of the material body.": "伊尔马特的牧师收留病人、饥饿者和受伤者，他的寺庙将他们收到的大部分东西用于帮助抵消世界的痛苦。他的追随者在可能的情况下提供救助，但也使用武力来结束对他人的折磨和痛苦。伊尔马特的牧师们前往条件最恶劣的地方，为受压迫者、死者和穷人的需要提供服务。他们把别人放在自己前面，分享他们所拥有的一切，并强调生命的精神本质而不是物质身体的福利。",
	"Priests of Ilmater who are on a quest to aid others can be recognized by their hair shirts, vests of coarse fur worn against the bare skin. It is taboo to harm such priests as they go about their duties, such as when they administer to the wounded on a battlefield. The taboo is so strongly felt among humans that other races respect the custom. Even orcs and goblinoids will avoid directly attacking a peaceful priest of Ilmater, as long as the priest administers to their fallen warriors as well.": "伊尔马特的祭司们在执行援助他人的任务时，可以通过他们的毛衣来识别，毛衣是用粗糙的毛皮穿在裸露的皮肤上的背心。伤害这些牧师是禁忌，因为他们在履行职责时，例如在战场上对伤员进行治疗。这种禁忌在人类中是如此强烈，以至于其他种族也尊重这种习俗。即使是兽人和地精也会避免直接攻击和平的伊尔马特祭司，只要该祭司也为他们死去的战士进行治疗。",
	"Most folk deeply respect the work and the sacrifice of Ilmater's faith, and lend aid to such endeavors where they can. When a temple of Ilmater sends its faithful to help refugees of war or victims of plague, their willingness to sacrifice their own well-being always prompts ordinary people to support them, whether they are inspired or shamed into action.": "大多数人对伊尔马特信仰的工作和牺牲深表敬意，并在力所能及的范围内为这种努力提供援助。当伊尔马特的寺庙派其信徒去帮助战争难民或瘟疫受害者时，他们愿意牺牲自己的福祉，总是促使普通人支持他们，无论他们是受到鼓舞还是被羞辱而采取行动。",

	"Legend has it that Jergal is an ancient deity. The story goes that in the time of Netheril he was worshiped as the god of death, murder, and strife. Yet with the passing of time, he became bored with his position. Then one day three mortals, each a powerful adventurer, met Jergal in the lands of the dead, determined to destroy him and take his power. Instead, Jergal calmly abdicated his throne of bones and allowed each of the three mortals to take part of his divinity. Thus it was that Bane assumed the portfolio of strife, Myrkul the rulership of the dead, and Bhaal the portfolio of murder. Jergal lost his former stature and became a scribe of the dead.": "传说Jergal是一个古老的神灵。故事说，在尼瑟尔时代，他被当作死亡、谋杀和争斗之神来崇拜。然而随着时间的流逝，他对自己的地位感到厌烦。然后有一天，三个凡人，每一个都是强大的冒险家，在亡灵之地遇到了杰格尔，决心摧毁他，夺取他的权力。相反，杰格尔平静地放弃了他的白骨王座，并允许这三个凡人中的每个人都能获得他的一部分神性。就这样，贝恩承担了争斗的职责，米尔库尔承担了亡灵的统治权，而巴尔则承担了谋杀的职责。耶格尔失去了他以前的地位，成了亡灵的抄写员。",
	"Jergal is now seen as an uncaring custodian of the dead. He is thought to record the passing of the living and to aid Kelemvor in seeing that souls are properly bound to their appropriate afterlife. He is rarely acknowledged directly, except for being mentioned at funerals and among those who practice the custom of writing the name of the deceased on a sheet of parchment and placing it in the corpse's mouth. This rite is common in places where an individual's grave or tomb isn't marked with the person's name.": "Jergal现在被看作是一个无情的死者监护人。他被认为是记录生者的逝去，并帮助凯勒莫尔看到灵魂被适当地束缚在他们适当的来世。他很少被直接承认，除了在葬礼上被提及，以及在那些实行将死者的名字写在羊皮纸上并放入尸体口中的习俗的人中。这种仪式在个人的坟墓或墓穴没有标明个人姓名的地方很常见。",
	"Few people favor Jergal as a deity, and most who do are concerned with the dispensation of the dead in some way. Priests of Jergal serve communities as undertakers and caretakers of gravesites. Jergal has no temples dedicated to him aside from abandoned places devoted to his old, darker incarnation, but his priests are welcome in the temples of Kelemvor, Deneir, and Myrkul. His faithful send their annual recordings of mortality to holy sites where records of that sort are kept.": "很少有人把耶加勒当作神灵，而大多数人都以某种方式关注死者的分配问题。杰尔加的祭司们作为殡仪馆和墓地的看护人为社区服务。除了专门供奉他的古老而黑暗的化身的废弃场所外，杰加尔没有专门供奉他的庙宇，但他的祭司在凯勒莫、迪内尔和米尔库尔的庙宇中受到欢迎。他的信徒们每年都会把他们的死亡记录送到保存有此类记录的圣地。",
	"Long ago there was but one god of strife, death, and the dead, and he was known as Jergal, Lord of the End of Everything. Jergal fomented and fed on the discord among mortals and deific entities alike. When beings slew each other in their quest for power or in their hatred, he welcomed them into his shadowy kingdom of eternal gloom. As all things died, everything came to him eventually, and over time he built a kingdom unchallenged by any other god. But he grew tired of his duties, for he knew them too well, and without challenge there is nothing—and in nothingness there is only gloom. In such a state, the difference between absolute power and absolute powerlessness is undetectable.": "很久以前，只有一个掌管纷争、死亡和亡灵的神，他被称为 \"Jergal\"，万物之灵。杰格尔在凡人和神灵之间煽动和滋生不和。当众生为了追求权力或仇恨而互相残杀时，他欢迎他们进入他那阴暗的永恒的黑暗王国。随着万物的消亡，一切最终都归于他，随着时间的推移，他建立了一个没有任何其他神灵可以挑战的王国。但他逐渐厌倦了他的职责，因为他太了解这些职责了，没有挑战就没有一切--在虚无中只有阴暗。在这种状态下，绝对的权力和绝对的无权之间的区别是无法察觉的。",
	"During this dark era arose three powerful mortals—Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul—who lusted after the power Jergal possessed. The trio forged an unholy pact that they would gain such ultimate power or die in the attempt. Over the length and breadth of the world they strode, seeking powerful magic and spells and defying death at every turn. No matter what monster they confronted or what spells they braved, the three mortals emerged unscathed at every turn. Eventually, the trio journeyed into the Gray Waste and sought out the Castle of Bone. Through armies of skeletons, legions of zombies, hordes of wraiths, and a gauntlet of liches they battled. Eventually they reached the object of their lifelong quest—the Bone Throne.": "在这个黑暗的时代，出现了三个强大的凡人--贝恩（Bane）、巴尔（Bhaal）和米尔库尔（Myrkul），他们渴望获得杰格尔拥有的力量。这三个人订立了一个不神圣的协议，他们将获得这种终极力量，否则就会死在这里。他们走遍了世界的各个角落，寻求强大的魔法和法术，并处处不畏死亡。无论他们面对的是什么怪物，也无论他们面对的是什么法术，这三个凡人每次都毫发无伤。最终，三人进入灰色荒原，寻找骨之城堡。他们在骷髅大军、僵尸军团、成群结队的巫师和地衣的包围中战斗。最终，他们到达了他们毕生追求的目标--白骨王座。",
	"\"I claim this throne of evil,\" Bane the tyrant shouted to Jergal.": "\"我要求这个邪恶的宝座，\"暴君班恩对杰格尔喊道。",
	"\"I'll destroy you before you can raise a finger,\" threatened Bhaal the assassin.": "\"我会在你举起手指之前摧毁你，\"刺客巴尔威胁道。",
	"\"And I shall imprison your essence for eternity,\" promised Myrkul the necromancer.": "\"而我将永远囚禁你的精华，\"死灵法师米尔库尔承诺。",
	"Jergal arose from his throne with a weary expression and said, \"The throne is yours. I have grown weary of this empty power. Take it if you wish—l promise to serve and guide you as your seneschal until you grow comfortable with the position.\" Then, before the stunned trio could react, the Lord of the Dead asked, \"Who among you shall rule?\"": "耶哥从他的宝座上站起来，露出疲惫的表情，说：\"宝座是你的。我已经对这种空洞的权力感到厌倦了。如果你愿意，就拿去吧，我保证作为你的参谋为你服务并指导你，直到你对这个位置感到舒服为止。\" 然后，在目瞪口呆的三人做出反应之前，亡灵之主问道：\"你们中谁将统治？\"",
	"The trio immediately fell to fighting among themselves while Jergal looked on with indifference. When eventually it appeared that either they would all die of exhaustion or battle on for an eternity, the Lord of the End of Everything intervened.": "这三个人立即陷入了彼此之间的争斗，而杰格尔则冷眼旁观。当最终看来，要么他们都会因疲惫而死，要么就会永远战斗下去时，万物终结之主进行了干预。",
	"\"After all you have sacrificed, would you come away with nothing? Why don't you divide the portfolios of the office by engaging in a game of skill for them?\" asked Jergal.": "\"在你们牺牲了那么多之后，你们会一无所获吗？你为什么不通过为他们搞一场技巧游戏来划分办公室的投资组合呢？\"耶格尔问。",
	"Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul considered the god's offer and agreed to it. So Jergal took the skulls of his three most powerful liches and gave them to the trio so they could compete in skull bowling. Each mortal rolled a skull across the Gray Waste, having agreed that the winner would be he who bowled the farthest.": "班恩、巴尔和米尔库尔考虑了神的提议并同意了。于是，杰格尔把他的三个最强大的地衣的头骨给了他们三人，这样他们就可以在头骨保龄球比赛中一决高下。每个凡人都将一个头骨滚过灰色荒原，并约定谁打得最远谁就是赢家。",
	"Malar the Beastlord arrived to visit Jergal at this moment. After quickly ascertaining that the winner of the contest would receive all of Jergal's power, he chased off after the three skulls to make sure that the contest would be halted until he had a chance to participate for part of the prize. Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul again fell to fighting, as it was obvious their sport had been ruined, but again Jergal intervened. \"Why don't you allow Lady Luck to decide, so you don't have to share with the Beast?\"": "兽王马拉尔这时赶来拜访杰尔格。在迅速确定比赛的获胜者将获得杰格尔的全部力量后，他追着那三个骷髅头走了，以确保比赛停止，直到他有机会参与其中以获得部分奖励。贝恩、巴哈尔和米尔库尔再次陷入争斗，因为很明显他们的运动已经被破坏了，但杰尔格再次进行干预。\"你为什么不让幸运女神来决定，这样你就不用和野兽分享了？\"",
	"The trio agreed to this alternative, and Jergal broke off his skeletal finger bones and gave them to the contestants. When Malar returned from chasing the skulls, he found that the trio had just finished a game of knucklebones.": "三人组同意了这个备选方案，杰格尔掰下自己的骷髅指骨，送给了参赛者。当马拉尔追赶骷髅头回来时，发现三人组刚刚结束了一场指骨游戏。",
	"Bane cried out triumphantly, \"As winner, I choose to rule for all eternity as the ultimate tyrant. I can induce hatred and strife at my whim, and all will bow down before me while in my kingdom.\"": "班恩胜利地喊道：\"作为胜利者，我选择作为最终的暴君来统治所有的永恒。我可以随心所欲地诱发仇恨和纷争，在我的王国里，所有人都会在我面前俯首称臣。\"",
	"Myrkul, who had won second place, declared, \"But I choose the dead, and by doing so I truly win, because all that you are lord over, Bane, will eventually be mine. All things must die—even gods.\"": "赢得第二名的米尔库尔宣布：\"但我选择了死人，这样做我就真正赢了，因为你所主宰的一切，贝恩，最终将是我的。所有的东西都必须死，即使是神。\"",
	"Bhaal, who finished third, proclaimed, \"I choose death, and it is by my hand that all that you rule, Lord Bane, will eventually pass to Lord Myrkul. Both of you must pay honor to me and obey my wishes, since I can destroy your kingdom, Bane, by murdering your subjects, and I can starve your kingdom, Myrkul, by staying my hand.\"": "获得第三名的Bhaal宣称：\"我选择死亡，正是通过我的手，班恩大人你所统治的一切，最终将传给Myrkul大人。你们两个人都必须向我表示敬意，并服从我的意愿，因为我可以通过谋杀你的臣民来摧毁你的王国，班恩，而我可以通过留手来饿死你的王国，米尔库尔。\"",
	"Malar growled in frustration, but could do nothing, and so yet again only the beasts were left for him.": "马拉尔沮丧地咆哮着，但却无能为力，因此又一次只剩下野兽给他了。",
	"And Jergal merely smiled, for he had been delivered.": "耶格尔只是笑了笑，因为他已经得到了释放。",
	"the lord of the dead, the judge of the damned": "死者的主宰，被诅咒者的审判者",
	"Kelemvor is seen as a just, fair, and comforting god of death. Death comes to all, and when it occurs Kelemvor is there to take each soul by the hand and lead it to the proper afterlife. Kelemvor's priests teach that those who revere the gods according to the rites of their religion have done their proper service and will be offered the afterlife they seek.": "凯勒莫被视为一个公正、公平和令人欣慰的死神。死亡降临到所有人身上，而当死亡发生时，凯勒莫会在那里牵着每个灵魂的手，将其引向适当的来世。Kelemvor的祭司们教导说，那些按照他们的宗教仪式敬畏神灵的人已经做了适当的服务，并将获得他们所寻求的来世。",
	"The faithful of Kelemvor provide people with peaceful transitions into the care of the Lord of the Dead. They help the dying put their affairs in order, and they officiate at funeral rites for those who can't afford the lavish ceremonies of their faith. The tenets of Kelemvor's faithful compel them to forestall or prevent untimely deaths whenever possible. Different sects and worshipers define \"untimely\" in different ways. One group might concentrate on stopping the spread of disease, another on the prevention of murder, and yet another on eliminating the scourge of the undead. In fact, all the faithful of Kelemvor despise the undead and work to some degree to eliminate them, for undead of any sort are seen as an abomination of the natural order. This belief obviously puts Kelemvor's faithful at odds with necromancers, priests of Myrkul, and others who promote the creation of the undead, and it also causes conflict from unexpected sources. For instance, priests of Kelemvor routinely destroy any writings about the creation of the undead that they find—an act that offends those who value knowledge for its own sake, such as the faithful of Oghma and Deneir. And there also exist undead that aren't evil, such as the baelnorn, which the elves consider holy. Kelemvor's devotees seek the end of such beings regardless of that fact.": "Kelemvor的信众为人们提供和平过渡到亡灵之主的照顾。他们帮助濒临死亡的人把他们的事情安排好，并为那些负担不起他们信仰的奢华仪式的人主持葬礼仪式。凯勒莫的信徒的信条迫使他们尽可能地阻止或防止过早的死亡。不同的教派和崇拜者以不同的方式定义 \"不合时宜\"。一个团体可能专注于阻止疾病的传播，另一个专注于防止谋杀，还有一个专注于消除亡灵的祸害。事实上，所有Kelemvor的信徒都鄙视亡灵，并在某种程度上努力消除它们，因为任何形式的亡灵都被视为对自然秩序的憎恶。这种信仰显然使凯勒莫的信徒与死灵法师、米尔库尔的祭司以及其他提倡创造亡灵的人产生了矛盾，同时也造成了来自意想不到的冲突。例如，凯勒莫的牧师经常销毁他们发现的任何有关创造亡灵的著作--这种行为冒犯了那些为了知识而重视知识的人，比如奥格玛和迪尼尔的信徒。也有一些不邪恶的亡灵，比如精灵们认为神圣的baelnorn。凯勒莫的信徒们不顾这一事实，寻求这种生命的终结。",
	"the morninglord, inspiration's dawn, the rose-and-gold god": "晨曦之主，灵感的曙光，玫瑰和金色的上帝",
	"Lathander is the god of the spring, birth, and renewal, a deity of conception, vitality, youth, renewal, and self-perfection. He is god not of the sun but of the dawn, which represents the start of a new day filled with potential.": "拉桑德是春天、出生和复兴之神，是孕育、活力、年轻、更新和自我完善的神。他不是太阳之神，而是黎明之神，代表着充满潜力的新一天的开始。",
	"Lathander is a god of beginnings. People commonly offer a prayer to him before undertaking any journey or endeavor. Lathander's name is invoked to seal alliances and christen new ventures or companies. As a result, the god is very popular among the merchant classes, and the church has benefited accordingly.": "拉桑德是一个开始之神。人们在进行任何旅行或努力之前通常会向他祈祷。拉桑德的名字被用来封印联盟和为新的企业或公司洗礼。因此，该神在商人阶层中非常受欢迎，而教会也因此受益。",
	"The rising sun is his symbol, and his colors are the rose, gold, and violet of the dawn. Lathander's temples and shrines host a wide range of functions both municipal and personal. At such places folk get married in dawn ceremonies, announce the start of civic projects, and even give birth when possible, to provide the baby good fortune.": "旭日是他的象征，他的颜色是黎明的玫瑰色、金色和紫色。拉桑德的寺庙和神殿承载着广泛的功能，包括市政和个人。在这些地方，人们在黎明仪式上结婚，宣布公民项目的开始，甚至在可能的情况下分娩，以提供婴儿的好运。",
	"The faithful of Lathander embrace the founding of new communities and the growth of civilization, as long as that civilization gives everyone the potential to succeed. They despise the undead, seeing them as both a corruption of the natural order and a disavowal of new beginnings, because undead cling to their old existence rather than moving on.": "拉桑德的信徒们拥护新社区的建立和文明的发展，只要这种文明给了每个人成功的潜力。他们鄙视亡灵，认为它们既是对自然秩序的破坏，也是对新的开始的否定，因为亡灵坚持他们原来的存在而不是继续前进。",
	"the lady of the mists, mistshadow, the lady of deception": "迷雾中的女人, 迷雾中的女人, 欺骗的女人",
	"Leira has worn many masks, and more than once has been thought to be dead or to be another deity altogether. Perhaps such a reputation is only natural for the goddess of illusion and deception. Her faithful agree that whatever the \"truth\" might be, their Lady takes great delight in the confusion sown by her various incarnations. Even the faithful of Cyric once taught that their god killed Leira, but now they espouse the strange idea that somehow she is his daughter.": "莱拉戴过很多面具，而且不止一次被认为已经死亡或完全是另一个神灵。也许这样的声誉对幻觉和欺骗的女神来说是很自然的。她的信徒们同意，无论 \"真相 \"是什么，他们的夫人对她的各种化身所造成的混乱感到非常高兴。即使是西里奇的信徒也曾教导说他们的神杀死了莱拉，但现在他们支持一种奇怪的想法，即她是他的女儿。",
	"Leira isn't viewed as malicious or as a trickster but is seen as enigmatic, quiet, and retiring. She is credited with inventing Ruathlek, the language of illusionists and the spoken tongue of Nimbral.": "莱拉并不被认为是恶意的，也不被认为是诡计多端的人，而是被认为是神秘的、安静的、隐忍的。她被认为是发明了Ruathlek，即幻术师的语言和Nimbral的口头语言。",
	"The faithful of Leira seem to be scarce, although it is difficult to know this for certain, because those who favor her rarely make their inclinations known. Leira is the patron of illusionists and liars. She receives little regular worship except from illusionists, who pray to the Mistshadow for potency in their magic, and con artists, for whom she is a kind of champion. Most people pray to her when they hope to keep something secret, or placate her with a prayer before making an important decision when they fear being deceived. Some folk perform a swirling motion with a finger behind their backs when telling a lie as a way of beseeching her for aid.": "莱拉的信徒似乎很少，尽管很难确定这一点，因为那些支持她的人很少公开他们的倾向。莱拉是幻术师和说谎者的守护神。除了幻术师和骗子之外，她几乎没有收到任何常规的崇拜，幻术师向雾影祈祷，希望他们的魔法能有效力，而骗子则是她的一种支持者。大多数人在希望保守秘密时都会向她祈祷，或者在做出重要决定前担心被欺骗时用祈祷来安抚她。有些人在说谎话时用手指在背后做旋转动作，以此来祈求她的帮助。",
	"Her priests wear vestments of white and mist-gray, and their faces are covered by smooth, featureless masks. Only in Nimbral do temples to Leira exist, and shrines dedicated to her found across the continent are usually disguised as other kinds of sites, marked with signs that only the faithful would recognize.": "她的祭司穿着白色和雾灰色的法衣，他们的脸被光滑的、没有特征的面具所覆盖。只有在宁布拉尔才有雷拉的神庙，而在整个大陆上发现的供奉她的神庙通常被伪装成其他类型的场所，用只有信徒才能识别的标志来标示。",
	"our lady of joy, joybringer, the mistress of revels": "我们的欢乐女士，欢乐使者，狂欢的女主人",
	"Lliira is a beloved goddess, a deity of contentment, release, joy, happiness, dance, and freedom. As the patron of festivals, she is honored at any celebration, and dance is the primary way to worship her. The Mistress of Revels is said to abhor violence, and any fighting or drawing of weapons (except in ceremony) at a celebration will cause her to withhold her favor. Her priests and priestesses, known as joybringers, take it as their mission to make other people happy, even if just for a moment.": "莉莉拉是一位受人爱戴的女神，她是满足、释放、快乐、幸福、舞蹈和自由的神灵。作为节日的守护神，她在任何庆典上都受到尊敬，而舞蹈是崇拜她的主要方式。据说狂欢节的女主人憎恶暴力，在庆典上的任何打斗或拔出武器（仪式除外）都会引起她的不满。她的牧师和女祭司被称为 \"欢乐使者\"，他们把让别人快乐作为自己的使命，哪怕只是一瞬间。",
	"Her faithful always wear at least one clothing item of a bright, cheerful color, and her priests' vestments have more in common with festival attire than with somber ecclesial garments. Rubies and sapphires are sacred to Our Lady of Joy, and her priests bless anyone they see wearing such adornments.": "她的信徒总是至少穿一件颜色鲜艳、欢快的衣服，她的牧师的法衣与节日服装有更多的共同之处，而不是与阴沉的教会服装。红宝石和蓝宝石对欢乐圣母来说是神圣的，她的牧师们看到任何佩戴这种装饰品的人都会给予祝福。",
	"Lliira's followers aren't frivolous, however. To them, divine joy is a very real gift to the world of mortals, and one much needed. To that end, they fight those who would bring misery to others. They are fierce against their foes, and joyous revelers when their work is done.": "然而，Lliira的追随者并不轻佻。对他们来说，神圣的快乐是给凡人世界的一个非常真实的礼物，而且是非常需要的。为此，他们与那些会给他人带来痛苦的人战斗。他们猛烈地打击敌人，当他们的工作完成后，又是快乐的狂欢者。",
	"the maiden of pain, the scourge mistress, the willing whip": "痛苦的少女，祸害的女主人，自愿的鞭子",
	"Pain isn't a means to an end for Loviatar's faithful, but an end unto itself. To them, nothing is as transcendent as suffering, and all pain is holy, from the crudest barbarism, to the most sublime torture, to the emotional suffering of the heartbroken or the betrayed.": "痛苦对洛菲亚塔的信徒来说不是达到目的的手段，而是目的本身。对他们来说，没有什么比痛苦更超然的了，所有的痛苦都是神圣的，从最粗暴的野蛮，到最崇高的折磨，到伤心人或被背叛者的情感痛苦。",
	"The pain that one feels is proof of the Lady's attention, and so her faithful are notorious self-flagellants. Pain is also a path to power, in terms of both one's ability to inflict it and one's ability to endure it. A cold, cruel demeanor is considered ideal because it best emulates the Scourge Mistress, and for the same reason her faithful appreciate beauty, cultural refinement, and a certain adeptness at manipulation.": "一个人感受到的痛苦是夫人关注的证明，因此她的信徒是臭名昭著的自我鞭挞者。痛苦也是通往权力的途径，就一个人施加痛苦的能力和忍受痛苦的能力而言。冷酷无情的举止被认为是最理想的，因为它最能模仿祸害女主人，同样的原因，她的信众也欣赏美貌、文化修养和某种操纵的熟练程度。",
	"Though temples to Loviatar are rare, her faithful are more numerous than might be expected. Loviatar is the chosen deity of those who inflict pain as a matter of course, including torturers and others who need to break the will of their victims. She is favored by sadists and masochists, and some of her followers form cultish cells of secret adherents. Each of these groups is led by someone who takes pleasure in administering pain and dominating others, supported and backed up by a number of submissive sycophants.": "虽然洛菲塔尔的庙宇很少，但她的信徒却比想象中要多得多。洛菲亚塔是那些把痛苦当做理所当然的事情的人所选择的神灵，包括施虐者和其他需要摧毁受害者意志的人。她受到虐待狂和受虐狂的青睐，她的一些追随者形成了秘密信徒的邪教细胞。这些团体中的每一个都是由一个以实施痛苦和支配他人为乐的人领导，并由一些顺从的佞臣支持和支援。",
	"Worshipers of Loviatar rarely gather in numbers except in the more populous cities. When small cadres of faithful operate quietly in such places, few citizens take notice or raise a fuss if they do witness cult activity. The sufferers who endure the lash, however, aren't always willing participants, and Lovatar's cults sometimes operate secret slavery rings, which can draw the attention of the authorities. The open worship of Loviatar and temples clearly dedicated to her are rarely seen except in lands where slavery is an accepted practice.": "除了在人口较多的城市，洛维塔的崇拜者很少聚集在一起。当一小群信徒在这些地方悄悄地活动时，很少有市民注意到，或者在他们看到邪教活动时大惊小怪。然而，忍受鞭打的受难者并不总是心甘情愿地参与，洛瓦塔的邪教有时会运作秘密的奴役团伙，这可能引起当局的注意。除了在奴隶制被接受的地方，很少看到对洛瓦塔尔的公开崇拜和明显献给她的寺庙。",
	"the beastlord, the black-blooded one": "兽王，黑血的人",
	"Malar epitomizes the dark side of nature, the world that is red in tooth and claw. His faithful believe the hunt is the center point between life and death—the facing off of hunter and prey, forcing the issue of who lives and who dies. People believe that Malar can't be propitiated and knows no mercy, so he receives prayers only from those engaging in a hunt. Such supplicants pray to Malar for two reasons: to beg the aid of his peerless skill as a hunter, or to adopt his fearsome mantle and thus ward off other predators. Malar is the god of those who delight in the hunt, don't shy from bloodshed, and savor the fear of their prey.": "马拉尔是自然界黑暗面的缩影，是张牙舞爪的世界。他的信徒认为狩猎是生与死之间的中心点--猎人与猎物的对峙，迫使谁生谁死的问题。人们相信马拉尔不能被祭祀，也不知道怜悯，所以他只接受那些参与狩猎的人的祈祷。这些祈求者向马拉尔祈祷有两个原因：乞求他作为猎人的无敌技能的帮助，或者采用他可怕的衣钵，从而抵御其他掠夺者。马拉尔是那些以狩猎为乐、不避讳流血、享受猎物恐惧的人的神。",
	"Many lycanthropes consider Malar to be their divine father, as do some other intelligent predators. He has many devotees who are druids and rangers of particularly savage inclination, and many barbarians take Malar as a patron for his ferocity and cruelty. His priests use claw bracers, impressive gauntlets bedecked with stylized claws that jut out from the ends of the fists, as ceremonial weapons.": "许多狼人认为马拉尔是他们神圣的父亲，其他一些聪明的掠夺者也是如此。他有许多信徒，他们是德鲁伊和具有特别野蛮倾向的游侠，许多野蛮人把马拉尔作为他凶猛和残忍的守护者。他的祭司使用爪子手镯，令人印象深刻的铠甲，上面有从拳头末端伸出的风格化的爪子，作为仪式上的武器。",
	"the lord of shadows, the master of all thieves": "影子的主人，所有盗贼的主人",
	"Mask is a trickster god, the patron of ne'er-do-wells, spies, and thieves. All that occurs within shadow is in the purview of Mask.

	"Those who favor Mask usually pursue thievery and other forms of acquisition of what belongs to others, such as pickpocketing, burglary, mugging, and con games. Ordinary folk pray to him to avert his eyes from their valuables, but the cautious sometimes employ \"Mask's purse,\" a small, cheap cloth pouch worn in plain sight (thus easily cut or lifted) containing a small offering of coin. By convention, a pickpocket pilfers Mask's purse when encountering another person wearing one, and considers the gain a gift from the god, while the one who lost the purse is grateful to the Lord of Shadows for accepting a respectful sacrifice of a small portion of his goods. Of course, nothing prevents another pickpocket from targeting someone who has lost Mask's purse, but anyone with the ill luck to attract multiple pickpockets in a single outing has probably earned Mask's ire anyway.": "那些支持面具的人通常追求盗窃和其他形式的获取属于他人的东西，如扒窃、入室盗窃、抢劫和骗局。普通人向他祈祷，希望他能避开他们的贵重物品，但谨慎的人有时会使用 \"面具的钱包\"，这是一个廉价的小布袋，戴在明处（因此很容易被切割或提起），里面装着少量硬币。按照惯例，扒手在遇到另一个戴着面具的人时，会偷取面具的钱包，并认为这是神的礼物，而丢失钱包的人则感谢阴影之神接受了他一小部分货物的恭敬祭品。当然，没有什么能阻止另一个扒手把目标放在丢了面具钱包的人身上，但任何运气不好的人，在一次出游中吸引了多个扒手，都可能赢得了面具的愤怒。",
	"Priests of Mask are usually thieves by profession, and often serve as higher-ups in the local underworld or criminal syndicate. They go by the title of demarche or demarchess, and wear veil-masks when acting in their priestly capacity.": "面具祭司通常是以盗贼为职业，并经常在当地黑社会或犯罪集团中担任高级职务。他们的头衔是Demarche或Demarchess，以牧师身份行事时戴着面纱面具。",
	"our lady of the forest, the forest queen": "我们的森林女士，森林女王",
	"People rarely speak of Mielikki except in quiet forest spaces. Woodlands that evoke wonder are where she reigns supreme, but she is said to keep watch over good folk in any forest, not matter how dark or cruel. When children are lost in the woods, people beseech Mielikki to protect them until they are found.": "除了在安静的森林空间，人们很少谈论米利基。唤起人们好奇心的林地是她统治的地方，但据说她在任何森林里都能看护善良的人们，不管多么黑暗或残酷。当孩子们在森林里迷路时，人们会祈求米利基保护他们，直到他们被找到。",
	"Mielikki is the goddess of the forest and the creatures that live within it. She is seen as a remote and spiritual deity—less human-like than many other gods. She's not unmindful of people, but her attention and favor are difficult to attract. She is the patron of rangers in the same way that Milil is the patron of bards, but even rangers rarely pray to her directly. They instead pray to Gwaeron Windstrom, who they believe will carry their words to the goddess by tracking her to whichever forest she hides in.": "米利基是森林和生活在森林中的生物的女神。她被视为一个遥远而精神的神灵--比许多其他神灵更不像人。她并不是不关心人，但她的注意力和宠爱很难吸引。她是游侠的守护神，就像米利尔是吟游诗人的守护神一样，但即使游侠也很少直接向她祈祷。他们转而向格瓦隆-温德斯特伦（Gwaeron Windstrom）祈祷，他们相信格瓦隆-温德斯特伦会把他们的话带到女神那里，跟踪她到她所藏身的森林。",
	"Mielikki's symbol is a unicorn, which prompts some to think of her as such and conflate her with Lurue, Queen of the Unicorns and the actual goddess of their kind. But most tales depict Mielikki as a beautiful woman whom Lurue allows upon her back as a rider, and the two are thought to be boon companions. Mielikki's relationships with other deities of the natural world are more complex. Silvanus is sometimes thought of as her father and Eldath is considered her sister, but Mielikki walks her own path through the wilds.": "米利基的标志是一只独角兽，这使一些人认为她是独角兽，并将她与独角兽女王和它们的实际女神卢鲁伊混为一谈。但大多数故事将米利基描绘成一个美丽的女人，鲁鲁修允许她作为骑手骑在背上，两人被认为是好伙伴。米利基与自然界的其他神灵的关系更为复杂。希尔瓦娜斯有时被认为是她的父亲，艾尔达斯被认为是她的姐姐，但米利基在荒野中走着自己的路。",
	"She has many shrines, particularly in the Savage Frontier. Most consist of a dead tree trunk into which has been carved a likeness of her holy symbol, a unicorn's head. Alternatively, the likeness might be carved on a separate piece of wood and tacked to a living tree. These shrines typically mark the point in a forest beyond which locals know not to cut timber or hunt. Often these tributes are created by loggers at the end of a logging excursion as a mark of thanks to the goddess for providing the wood and for keeping the timber cutters safe during the work.": "她有许多神龛，特别是在野蛮人的边境地区。大多数都是由一棵枯树干组成，上面刻着她的神圣象征--独角兽的头像。或者，这个肖像可能被刻在一块单独的木头上，然后粘在一棵活树上。这些神龛通常标志着森林中的一个点，当地人知道超过这个点就不能砍伐木材或狩猎。这些神龛通常是由伐木工人在伐木结束后创建的，以感谢女神提供木材并在工作中保证伐木工人的安全。",
	"the lord of song, the one true hand of all-wise oghma": "歌声的主宰，全智的奥格玛的真正之手",
	"Milil is the god of poetry, eloquence, and song. He is a god of creativity and inspiration, of the entire song more than just the lyrics or the music. He represents the finished thought, the result of the process that takes an idea from conception to realization. Milil is most venerated by bards, troubadours, and other entertainers, but anyone preparing to entertain or speak before a crowd might offer Milil a brief prayer for a successful performance. Those who seek inspiration in a creative endeavor also pray to Milil.": "米利尔是诗歌、口才和歌曲之神。他是创意和灵感之神，是整首歌的神，而不仅仅是歌词或音乐。他代表完成的思想，是一个想法从构思到实现的过程的结果。米利尔最受吟游诗人、游吟诗人和其他艺人的敬仰，但任何准备在众人面前表演或讲话的人都可以向米利尔作简短的祈祷，以获得成功的表演。那些在创造性工作中寻求灵感的人也向米利尔祈祷。",
	"His icons depict him as a handsome male, sometimes a human, sometimes an elf, and even a half-elf in places (such as Aglarond) that have a large half-elf population. He is variously depicted as young or old, but his identity is always apparent because of his five-stringed harp made of silvery leaves, which he carries constantly. He is the ideal to which all performers aspire: poised and confident, winningly charismatic, and a source of inspiration for those who listen to him. He is said to have total recall of anything he hears or that is spoken while music plays, as well as utmost skill at improvisation.": "他的图标将他描绘成一个英俊的男性，有时是人类，有时是精灵，在有大量半精灵人口的地方（如阿格拉隆），甚至是半精灵。他被描述为年轻或年老，但他的身份总是显而易见的，因为他的五弦琴是由银色的树叶制成的，他一直带着它。他是所有表演者所向往的理想：姿态自信，魅力四射，是聆听他的人的灵感来源。据说，他能完全记住他所听到的或在音乐播放时所说的任何东西，并具有极强的即兴创作能力。",
	"Holy sites dedicated to Milil are often found in performance venues and schools of music. Whether the site is a vast concert hall or a small choral chamber, it must have excellent acoustic qualities. Milil's priests are patrons of the arts in addition to being performers themselves, and they frequently act as tutors in the arts of performance at his shrines and temples.": "献给米利尔的圣地经常出现在表演场所和音乐学校中。无论该场所是一个巨大的音乐厅还是一个小的合唱室，它都必须有良好的声学质量。米利尔的祭司除了自己是表演者外，还是艺术的赞助人，他们经常在他的神殿和庙宇里担任表演艺术的导师。",
	"Like Deneir, Milil is sometimes thought of as being in service to Oghma. In these portrayals of the deity, Milil is the god's left hand, also referred to as the One True Hand. This expression isn't meant to denigrate the right hand (Deneir); rather, it stems from the fact that left-handedness is more often associated with great artistic ability and the belief that the greatest art comes from the acceptance of truth.": "与德内尔一样，米利尔有时被认为是为奥格玛服务的。在这些对神的描绘中，米利尔是神的左手，也被称为 \"唯一的真手\"。这种说法并不是要诋毁右手（Deneir）；相反，它源于这样一个事实，即左撇子更经常与伟大的艺术能力和最伟大的艺术来自于对真理的接受这一信念相关联。",
	"the lord of bones, old lord skull, the reaper": "骨头之王，骷髅老爷，收割者",
	"Myrkul is an ancient god, one of three former mortals who were raised to deityhood when Jergal grew weary of his divine duties and distributed his influence between them. Myrkul became the god of death and the dead, and ruled over the City of the Dead for centuries until he, in turn, was slain. In time Myrkul returned, for can death itself truly ever die? Myrkul's faithful see him as the Reaper, who lays claim to souls and brings them to Kelemvor to be judged.": "米尔库是一个古老的神，是三个前凡人中的一个，当杰格尔对他的神职感到厌倦并在他们之间分配他的影响时，他们被提升到神的地位。米尔库成为死亡和亡灵之神，统治亡灵之城达数百年之久，直到他反过来被杀。随着时间的推移，Myrkul回来了，因为死亡本身真的会死吗？Myrkul的信徒将他视为收割者，他对灵魂提出要求，并将它们带到Kelemvor接受审判。",
	"Myrkul is a deity of death, decay, old age, exhaustion, dusk, and autumn. He's the god of the ending of things and hopelessness, as much as Lathander is the god of beginnings and hope. Folk don't pray to Myrkul so much as dread him and blame him for aching bones and fading vision. Myrkul is thought to be passionless and uncaring even of his most devout worshipers. Those who take Myrkul as a patron tend to be morose, taciturn, and obsessed with the dead and the undead. Like many followers of Kelemvor and Jergal, priests of Myrkul serve as undertakers and typically keep their patron's identity secret.": "密尔库尔是死亡、腐烂、年老、疲惫、黄昏和秋天的神灵。他是事物结束和无望之神，就像拉坦德是开始和希望之神一样。民间并不向米尔库尔祈祷，而是害怕他，把骨头疼痛和视力减退归咎于他。Myrkul被认为是没有激情的，甚至对他最虔诚的崇拜者也毫不关心。那些把米尔库尔当做守护神的人往往情绪低落、沉默寡言，并且对死人和亡灵着迷。像许多凯勒莫和杰格尔的追随者一样，米尔库尔的祭司担任殡仪员，通常对其守护者的身份保密。",
	"Shrines to Myrkul or engravings of his holy symbol appear in many places where humans bury their dead, but full-fledged temples are rare. The few that exist are hallowed places where the dead from hundreds of miles around are brought for internment, even if they were not of Myrkul's faith. There is little space set aside for the living in such a location, usually a single modest shrine, but its catacombs and ossuaries are vast. In the deepest chamber of each temple rests a throne, and upon that throne sits the doomwarden—the preserved corpse of the most revered saint in the history of the temple (often its founder). Initiates to the faith are brought to kneel before a temple's doomwarden, where they must spend a night and a day fasting and meditating in complete darkness.": "在人类埋葬死者的许多地方都有米尔库尔的神龛或他的神圣标志的雕刻，但正式的寺庙却很少。少数存在的寺庙是神圣的地方，周围数百英里的死者被带到这里安葬，即使他们不属于Myrkul的信仰。在这样的地方，为生者预留的空间很少，通常只有一个简陋的神龛，但它的地下墓穴和骨髓库却很庞大。在每个神庙的最深处有一个宝座，宝座上坐着末日使者--神庙历史上最受尊敬的圣人（通常是其创始人）的保存的尸体。信仰的入门者会被带到寺庙的守夜人面前跪下，他们必须在完全黑暗的环境中禁食和冥想一晚和一天。",
	"the lady of mysteries, our lady of spells, the mother of all magic": "神秘的女士，我们的法术女士，所有魔法之母",
	"Mystra is the goddess of magic, and with that the goddess of possibilities. She is venerated by mages and by those who use magic or magical objects in their daily lives. She also receives the prayers of those who find magic wondrous or encounter magic they fear. Mystra is the goddess of the essential force that makes all spellcasting possible. She provides and tends the Weave, the conduit through which mortal spellcasters and magical crafters can safely access the raw force of magic.": "密斯特拉是魔法女神，同时也是可能性的女神。她受到法师和那些在日常生活中使用魔法或魔法物品的人的敬仰。她也接受那些发现魔法神奇或遇到他们害怕的魔法的人的祈祷。米斯特拉是使所有施法成为可能的基本力量的女神。她提供并管理着 \"编织\"，是凡人施法者和魔法工匠能够安全地获得原始魔法力量的渠道。",
	"The faith of Mystra is pervasive in Faerûn, which is to be expected for a land as touched by magic as it is. Her worshipers include those who use magic or work closely with it, such as alchemists and sages. The blue-clad priests of Mystran temples count wizards and sorcerers among their numbers, as well as the occasional bard. The goal of Mystra's faithful is simple: that magic be preserved and promulgated throughout the Realms. It isn't unusual for her followers to keep an eye out for those who demonstrate high potential for using magic and help arrange for such persons to find tutelage with a suitable mentor.": "Mystra的信仰在Faerûn无处不在，这对于一个被魔法触及的土地来说是可以预期的。她的崇拜者包括那些使用魔法或与之密切合作的人，如炼金术士和圣人。神秘人寺庙的蓝衣祭司中也有魔法师和巫师，以及偶尔出现的吟游诗人。米斯特拉的信徒们的目标很简单：在整个王国中保存和推广魔法。她的追随者们通常会留意那些在使用魔法方面表现出高度潜力的人，并帮助安排这些人找到合适的导师进行指导。",
	"the binder, the lord of knowledge": "知识的主宰--装订者",
	"Oghma is the god of inspiration, invention, and knowledge. Above all else, Oghma represents knowledge in its most supreme, raw form—the idea. An aphorism cited by his faithful about this concept serves them as a prayer when it is repeated aloud: \"An idea has no heft but it can move mountains. An idea has no authority but it can dominate people. An idea has no strength but it can push aside empires. Knowledge is the greatest tool of the mortal mind, outweighing anything made by mortal hands. Before anything else can exist, the idea must exist.\"": "Oghma是灵感、发明和知识之神。最重要的是，奥格玛代表着知识的最高、最原始的形式--理念。他的信徒们引用的关于这个概念的箴言，当它被大声重复的时候，可以作为他们的祈祷词。\"一个想法没有重量，但它可以移动山脉。一个想法没有权威，但它可以主宰人。一个想法没有力量，但它可以推开帝国。知识是凡人头脑中最伟大的工具，胜过凡人手中的任何东西。在其他任何东西能够存在之前，思想必须存在\"。",
	"Oghma's faithful spread knowledge and literacy as widely as possible, believing that minds ought never to be shackled by ignorance and thus not be able to bequeath the benefit they might otherwise provide their fellows. Not surprisingly, those who follow Oghma oppose those who foster deceit, trickery, and ignorance.": "Oghma的信徒尽可能广泛地传播知识和文化，他们认为思想不应该被无知所束缚，从而不能留下他们可能提供给同伴的好处。毫不奇怪，那些追随Oghma的人反对那些助长欺骗、诡计和无知的人。",
	"Folk of many professions favor the Binder: wizards, cartographers, artists, bards, clerks, inventors, sages, scribes, and all manner of others who uncover, preserve, and create knowledge and learning. The worship of Oghma was, at one point, one of the few organized faiths in Faerûn that had an established orthodoxy and a complete network of temples that adhered to that orthodoxy. Schisms during the Time of Troubles shattered that network, and now the structures that house the faith are individual temples or small networks of allied temples, much in the manner of other faiths.": "许多职业的人都喜欢装订者：巫师、制图师、艺术家、吟游诗人、文员、发明家、圣人、抄写员，以及其他各种发掘、保存和创造知识和学问的人。对奥格玛的崇拜一度是法鲁恩为数不多的有组织的信仰之一，它有一个既定的正统观念和一个完整的寺庙网络，坚持该正统观念。动乱时期的分裂打破了这一网络，现在容纳该信仰的结构是单独的寺庙或小型的联盟寺庙网络，与其他信仰的方式很相似。",
	"the lady of strategy, the crimson general, the grandmaster of the lanceboard": "战略女士，深红将军，长枪短炮的祖师爷",
	"The Red Knight is the goddess of planning and strategy. Those who favor her call themselves the Red Fellowship. They believe wars are won by the best planning, strategy, and tactics. The worship of the Red Knight is filled with doctrine about strategy, such as: \"Every war is a series of battles. Losing one doesn't mean losing the war.\" \"In war, plan for peace. In peace, plan for war.\" \"Seek allies among your enemy's enemies.\"": "红骑士是计划和战略的女神。那些拥护她的人称自己为红色团契。他们相信战争是由最好的计划、战略和战术赢得的。对红骑士的崇拜充满了关于战略的学说，例如。\"每场战争都是一系列的战斗。输掉一场并不意味着输掉这场战争\"。\"在战争中，为和平做打算。在和平中，要为战争做打算。\" \"在敌人的敌人中寻找盟友\"。",
	"Worship of the Red Knight arose among a hero-venerating monastic order of Tempus in Tethyr shortly after the Time of Troubles. The Red Knight has since grown in popularity because of what her followers call the Great Stratagem: for decades, her priests have been traveling to places of warfare to educate generals and kings in the arts of strategy and battlefield tactics. Many of the leaders they approached turned them away at first, but it soon became apparent that those who accepted the counsel of the Crimson General's followers gained a distinct benefit. Grateful victors built temples to the Lady of Strategy, and gradually her faith spread.": "乱世之后不久，在泰特希尔的一个崇拜英雄的修道会中出现了对红骑士的崇拜。由于她的追随者称之为 \"伟大的计谋\"，红衣骑士从此变得越来越受欢迎：几十年来，她的牧师们一直前往战争之地，向将军和国王们传授战略和战场战术的艺术。起初，他们接触的许多领导人都拒绝了他们，但很快就发现，那些接受深红将军的追随者的建议的人获得了明显的好处。感激的胜利者们为战略女神建造了寺庙，她的信仰也逐渐传播开来。",
	"Today, followers of the Red Knight can be found in nearly any land that has seen warfare in the past century. Worshipers of the Red Knight are rare in the general population, but those who revere her can frequently be found among high-ranking commanders of armies, instructors in colleges of war, quartermasters, and the authors of tomes of strategy. Each temple to the Red Knight includes an altar dedicated to Tempus, and so such a place is likely to be frequented by mercenaries and soldiers. A temple is surrounded by a vast pavilion and courtyard, which can be rented by companies of soldiers and mercenaries for practice and training. Her priests believe that drilling one's troops in a temple courtyard is a form of propitiation that the Red Knight looks upon with special favor.": "今天，几乎所有在过去一个世纪里发生过战争的土地上都能找到红骑士的追随者。红骑士的崇拜者在普通人中很少见，但在军队的高级指挥官、战争学院的教官、军需官和战略书的作者中，经常可以看到崇敬她的人。每座红衣骑士的神庙都有一个供奉坦帕斯的祭坛，因此这样的地方很可能是雇佣兵和士兵经常光顾的地方。寺庙周围有一个巨大的亭子和院子，士兵和佣兵公司可以租用这些地方进行练习和训练。她的牧师们认为，在神庙的院子里操练军队是一种祭祀的形式，红衣骑士对其特别青睐。",
	"the all-seeing, the third eye, divination's lord": "第三只眼，占卜的主宰者",
	"Savras is a god of divination and fortunetelling. Few people worship him, but many pray to him when performing small rituals of foresight. For example, young men and women sometimes attempt to divine the names of their future spouses by saying a rhyming chant that calls upon Savras while gazing in a mirror.": "萨弗拉是一个占卜和算命的神。很少有人崇拜他，但许多人在举行预知的小仪式时向他祈祷。例如，年轻男子和妇女有时会在照镜子时，通过念念有词的咒语，呼唤萨瓦拉，试图占卜他们未来配偶的名字。",
	"Savras has no currently active temples in Faerûn, and his shrines are few and far between, tucked away in the corners of libraries and scriptoria. Despite this lack of prominence, certain folk pay regular homage to Savras, including investigators, diviners, judges, and others who have a need to uncover the truth. Such individuals can sometimes be identified by the elaborate staffs they carry in homage to Savras. According to legend, Savras was trapped in Azuth's staff for ages. Azuth eventually freed Savras so long as Savras swore fealty, and today the staff is a potent symbol for those who revere Savras. Devout worshipers take great pains to decorate and embellish their staffs, each hoping that Savras might find it a welcoming place to stop for a time.": "萨弗拉斯目前在法鲁恩没有活跃的寺庙，他的神龛也很少，都藏在图书馆和剧本馆的角落里。尽管他的地位并不显赫，但某些人还是经常向萨弗拉斯致敬，包括调查员、占卜师、法官和其他需要揭开真相的人。这些人有时可以通过他们携带的向萨弗拉斯致敬的精致法杖来识别。根据传说，萨弗拉被困于阿祖斯的法杖中已久。只要萨乌斯宣誓效忠，阿祖斯最终释放了萨乌斯，如今这根法杖是那些敬仰萨乌斯的人的有力象征。虔诚的崇拜者不遗余力地装饰和修饰他们的法杖，每个人都希望萨弗拉斯能发现它是一个受欢迎的地方，可以停留一段时间。",
	"our lady of silver, the moonmaiden, the night white lady": "我们的银发女郎，月亮女郎，夜白女郎",
	"Selûne is thought to be among the most ancient of Faerûn's deities. Most humans in Faerûn consider the moon in the sky to literally be the goddess gazing down on the world, and the trailing motes of light behind it her tears. She is also a goddess of stars and navigation as well as motherhood and reproductive cycles. She is seen as a calm power, frequently venerated by female humans as well as by a mix of other folk: navigators and sailors, those who work honestly at night, those seeking protection in the dark, the lost, and the questing.": "塞鲁尼被认为是法鲁恩最古老的神灵之一。法鲁恩的大多数人类认为天空中的月亮就是女神在凝视着这个世界，而月亮后面的拖曳光斑就是她的眼泪。她也是星星和导航以及母性和生殖周期的女神。她被视为一种平静的力量，经常被女性人类以及其他民间混合体所敬仰：航海家和水手，那些在夜间诚实工作的人，那些在黑暗中寻求保护的人，迷路的人，以及探索的人。",
	"There are many legends about Selûne, chief among them being the tale of the battle at the beginning of time between Selûne and her sister, Shar. The Tears of Selûne, the cluster of starry lights that follow the moon around the sky, are thought to be brought about by the goddess's joy, sorrow, or both.": "有许多关于塞卢恩的传说，其中最主要的是塞卢恩和她的妹妹沙尔在时间之初的战斗故事。塞卢恩的眼泪，是跟随月亮在天空中出现的一簇星光，被认为是由女神的快乐、悲伤或两者同时带来的。",
	"Milk, a symbol of motherhood, is used in many rites performed by the worshipers of Selûne, as are trances and meditation. Those who favor her typically set a bowl of milk outside on each night of the full moon.": "牛奶是母性的象征，在塞鲁尼的崇拜者举行的许多仪式中，都会用到牛奶，就像安眠和冥想一样。赞成她的人通常在每个月圆之夜在外面放一碗牛奶。",
	"the mistress of the night, the dark lady, our lady of loss": "夜晚的女主人，黑暗的女士，我们的损失的女士",
	"The dark twin of Selûne, Shar is the goddess of darkness, both in its physical form and as it exists in the minds and souls of mortals. People worship Shar as the goddess of night, secrets, loss, and forgetfulness. She represents pains hidden but not forgotten, and vengeances carefully nurtured away from the light. She is said to have the power to make folk forget their pain or become inured to a loss, and many people in distress pray to Shar for such a blessing.": "沙尔是塞鲁恩的黑暗双胞胎，是黑暗的女神，无论是物理形式还是存在于凡人的思想和灵魂中。人们把夏尔当作黑夜、秘密、损失和遗忘的女神来崇拜。她代表着隐藏但不被遗忘的痛苦，以及远离光明而精心培育的复仇。据说她有能力让人们忘记他们的痛苦，或对损失变得麻木不仁，许多处于困境的人向夏尔祈求这种祝福。",
	"Shar is revered by those who must venture into dark places and so pray to her for protection, such as miners, as well as by those who have fallen into melancholy and despair, who wish to forget something, or who have lost something and wish to recover it. Priests drawn to serve Shar often nurture their own deep wounds or dark secrets, which in their minds makes them best suited to console those who suffer from a similar ill. Throughout the world's history, many followers of Shar have done dark deeds in her name—most notably the shadovar of Netheril, an entire society dedicated to Shar. The tragedies and losses brought about by the fanaticism of her followers have caused many places to outlaw her worship and thus driven most of her priests into secrecy, but such prohibitions only heighten the priests' umbrage at authorities and make the faithful a focal point for rebellion and revenge against whoever rules.": "Shar受到那些必须冒险进入黑暗之地并因此向她祈求保护的人的敬重，例如矿工，以及那些陷入忧郁和绝望的人，他们希望忘记一些东西，或者失去一些东西并希望找回它。被吸引来为夏尔服务的牧师往往养育着他们自己的深层伤口或黑暗的秘密，在他们心中，这使他们最适合安慰那些遭受类似疾病的人。在整个世界的历史中，许多夏尔的追随者以她的名义做了一些黑暗的事情--最引人注目的是尼瑟尔的沙多瓦，一个致力于夏尔的整个社会。她的追随者的狂热所带来的悲剧和损失导致许多地方禁止对她的崇拜，从而使她的大多数祭司陷入隐秘之中，但这种禁令只会加剧祭司们对当局的不满，使信徒们成为叛乱和报复谁的焦点。",
	"oak father, the old oak, old father tree": "橡树父亲，老橡树，老父亲树",
	"Silvanus represents the entirety of nature, deserts as well as forests, sharks as much as deer. But folk in the North, who contend with the dangers of forests, mountains, and plains, see Silvanus more as a god of those places. Silvanus is thought of as a grim and severe father figure who metes out flood and drought, fire and ice, and life and death in the wilderness. In legends he often commands other nature deities, dealing out rewards and punishments to them as is fitting.": "希尔瓦娜斯代表整个自然界，沙漠和森林，鲨鱼和鹿一样多。但在北方，与森林、山脉和平原的危险抗争的人们，更多地将希尔瓦娜斯视为这些地方的神。希尔瓦娜斯被认为是一个严酷的父亲形象，他在荒野中施展洪水和干旱、火焰和冰块、生命和死亡。在传说中，他经常指挥其他自然神灵，对他们进行适当的奖励和惩罚。",
	"Nature and its impartial fairness is central to the dogma of Silvanus's faith. His priests seek to know the total situation, to view the macrocosm; their viewpoint isn't confined to one person's or one nation's idea of what is best. The loss of a farming community to goblin raids is a tragedy for some, but the event provides an opportunity for the wilderness to grow up and make the land fertile again, which in turn provides new challenges for those who would return to tame it.": "自然及其公正的公平性是希尔瓦娜斯信仰教条的核心。他的牧师们寻求了解整体情况，观察宏观世界；他们的观点并不局限于一个人或一个国家对什么是最好的想法。一个农业社区因地精的袭击而消失，对一些人来说是个悲剧，但这一事件为荒野提供了一个机会，使土地重新变得肥沃，这反过来又为那些将返回驯服土地的人提供了新的挑战。",
	"The creed of Silvanus dictates that nature's glory must be preserved not merely because nature is beautiful, but because wild nature is the true state of the world. Its expanses refresh and revitalize the mortal soul, and give breath to all the world. Many of his faithful oppose the expansion of settlements into wild places, and consider excessive consumption of natural resources to be not only wasteful but blasphemous.": "西尔瓦努斯的信条规定，自然界的光辉必须得到保护，不仅仅是因为自然界是美丽的，还因为野生自然界是世界的真实状态。它的广袤让凡人的灵魂焕发活力，并给所有的世界带来气息。他的许多信徒反对将定居点扩展到野外，并认为对自然资源的过度消耗不仅是浪费，而且是亵渎。",
	"Silvanus often receives veneration from travelers in wild lands, explorers, and residents of rural communities far from the protection of a local lord or a great city. The oak leaf is Silvanus's symbol, and a grove of oak trees within a village or on its outskirts is often dedicated as a shrine to him. In rural places where oak trees don't grow, an oak leaf etched into the bark of another kind of tree signifies a sacred site.": "希尔瓦娜斯经常受到野地旅行者、探险家和远离当地领主或大城市保护的农村社区居民的敬仰。橡树叶是希尔瓦娜斯的象征，村子里或郊区的橡树林常常被作为圣地献给他。在不生长橡树的农村地区，将橡树叶刻在另一种树的树皮上，象征着一个圣地。",
	"lady firehair, the lady of love, the princess of passion": "火毛女士，爱的女士，激情的公主",
	"Sune Firehair is a deity of passion and the delights of the senses. She is the goddess of beauty in all its forms—not just pleasing sights, but also enchanting sounds, luxurious tastes and scents, and the exquisite pleasures of the flesh, from a lover's caress to the brush of silk on the skin. Her worshipers seek out these pleasures in life, not out of mere decadence, but because the experience of pleasure is the touch of Sune herself.": "苏妮-弗海尔是一位激情和感官享受的神灵。她是各种形式的美的女神--不仅仅是令人愉悦的景象，还有迷人的声音、奢华的味道和气味，以及肉体的精致快乐，从情人的爱抚到皮肤上的丝绸刷。她的崇拜者在生活中寻求这些快乐，不是出于单纯的颓废，而是因为快乐的体验就是苏妮本人的触摸。",
	"The followers of Sune have a reputation as hedonists, and so they are, to a degree. More than that, her priests foster beauty in the world. They do so by creating art, by acting as patrons for promising talents, and by investing in merchants who bring luxuries to far-off places that have never seen satin or tasted a luscious wine.": "苏妮的追随者有享乐主义的名声，在某种程度上，他们也是如此。不仅如此，她的祭司们还在世界范围内培养美。他们通过创造艺术，作为有前途的人才的赞助人，以及投资于将奢侈品带到从未见过绸缎或品尝过美味葡萄酒的遥远地方的商人，来做到这一点。",
	"Her priests consider loveliness to be one of their greatest callings, and all are trained in comportment, fashion, and cosmetics. Indeed, so talented are Sune's priests in the creation of beautiful appearances that many take pride in their ability to present themselves as stunningly attractive examples of either gender.": "她的牧师们认为美丽是他们最大的使命之一，所有的人都接受过礼仪、时尚和化妆品方面的培训。事实上，苏妮的牧师们在创造美丽的外表方面是如此有天赋，以至于许多人都为自己能够作为两性中令人惊叹的例子而感到自豪。",
	"But beauty is more than skin deep, say the Sunites; it issues from the core of one's being and shows one's true face to the world, whether fair or foul. The followers of Sune are believers in romance, true love winning over all, and following one's heart to one's true destination. Fated matches, impossible loves, and ugly ducklings becoming swans are all in the purview of Sune.": "但是，苏尼人说，美不仅仅是皮肤上的，它来自一个人的核心，向世界展示一个人的真实面目，无论是公平的还是肮脏的。苏妮的追随者相信浪漫，相信真爱能战胜一切，相信跟随自己的心去寻找真正的目的地。命中注定的比赛，不可能的爱情，以及丑小鸭变成天鹅，都在苏妮的职权范围内。",
	"Temples dedicated to Sune are common in human lands, and they frequently serve as public baths and places of relaxation. A temple usually features a mirrored and well-lit salon where folks can primp, as well as see others and be seen. Where a temple doesn't exist, or in a large city where the nearest temple might be too far to walk to, a small shrine to Sune often stands near a street corner. These sites consist of a mirror hung beneath a small roof where one can say a prayer while checking one's appearance. The spot might feature a shelf or a cupboard holding various perfumes and cosmetics so that those without the funds to purchase such items can still make themselves feel beautiful.": "献给苏妮的寺庙在人类的土地上很常见，它们经常作为公共浴室和放松的地方。寺庙通常有一个有镜子的、光线充足的沙龙，人们可以在那里梳妆打扮，也可以看到别人，被别人看到。在没有寺庙的地方，或者在大城市里，最近的寺庙可能太远，无法步行前往，苏妮的小神龛往往矗立在街角附近。这些场所由悬挂在小屋顶下的镜子组成，人们可以在那里一边祈祷一边检查自己的外表。这个地方可能有一个架子或一个柜子，里面放着各种香水和化妆品，以便那些没有资金购买这些物品的人仍然可以让自己感到美丽。",

Depicted in temple iconography as a withered crone with a cup or a vase that holds all the varieties of disease and poison, Talona is a fearsome goddess, and many are the prayers that beg her for protection from illness and poison. Various rituals to placate her involve the use of three drops of blood or three tears—to be dropped into a well that has gone bad, dripped into the handkerchief of someone beset by coughing, dropped into a fire made by burning a withered crop, dripped into the mouth of a plague sufferer, and so on. It's common practice to mark a container of poison with her holy symbol, three droplets in a triangle, and during epidemics folk paint the same image on the homes of the infected.": "塔罗娜是法鲁恩最常祈求的神灵之一，她是疾病和毒药的女神，从普通疾病到庄稼歉收，再到咸水井和瘟疫，她都要负责。塔罗娜在神庙中被描绘成一个枯萎的老妪，手里拿着一个杯子或花瓶，里面装着各种疾病和毒药，塔罗娜是一个可怕的女神，很多人都在祈祷，希望她能保护自己免受疾病和毒药的伤害。安抚她的各种仪式包括使用三滴血或三滴眼泪--滴入变坏的井中，滴入被咳嗽困扰的人的手帕中，滴入燃烧枯萎作物的火中，滴入瘟疫患者的口中，等等。通常的做法是在装毒药的容器上标上她的神圣符号，即三角形中的三个水滴，而在流行病期间，民间也会在感染者的家里画上同样的图案。",
	"Though she is often the recipient of prayers, Talona has almost no temples and few cults dedicated to her. A cult or a shrine to her might arise in an area after it suffers from pestilence, when some of those who survived decide to revere her or even become priests.": "虽然她经常接受祈祷，但塔罗娜几乎没有寺庙，也很少有崇拜她的人。在一个地区遭受瘟疫后，当一些幸存的人决定敬仰她甚至成为祭司时，可能会出现对她的崇拜或神龛。",
	"stormlord, the destroyer": "毁灭者风暴领主",
	"Talos is the dark side of nature, the uncaring and destructive force that might strike at any time. He is the god of storms, forest fires, earthquakes, tornadoes, and general destruction. He counts the ravager, the raider, the looter, and the brigand among his followers. Those who favor him see life as a succession of random effects in a sea of chaos, so the devout should grab what they can, when they can—for who can say when Talos will strike and send them into the afterlife?": "塔洛斯是自然界的黑暗面，是无情的破坏性力量，随时都可能发作。他是风暴、森林火灾、地震、龙卷风和一般破坏之神。他的追随者中包括掠夺者、袭击者、掠夺者和强盗。那些支持他的人把生命看作是混乱之海中的一连串随机效应，所以虔诚的人应该在他们能做到的时候抓住他们能做到的，因为谁能说塔洛斯什么时候会袭击他们并把他们送进来世呢？",
	"Talos is portrayed as a broad-shouldered, bearded young man with a single good eye, the other covered by a dark patch. He is said to carry a collection of three staffs, made from the first tree cut down in the world, the first silver smelted, and the first iron forged. He uses these staffs to raise destructive winds, cause terrible storms, and split the land in acts of rage. The three lightning bolts of his holy symbol represent these staffs, and when he vents his wrath on the world, he is thought to hurl them down from the sky as lightning strikes.": "塔洛斯被描绘成一个宽肩的、有胡子的年轻人，只有一只好眼睛，另一只眼睛被一个黑斑覆盖。据说他手持三根法杖，这三根法杖是由世界上第一棵被砍伐的树、第一块被冶炼的银和第一块被锻造的铁制成的。他用这些法杖刮起破坏性的风，引起可怕的风暴，并在愤怒中分裂土地。他的神圣标志中的三道闪电代表这些法杖，当他向世界发泄愤怒时，人们认为他将这些法杖作为闪电从天上扔下来。",
	"Although Talos is a popular deity, his name is invoked more often out of fear than out of reverence. He does have priests, mostly traveling doomsayers, who warn of disasters to come and accept charity in exchange for blessings of protection. Many of his faithful wear a black eyepatch, even if both eyes are intact.": "虽然塔洛斯是一个受欢迎的神灵，但他的名字更多的是出于恐惧而不是崇敬而被引用。他确实有祭司，大多是旅行中的预言家，他们警告即将到来的灾难，并接受慈善以换取保护的祝福。他的许多信徒都戴着黑色的眼罩，即使两只眼睛都是完整的。",
	"the foehammer, the lord of battles": "战斗的主宰--佛哈默",
	"Tempus is a war god concerned with brave conduct during war, using force of arms over talk for settling disputes, and encouraging bloodshed. The god of war is random in his favors, meaning that his chaotic nature favors all sides equally. Lord Tempus might be an army's ally one day, and its enemy the next. He might seem to manifest before a battle, appearing to one side or the other. If he is seen riding a white mare (Veiros), then the army will succeed. If he rides a black stallion (Deiros), then defeat is certain. Most often he appears to be riding with one foot in each mount's stirrup, signifying the unpredictable nature of battle. In such visions, Tempus is always a powerfully built warrior dressed for battle in the style of those who envision him.": "坦帕斯是一位战神，关注战争期间的勇敢行为，使用武力而不是谈话来解决争端，并鼓励流血。战争之神的宠爱是随机的，这意味着他的混乱本性对所有各方的宠爱是平等的。坦普斯勋爵可能在某一天成为一支军队的盟友，而第二天又成为其敌人。他可能会在战斗前显灵，出现在一方或另一方。如果他被看到骑着一匹白色的母马（Veiros），那么军队就会成功。如果他骑着一匹黑色的骏马（Deiros），那么失败是肯定的。最常见的情况是，他在骑马时，每匹坐骑都有一只脚踩在马镫上，表示战斗的不可预测性。在这样的幻象中，坦普斯总是一个身强力壮的战士，按照设想他的人的风格为战斗而打扮。",
	"Tempus's favor might be randomly distributed, but over the centuries his priests have made an effort to spread and enforce a common code of warfare—to make war a thing of rules, respect for reputations, and professional behavior. This code, called Tempus's Honor, has the purpose of making conflicts brief, decisive, and as safe as possible for those not directly involved. The rules in the code include the following: arm anyone who has need of a weapon; disparage no foe; acquit oneself with bravery; train all for battle; and don't engage in feuds. Those who poison wells, taint fields, kill noncombatants, or engage in torture in the name of war are all considered sinners.": "Tempus的宠爱可能是随机分配的，但几个世纪以来，他的牧师们努力传播和执行共同的战争准则--使战争成为一种规则、对声誉的尊重和专业行为。这套被称为 \"坦普斯的荣誉 \"的守则，其目的是使冲突简短、果断，并且对那些没有直接参与的人来说尽可能安全。守则中的规则包括以下内容：武装任何需要武器的人；不贬低任何敌人；勇敢地证明自己；为战斗训练所有人；不参与争斗。那些在井中投毒、玷污田地、杀害非战斗人员或以战争的名义从事酷刑的人都被视为罪人。",
	"Worshipers of Tempus are legion, and his name is often on the lips of soldiers. His priests are tacticians, often skilled in the art of war. Many of his ordained don't serve in temples, but as battlefield chaplains with armies and mercenary companies, encouraging their fellow soldiers with both word and blade. Priests of Tempus teach that war conducted properly is fair in that it oppresses all sides equally, and that in any given battle, a mortal might be slain or might become a great leader among his or her companions. Mortals shouldn't fear war but should see it as a natural force, the storm that civilization brings about by its very existence.": "崇拜坦普斯的人很多，他的名字经常出现在士兵的口中。他的祭司是战术家，通常精通战争艺术。他的许多受戒者不在寺庙中服务，而是作为军队和雇佣兵公司的战场牧师，用语言和刀剑鼓励他们的士兵。坦普斯的祭司们教导说，正确进行的战争是公平的，因为它平等地压迫所有各方，而且在任何特定的战斗中，一个凡人可能被杀，也可能成为他或她的同伴中的伟大领袖。凡人不应该害怕战争，而应该把它看作是一种自然力量，是文明的存在所带来的风暴。",
	"the loyal fury, the true, the hand of righteousness": "忠诚的怒火，真实的，正义的手",
	"Torm is the god of duty and loyalty, revered by those who face danger to bring about a greater good. Those who favor Torm believe that one's salvation can be found through service, that every failure to perform one's duty diminishes Torm, and that every success adds to his luster. Those who take Torm to heart must strive to fulfill his commandment to go out into the world and be an active force for good, to right wrongs, and to help the hopeless. They must strive to maintain peace and order while opposing unjust laws. Followers of Torm stand ever alert against corruption and are expected to strike quickly and hard against any evidence of rot in the hearts of mortals. As the sword arm of justice, Torm's faithful are expected to bring quick deaths to betrayers. Considering these tenets, it should be no surprise that most human paladins have Torm as their patron.": "托尔姆是责任和忠诚之神，受到那些为实现更大利益而面临危险的人的敬重。赞成托尔姆的人相信，一个人的救赎可以通过服务找到，每一次失败都会削弱托尔姆，而每一次成功都会增加他的光辉。那些把托尔姆放在心上的人必须努力履行他的戒律，走向世界，成为一支积极的正义力量，纠正错误，帮助无望的人。他们必须努力维护和平与秩序，同时反对不公正的法律。托尔姆的追随者对腐败保持警惕，并被期望迅速而严厉地打击凡人心中的任何腐败证据。作为正义的剑臂，托尔姆的信徒被期望对背叛者进行快速的死亡。考虑到这些信条，大多数人类圣骑士将托尔姆作为他们的守护者就不足为奇了。",
	"Most temples dedicated to Torm are fortresses built on heights. These structures offer austere quarters for residents and visiting knights, drilling grounds, and stables. White granite, lion statues, and armored figures predominate in the architecture, with the coats of arms of fallen heroes decorating the walls of the great halls.": "大多数供奉托尔姆的寺庙都是建在高处的堡垒。这些建筑为居民和来访的骑士提供了简朴的住所、训练场和马厩。白色花岗岩、狮子雕像和盔甲人物在建筑中占主导地位，大殿的墙壁上还装饰着阵亡英雄的纹章。",
	"Torm is seen as the good right hand of Tyr, and a such his symbol is a white gauntlet made for the right hand. It represents Tyr's sword hand, but it is also a symbol of forbearance. Torm is frequently depicted with his right gauntlet extended palm forward, which worshipers call the Hand Resolute. It signifies the principle that the just and true must pause before acting to judge whether their intentions uphold Torm's ideals. Temples, civic structures, and the homes of the faithful are often decorated with images of the Hand Resolute as a constant reminder of this principle.": "托尔姆被看作是泰尔的好右手，因此他的象征是为右手制作的白色铠甲。它代表泰尔的剑手，但也是宽容的象征。托尔姆经常被描绘成右臂向前伸出的手掌，崇拜者称之为 \"坚定之手\"。它象征着这样一个原则：公正和真实的人在行动之前必须暂停，以判断他们的意图是否符合托尔姆的理想。寺庙、市政建筑和信徒的家中经常装饰着坚决之手的图像，以不断提醒人们注意这一原则。",
	"Worshipers of Torm come from most walks of life, for he welcomes any who seek the best in themselves and others, who uphold his tenets of loyalty, responsibility, duty, and kindness, or who are willing to sacrifice to keep evil from gaining ascendancy in the world. The faithful know that all of them will stumble from time to time while following in Torm's footsteps, but Torm's priests teach that the shame of a minor fall from grace is far less severe than declining to rise oneself up to Torm's standards.": "托尔姆的崇拜者来自各行各业，因为他欢迎任何在自己和他人身上寻求最好的人，维护他的忠诚、责任、义务和仁慈的信条，或者愿意为阻止邪恶在世界中占据优势而做出牺牲。信徒们知道，在追随托尔姆的脚步时，他们所有人都会时不时地跌倒，但托尔姆的牧师们教导说，轻微失足的耻辱远没有拒绝将自己提升到托尔姆的标准那么严重。",
	"lady luck, our smiling lady": "幸运女神，我们的笑脸",
	"Tymora is the bright-faced goddess of fortune, the one to whom gamblers and game-players pray in Faerûn. Our Smiling Lady is said to love none so much as those who gamble with the utmost skill and daring. Yet she is thought to watch over all who take risks to better their fortunes.": "泰莫拉是面容清秀的幸运女神，是法鲁恩的赌徒和游戏者所祈祷的对象。我们的微笑女神据说最爱的是那些以最大的技巧和胆量进行赌博的人。然而，人们认为她会照看所有为改善自己命运而冒险的人。",
	"The battle cry of the followers of Tymora is \"Fortune favors the bold.\" Someone might say words to Tymora before any endeavor in which a little good luck would help, but not when an incidence of bad luck might occur. (On such occasions folk pray to Beshaba to spare them from bad luck; praying to both is thought to anger both goddesses.) One common method of divining the future is to toss a coin to a stranger (typically a beggar) and ask if it's heads. If it is, the coin is left with the stranger as payment for Tymora's favor. If it's not, the stranger can choose to keep it (and the bad luck) or return it.": "泰莫拉的追随者的战斗口号是 \"命运眷顾大胆者\"。有人可能会在任何努力之前对泰莫拉说些话，因为在这些努力中，一点好运气会有所帮助，但在可能发生坏运气的时候则不会。(在这种情况下，人们会向贝沙巴祈祷，让他们免于厄运；向两位女神祈祷被认为会激怒两位女神）。一种常见的占卜方法是向陌生人（通常是乞丐）抛出一枚硬币，问其是否是正面。如果是，就把硬币留给陌生人，作为对泰莫拉的回报。如果不是，陌生人可以选择保留它（和坏运气）或归还它。",
	"Those who favor Tymora—as distinct from folk who invoke her name by mumbling over the dice—tend to be daring sorts. Adventurers and gamblers make up much of their ranks. They all have the belief that what is good about their lives is the result of having both good luck and the bravery to seek it out. Tymora has worshipers among all sorts of folk: the dashing young noble, the risk-taking merchant, the daydreaming field hand, and the scheming ne'er-do-well.": "那些喜欢泰莫拉的人--与那些通过对着骰子喃喃自语来呼唤她的名字的人不同--往往都是大胆的人。冒险家和赌徒占了他们队伍的大部分。他们都相信，他们生活中的美好事物都是拥有好运气和勇于寻找的结果。泰莫拉在各种人群中都有崇拜者：潇洒的年轻贵族、敢于冒险的商人、做白日梦的农夫，以及诡计多端的新手。",
	"Priests of Tymora and temples devoted to Lady Luck are scarce, since her faith tends not to stress a need for intermediaries: \"Let the lucky man and the Smiling Lady suss it out,\" as the old saying goes. Shrines to Tymora at gambling parlors aren't unusual, however, and sometimes such establishments attract a priest and effectively become temples.": "泰莫拉的牧师和致力于幸运女神的寺庙很少，因为她的信仰往往不强调对中介的需求。俗话说：\"让幸运的人和微笑的女士来解决这个问题\"。然而，在赌博场所中供奉泰莫拉的神龛并不罕见，有时这种场所会吸引一名牧师，并有效地成为寺庙。",
	"Before the Dawn Cataclysm, there was but one goddess of luck, Tyche. Ever flirting with fortune and disaster, Lady Luck bestowed and withdrew her favor at a whim. When her current paramour, Lathander, started a fight among the gods, Tyche kissed the Morninglord with misfortune and wandered off to explore the world.": "在黎明大灾变之前，只有一位幸运女神，泰切。幸运女神总是与财富和灾难调情，她随心所欲地赐予和收回她的恩惠。当她现在的姘头拉坦德（Lathander）在众神之间挑起争斗时，泰切以不幸的方式亲吻了晨曦之神，并漫步去探索世界。",
	"During her travels, Lady Luck discovered a budding rose of unequaled beauty. Delighted with this fortuitous happenstance, Tyche reached to pluck this delightful token, which she assumed was a peace overture from Lathander, who sought to regain her good graces. Much to her amazement, Lady Luck couldn't pluck the rose from its bush no matter how hard she tried. Frustrated, she cursed the rose with bad luck, and the flower's stem broke in her hands. Tyche put the plucked rose behind her ear and continued on her way. Unknown to Tyche, the rose was a manifestation of Moander, god of corruption and decay. The severed rose stem crept into Tyche's ear and subtly began to rot her from the inside out.": "在她的旅行中，幸运女神发现了一朵美丽无比的含苞待放的玫瑰。泰切对这一偶然事件感到高兴，伸手摘下了这朵令人愉快的信物，她认为这是拉坦德的和平姿态，他想重新获得她的好感。令她惊讶的是，无论她如何努力，幸运女神都无法将这朵玫瑰从花丛中摘下。沮丧之余，她诅咒这朵玫瑰不吉利，花茎在她手中折断。泰切把摘下的玫瑰放在耳后，继续走她的路。泰切不知道，这朵玫瑰是腐败和衰败之神莫安德的化身。被折断的玫瑰花茎悄悄地进入了泰切的耳朵，并巧妙地开始从里到外腐蚀她。",
	"When Tyche returned home, she came across her dear friend, the goddess Selûne, waiting to speak with her. Also waiting for her were Lathander, who wished to regain her affections, and Azuth, who had come to mediate the dispute between the two. Selûne wept great tears as she saw the corruption destroying her friend from within, and before Tyche could discern her intent, Selûne lashed out with a bolt of purifying light. Tyche's rotted core split down the middle and a smaller, brighter version of the goddess of luck stepped out, allowing the goddess of the moon to save that which was good and pure in her friend. However, following this first figure out of the rotten shell was another form stunning to behold, but full of dark malice and capricious ill will. As the two forms emerged, they immediately fell upon each other in hate, struggling madly, and were separated only by the combined efforts of all three visitors.": "当泰切回到家时，她遇到了她的挚友塞鲁恩女神，她在等着和她说话。等待她的还有希望重新获得她的感情的拉坦德，以及前来调解两人之间争端的阿苏特。当塞卢恩看到她的朋友被腐败从内部摧毁时，她流下了巨大的泪水，在泰切能够看出她的意图之前，塞卢恩用一道净化的光束打了出去。泰切腐烂的核心从中间裂开，一个更小、更明亮的幸运女神走了出来，让月亮女神拯救了她朋友身上的善与纯。然而，紧随这第一个人物走出腐烂的外壳的是另一个令人惊叹的形式，但充满了黑暗的恶意和反复无常的恶意。当这两个形体出现时，它们立即互相仇视，疯狂地挣扎着，只有在所有三个来访者的共同努力下才得以分开。",
	"It is said that Tymora, Tyche's Fair-Haired Daughter, embodies all the grace and kindness of her mother, while Beshaba, Tyche's Unpleasant Daughter, got only her looks. Since their birth, the twin aspects of Tyche—Tymora, Lady Luck, and Beshaba, Maid of Misfortune—have battled each other, contesting matters as great as the fate of nations and as small as the flip of a coin.": "据说泰莫拉，泰切的白发女儿，体现了她母亲所有的优雅和善良，而贝沙巴，泰切的不愉快的女儿，只得到了她的外表。自出生以来，泰切的双胞胎--幸运女神泰莫拉和不幸少女贝沙巴--一直在相互争斗，争夺大到国家命运，小到一枚硬币的翻转的问题。",
	"grimjaws, the maimed god, the evenhanded": "残缺的神灵，平凡的人",
	"Tyr Grimjaws, Tyr the Evenhanded, Wounded Tyr, the Maimed God, the Blind, Blind Tyr, the Lord of Justice—all of these names speak to the nature of the Faerûnian god of justice. Tyr appears as a noble warrior missing his right hand, which he lost to Kezef the Chaos Hound in an act of bravery and sacrifice, and with his eyes wrapped in cloth to signify his blindness, caused by a wound dealt to him by Ao when he questioned the justice of the Overgod's actions.": "Tyr Grimjaws, Tyr the Evenhanded, Wounded Tyr, the Maimed God, the Blind, Blind Tyr, the Lord of Just-all of these names speak to the nature of the Faerûnian god of justice. 泰尔作为一个高贵的战士出现，他的右手在一次勇敢和牺牲的行动中被混沌猎犬凯泽夫夺走，他的眼睛被布包裹着，象征着他的失明，这是因为他质疑超神行动的正义性时被奥打伤了。",
	"Tyr's followers devote themselves to the cause of justice, to the righting of wrongs and the deliverance of vengeance. This devotion isn't necessarily concerned with equality or fairness, but rather the discovery of truth and the punishment of the guilty. Those who favor Tyr tend to be stiff-necked about matters of theology and laws, seeing things in terms of black and white. Tyr's credo of lawfulness and honesty is a demanding one, and his priests remind the faithful not to hold in contempt others who can't live by it—it wouldn't be an honorable calling if everyone could muster the strength of will to follow it.": "泰尔的追随者致力于正义的事业，致力于纠正错误和传递复仇的力量。这种献身精神不一定与平等或公平有关，而是与发现真相和惩罚罪犯有关。那些支持泰尔的人往往对神学和法律的问题持僵硬态度，以黑白分明的方式看待问题。泰尔的合法和诚实的信条是一个苛刻的信条，他的牧师们提醒信徒们不要蔑视那些不能遵守信条的人--如果每个人都能鼓起意志力来遵守它，那就不是一个光荣的使命了。",
	"Many orders of knighthood are devoted to Tyr, including the Knights of Holy Judgment and the Knights of the Merciful Sword. Such knights-as well as judges and priests, clerics, and paladins who worship Tyr—sometimes wear thin strips of diaphanous cloth over their eyes to remind others of the blindness of justice.": "许多骑士团都献身于泰尔，包括神圣审判骑士团和仁慈之剑骑士团。这类骑士--以及法官和牧师、教士和崇拜泰尔的圣骑士--有时会在眼睛上戴上薄薄的布条，以提醒其他人注意正义的盲目性。",
	"the bitch queen, the queen of the depths, the wavemother": "贱人女王，深海女王，浪母",
	"No community that lives by the sea can ignore the influence of Umberlee, the furious goddess whose tempestuous nature reflects and is reflected by the waters of the deep. Any such community makes sure to host festivals to propitiate the Wavemother and seek her favor. Although mercurial in temperament, she can be generous to those who do her honor, as is any great queen.": "任何生活在海边的社区都不能忽视翁贝利的影响，这位愤怒的女神的暴躁天性反映了深海的水，也被深海的水所反映。任何这样的社区都一定会举办节日来祭祀波浪母亲，并寻求她的青睐。虽然性情多变，但她对那些为她服务的人却很慷慨，正如任何伟大的女王一样。",
	"The Bitch Queen is worshiped out of fear instead of adoration, and ship crews offer her gems, tossed over the side, to calm storm-tossed waters. As her most common moniker suggests, she is viewed as capricious and cruel with no firm ethical outlook; the sea is a savage place, and those who travel it had best be willing to pay the price of challenging her domain.": "人们对女巫的崇拜是出于恐惧，而不是崇拜，船员们把她的宝石扔到船舷上，以平息风暴带来的水灾。正如她最常见的名字所暗示的那样，她被视为任性和残忍，没有坚定的道德观；大海是一个野蛮的地方，那些旅行者最好愿意为挑战她的领域而付出代价。",
	"There is little in the way of an organized clergy of Umberlee. Her priests roam coastal cities, warning of doom and demanding free passage on ships in return for ensuring the goddess's pleasure. Often they wear the colors of waves and storms, and they decorate themselves with items that remind others of the sea's dangerous nature—a necklace of shark teeth, seaweed wrapped about a human bone, and so on. The preserved hand of a drowned person is thought to be a particularly holy object, and some of her few clerics use such severed hands as holy symbols. Umberlee does have a large number of shrines in the coastal cities, and sailors often leave flowers or small candies at them in hopes that she will spare them on their next voyage. Both Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate have true temples dedicated to Umberlee, staffed largely by the widows of sailors lost at sea.": "翁贝雷没有什么有组织的神职人员。她的祭司在沿海城市游荡，警告厄运，并要求船只免费通行，以确保女神的快乐。他们经常穿戴着海浪和风暴的颜色，并以提醒他人海洋危险性的物品来装饰自己--鲨鱼牙齿的项链，包裹着人骨的海草，等等。淹死的人保留下来的手被认为是特别神圣的物品，她的一些少数神职人员把这种断手作为神圣的象征。翁贝里在沿海城市确实有大量的神龛，水手们经常在神龛前留下鲜花或小糖果，希望她能在下一次航行中放过他们。沃特迪普和博德之门都有真正的神庙供奉着翁贝里，工作人员主要是在海上失踪的水手的遗孀。",
	"our lady of gold, the coinmaiden, the merchant's friend": "我们的黄金女士，硬币女郎，商人的朋友",
	"Waukeen is the goddess of wealth and trade, on both sides of the law. Her most ardent worshipers include shopkeepers, members of trading costers, wealthy merchants, caravan guides, itinerant peddlers, moneychangers, and smugglers. She is interested in anything that increases trade and the flow of money, whether new trade routes, new inventions, or the whim of changing fashion. Those who take Waukeen as a patron can be reliably thought of as greedy, but the Coinmaiden is said to frown upon misers and smile upon the industrious and the profligate, and thus priests who bear her holy symbol find themselves welcome in many towns and cities.": "沃基恩是财富和贸易的女神，在法律的两边。她最热心的崇拜者包括店主、贸易商成员、富有的商人、商队向导、流动的小贩、货币兑换商和走私者。她对任何能增加贸易和资金流动的东西都感兴趣，无论是新的贸易路线、新的发明，还是不断变化的时尚的心血来潮。那些以沃肯为赞助人的人可以被可靠地认为是贪婪的，但据说Coinmaiden对守财奴不屑一顾，对勤劳和挥霍的人微笑，因此，带有她神圣标志的牧师发现自己在许多城镇都很受欢迎。",
	"Temples of Waukeen resemble guildhalls and often serve as meeting places for trade consortiums. Those who follow Waukeen's ethos seek to create more opportunity for all and see competition for wealth as one of society's main means of progress. Thus, the faithful of Our Lady of Gold often find themselves at odds with trade guilds and others who would form monopolies. It's common practice among those who seek Waukeen's favor to set aside a tithe of ten percent of their profits, but rather than being given to a temple, the money is meant to be spent to help a struggling business, to finance a new endeavor, or, if all else fails, on frivolous fun.": "Waukeen的寺庙类似于市政厅，经常作为贸易联盟的会议场所。那些遵循Waukeen精神的人寻求为所有人创造更多的机会，并将财富竞争视为社会进步的主要手段之一。因此，黄金圣母的信徒经常发现自己与贸易行会和其他会形成垄断的人发生冲突。在那些寻求沃基恩恩惠的人中，通常的做法是留出他们利润的10%作为什一税，但这些钱不是交给寺庙，而是用来帮助陷入困境的企业，资助新的努力，或者，如果一切都失败了，用于轻浮的乐趣。",
	"This chapter details many of the locales of the Sword Coast and the North, as seen through the eyes and recollections of a person living in Faerûn. Rather than being exhaustive descriptions, what follows are snippets of information drawn from the experience of five individuals who have traversed, lived in, and explored these areas. Like any other narrators, they have opinions and biases, and may be drawing conclusions from incomplete information. No one in the Realms knows everything about any subject, even its oldest and most learned sages, and the views formed from such incomplete information can often suggest an inaccurate conclusion. This is not to say that any of the information the narrators provide is false, only that they may not be entirely knowledgeable in their declarations.": "这一章详细介绍了剑海岸和北方的许多地方，是通过一个生活在法鲁恩的人的眼睛和回忆看到的。下面的内容不是详尽的描述，而是从五个曾经穿越、居住和探索这些地区的人的经验中提取的信息片断。与其他叙述者一样，他们也有自己的观点和偏见，并可能从不完整的信息中得出结论。在这个世界上，没有人对任何问题都了如指掌，即使是最古老和最博学的圣人，从这种不完整的信息中形成的观点往往会暗示出不准确的结论。这并不是说叙述者提供的任何信息都是错误的，只是说他们的声明可能不完全是知识性的。",
	"The details given here only begin to scratch the surface of the adventuring possibilities in the North. Although some of these locales are virtually unknown to outsiders, entire books longer than this one could be (and have been) written about others. If the descriptions leave you wanting to know more, consider them an inducement for you and your companions to visit these places and experience them firsthand.": "这里给出的细节只是开始了解北方冒险的可能性的表面。尽管其中一些地方几乎不为外人所知，但关于其他地方的书可以（而且已经）写得比这本书还长。如果这些描述让你想知道更多，那就把它们当作一种诱因，让你和你的同伴访问这些地方并亲身体验。",
	"Be aware, also, that there is a great deal more to the North than what is presented here. There are ruins without names, and settlements so small as to not even warrant mention in this tome. What lurks in the uncharted areas, waiting to tantalize or perhaps terrorize, is all the more formidable because it can't be anticipated.": "还要注意的是，北方的情况比这里所介绍的要多得多。这里有一些没有名字的废墟，还有一些小的定居点，甚至不值得在这本书中提及。潜伏在未知地区的东西，等待着挑逗或恐吓，因为无法预料，所以更加可怕。",
	"The information in this chapter is intentionally nonspecific with respect to threats, monsters, and statistics. While you can use these details to flavor your descriptions of the towns and cities your players might visit, you should in no way consider these pieces of narration definitive. They're meant to provide touchstones, not to constrain your players to a narrow conception of the world.": "本章中的信息在威胁、怪物和统计数据方面故意不具体。虽然你可以用这些细节来描述你的玩家可能会访问的城镇，但你决不应该认为这些叙述是确定的。它们的目的是提供试金石，而不是把你的玩家限制在一个狭窄的世界概念中。",
	"You might decide to change some of the details, either to surprise your players or to account for events that have transpired since they obtained the information herein. You're encouraged to take what's presented here and make it, and the Forgotten Realms, your own.": "你可能会决定改变一些细节，要么是为了让你的玩家感到惊讶，要么是为了说明在他们获得这里的信息后发生的事件。我们鼓励你把这里的内容变成你自己的，以及被遗忘的王国。",
	"For a century and a half, and more, the Lords' Alliance has stood as the most important and influential group in the north. Its power has kept towns safe from the predations of larger powers, has kept the ambitions of luskan in check, and has taught the rulers of many cities that it is better to cooperate, even for a time, then to merely shut one's doors and allow the storms to rage outside. It was this philosophy that led to the founding of Luruar, and when the lesson was lost, so too were the silver marches. But it serves no purpose to dwell on the folly of the past. Better instead to look to the future, repair the walls, and wait for word from the watching sentries.": "一个半世纪以来，领主联盟一直是北方最重要、最有影响力的团体。它的力量使城镇免受更大势力的掠夺，使卢斯坎的野心受到遏制，并使许多城市的统治者了解到，即使是在一段时间内，合作也比仅仅关起门来让外面的风暴肆虐要好。正是这种哲学导致了鲁鲁修的建立，而当这个教训消失后，银色的游行也随之消失了。但沉浸在过去的愚蠢中是没有意义的。更好的办法是着眼于未来，修复城墙，并等待监视的哨兵的消息。",
	"The Lords' Alliance isn't a nation unto itself, but a partnership of the rulers of towns and cities across the North, who have pledged peace with one another and promised to share information and effort against common threats such as orc hordes and Northlander pirates. It is a loose confederation of those settlements and their agents, all of whom owe allegiance first to their homelands, and second to the Lords' Alliance.": "领主联盟本身并不是一个国家，而是由整个北方的城镇统治者组成的伙伴关系，他们相互承诺和平，并承诺分享信息和努力，以应对共同的威胁，如兽人群和北地人的海盗。这是一个由这些定居点和他们的代理人组成的松散联盟，他们都首先效忠于自己的家乡，其次才是效忠于领主联盟。",
	"In the harsh lands of the North, where winters are cold and monsters and human barbarians regularly stream out of the mountains to pillage outlying settlements, large nations are rare indeed, particularly in the current state of the world. Instead, great city-states have emerged, enriched by trade and protected by stout walls and loyal defenders. Such cities—including Baldur's Gate, Mirabar, Neverwinter, Silverymoon, and Waterdeep—extend their influence into nearby regions, often creating or accepting vassal settlements, but in the end, these realms are cities, driven to consider their own protection and future before other concerns.": "在北方严酷的土地上，冬天很冷，怪物和人类野蛮人经常从山里出来掠夺外围的定居点，大国确实很少，特别是在目前的世界状况下。相反，伟大的城邦已经出现，它们因贸易而致富，受到坚固的城墙和忠诚的守卫者的保护。这些城市--包括博德之门（Baldur's Gate）、米拉巴尔（Mirabar）、永夜（Neverwinter）、银月（Silverymoon）和水底（Waterdeep）--将其影响力扩展到附近地区，经常创建或接受附庸定居点，但最终，这些王国都是城市，在考虑其他问题之前，都会考虑自己的保护和未来。",
	"In the years soon after its founding more than one hundred fifty years ago, there was more interest in membership, and the Alliance accepted some members from farther south. Since then, events such as the growth of Elturgard into a power in its own right, and the recent fall of the Silver Marches, have caused the group to draw in on itself, restricting its membership to powers in the North. The current members of the Alliance are Amphail, Baldur's Gate, Daggerford, Longsaddle, Mirabar, Mithral Hall, Neverwinter, Silverymoon, Waterdeep, and Yartar. There is some doubt that Mithral Hall will be part of the alliance for much longer, but until rulership of the dwarven city is more firmly established, it remains a member.": "在一百五十年前成立后不久的几年里，人们对加入联盟有了更多的兴趣，联盟也接受了一些来自更南边的成员。从那时起，诸如艾尔图加德成长为一个大国，以及最近白银牧场的衰落等事件，使得该组织开始自我收缩，将其成员限制在北方的势力范围内。目前联盟的成员有：安菲儿、博德之门、达格福、长鞍、米拉巴尔、米特拉尔厅、永夜、银月、水底和雅塔尔。有些人怀疑米特拉尔厅会在更长时间内成为联盟的一部分，但在这个矮人城市的统治权更加稳固之前，它仍然是一个成员。",
	"It is impossible to ascribe an overall character to the individual members of the alliance. As a group, the agents of the members are interested in the preservation of civilization in the North, and they share what information they can—and oppose what threats they must—to further that goal. In the end, though, a merchant of Waterdeep and one of Baldur's Gate are concerned mainly for their own purses and the welfare of their home cities, and are unlikely to care what happens to the other, except inasmuch as it affects trade.": "不可能给联盟的个别成员赋予一个总体特征。作为一个团体，成员的代理人对保护北方的文明感兴趣，他们分享他们可以分享的信息，反对他们必须反对的威胁，以促进这一目标。但最终，水底城的商人和博德之门的商人主要关心的是他们自己的钱包和他们家乡城市的福利，不太可能关心对方的情况，除非它影响到贸易。",
	"The advice and insights in this section come from Andwe Cururen, a half-elf native of Silverymoon who was once a Knight in Silver (a member of the city's army), and now serves as an emissary and, when necessary, an active agent for the Lords' Alliance. She travels the North on behalf of the Alliance, representing its interests and gathering and updating information on its settlements for her superiors, fellow agents, and potential recruits, including adventurers who might serve the Alliance or one of its members.": "本节中的建议和见解来自于安迪威-库瑞恩，她是银月城的半精灵，曾经是银色骑士（该城的军队成员），现在担任使者，必要时也是领主联盟的积极代理人。她代表联盟在北方旅行，代表联盟的利益，为她的上司、同僚和潜在的新兵，包括可能为联盟或其成员服务的冒险者，收集和更新有关其定居点的信息。",
	"Named for its founder, a former warlord of Waterdeep, the small town of Amphail is home to just over seven hundred souls, yet it sought and received membership in the Lords' Alliance just under a century ago, thanks to the maneuverings of the noble families that control its lands. Where once it was simply an example of the extent of Waterdeep's reach, Amphail became the playground of that city's noble families, a place where they can scheme against their rivals and send their more rambunctious offspring to unleash some of their destructive tendencies without harming the family's reputation in proper society. As a result of being a member of the Lords' Alliance, Amphail is the equal of such great cities as Neverwinter and Baldur's Gate in matters that concern the other powers of the region, despite its clear inferiority in size and strength.": "安菲勒小镇以其创始人--一位前沃特德普的军阀命名，只有七百多人，但就在不到一个世纪前，由于控制其土地的贵族家庭的操纵，它寻求并获得了领主联盟的成员资格。安菲勒曾经只是沃特德普影响力的一个例子，而现在却成了该市贵族家族的游乐场，他们可以在这里谋划对抗对手，并派他们更粗暴的后代去释放一些破坏性的倾向，而不会损害家族在正规社会的声誉。由于是领主联盟的成员，安菲勒在关系到该地区其他势力的事务上与永夜城和博德之门这样的大城市平起平坐，尽管它在规模和实力上明显逊色。",
	"Amphail's sovereignty means that, although patrols from the Waterdeep City Guard sometimes ride north to check on matters in Amphail, the only true authority in the town is the will of the noble families that control it. The primary business of Amphail is horse ranching, and the town is a fine place to find replacement mounts, and all manner of tack, bridle, feed, and other goods necessary to keep up one's horse. Most farms have farriers, or at least hands that can swiftly shoe a horse, and spare shoes all but litter the town.": "安菲勒的主权意味着，尽管沃特迪普城市卫队的巡逻队有时会骑马北上检查安菲勒的情况，但该镇唯一真正的权威是控制它的贵族家族的意愿。安普海尔的主要业务是养马，镇上是一个寻找替代坐骑的好地方，还有各种马具、辔头、饲料和其他养马所需的物品。大多数农场都有马夫，或者至少有一双能迅速给马穿鞋的手，而备用的鞋子在镇上随处可见。",
	"Visitors to Amphail often get a polite admonishment to \"mind the high born\" or \"ware silver saddles\" from the locals, but those who ignore such warnings should expect no help if they get into trouble with the nobility. Amphailans are by their nature suspicious of and quiet around folk who openly display wealth or status, having learned early in their lives that nobles are folk who like to throw their weight around, to the detriment of anyone nearby without enough coin or a grand enough title to stand up to them. I find that these common folk are ideal sources of information about the very people they distrust.": "来到安菲勒的游客经常会被当地人礼貌地告诫 \"注意那些高高在上的人 \"或 \"银色马鞍\"，但那些无视这些警告的人，如果遇到贵族的麻烦，就别指望得到帮助。安菲拉人天生就对那些公开展示财富或地位的人持怀疑态度，而且在他们的生活中很早就知道，贵族是喜欢四处张扬的人，这对附近没有足够的钱财或足够大的头衔来对抗他们的人来说是不利的。我发现这些普通人是关于他们不信任的人的理想信息来源。",
	"For their part, the young nobles that litter the town seem to make mischief mainly because they can. The feuds and rivalries that would generate only carefully worded insults in the city can escalate into brawls when these miscreants are far from the watchful eyes of their parents. Duels have long been prohibited by mutual agreement, due to the blood feuds they provoked in the past, but hands often drift to sword hilts when heated words are exchanged. Nearly every other sort of noble indiscretion is foisted on the residents of Amphail. Those who suffer property damage or worse at the nobles' hands are forced to forgive the offense in exchange for the application of coin or a promise made in the transgressor's name (suggesting that the youngster's relatives will handle any obligations). Some businesses survive entirely by bringing the comforts of Waterdeep to Amphail, creating gathering places where young nobles can feel at home.": "就他们而言，在镇上随处可见的年轻贵族们似乎主要是因为他们可以做恶作剧。在城市里只会产生小心翼翼的侮辱的仇怨和竞争，当这些捣蛋鬼远离他们父母的监视时，就会升级为斗殴。由于过去引发的血仇，决斗早已被双方协议禁止，但在激烈的言语交锋中，人们的手往往会移向剑柄。几乎所有其他类型的贵族轻率行为都被强加给了安菲勒的居民。那些在贵族手中遭受财产损失或更糟的人被迫原谅罪行，以换取使用硬币或以违法者的名义作出的承诺（暗示年轻人的亲属将处理任何义务）。一些企业完全是通过将沃特德普的舒适性带到安菲勒来生存的，创造了一些让年轻贵族感到宾至如归的聚会场所。",
	"The three greatest families with significant interests in Amphail are Houses Amcathra, Ilzimmer, and Roaringhorn; and most coin and business eventually passes through the hands one of those houses or its intermediaries. When Amphail joined the Lords' Alliance, these three houses were the loudest and most influential voices, and now control the rulership of the town, with the controlling family changing each Shieldmeet. The current Lord Warder is Dauner Ilzimmer, who speaks for the town to the Lords' Alliance. House Amcathra has yet to choose its successor for next Shieldmeet. Houses Jhansczil and Tarm have smaller breeding concerns in the area, and House Eagleshields has holdings near Amphail that it uses to continue its long tradition of caring for unhealthy animals from nearby farms, and offers fine tack and other gear for sale.": "在安菲儿有重大利益的三个最大的家族是Amcathra、Ilzimmer和Roaringhorn家族；大多数钱币和生意最终都要通过这些家族之一或其中间人的手中。当安菲儿加入领主联盟时，这三个家族是最响亮和最有影响力的声音，现在他们控制着该镇的统治权，控制的家族在每一次Shieldmeet上都会改变。目前的守卫长是道纳-伊尔齐默，他代表小镇向领主联盟发言。Amcathra家族还没有选择下一届Shieldmeet的继任者。Jhansczil和Tarm家族在这一地区有较小的育种问题，Eagleshields家族在Amphail附近有土地，用来延续其照顾附近农场的不健康动物的悠久传统，并提供精美的马具和其他装备供出售。",
	"Among the common folk, the Oglyntyr family has the largest and oldest cattle and horse farm in Amphail, and supplies some of the finest Amphail grays (loyal, intelligent steeds favored as personal mounts) to nobles and travelers in the region. A new family, not noble but possessing much wealth, has purchased the old Baldasker ranch. We suspect that the Hemzar family, who were unknown in either Amphail or Waterdeep before the purchase, like most of the mysterious matters in Amphail, may have the secret backing of one noble house or another.": "在普通民众中，奥格伦蒂尔家族拥有安菲勒最大和最古老的牛马场，并向该地区的贵族和旅行者提供一些最好的安菲勒灰马（忠诚、聪明的骏马，作为个人坐骑受到青睐）。一个不是贵族但拥有大量财富的新家庭购买了旧的Baldasker牧场。我们怀疑赫姆扎尔家族，在购买之前在安菲勒和沃特德普都不为人知，就像安菲勒的大多数神秘事件一样，可能有某个贵族家族的秘密支持。",
	"My contacts say the Oglyntyrs have petitioned the Ilzimmers to help crush this upstart business, a move that they are considering. I visited the Hemzar ranch, and I'd consider such a move inadvisable. A large family of Tashlutar descent, they seemed capable and confident of their position, despite my warning. I wasn't allowed the opportunity to explore the property fully, but I did note signs that the Hemzars are prepared to rear and train far more dangerous beasts than horses and cattle. I was then tempted to warn the Oglyntyrs, but that family can be as odious as the worst nobles. These things tend to sort themselves out.": "我的联系人说，奥格兰特人已经向伊尔兹默人请愿，要求他们帮助粉碎这个新起的企业，他们正在考虑这一行动。我访问了Hemzar牧场，我认为这样的举动是不可取的。这是一个有塔什鲁塔人血统的大家庭，尽管我提出了警告，但他们似乎很有能力，对自己的地位很有信心。我没有被允许有机会完全探索该财产，但我确实注意到一些迹象，表明赫姆扎尔人准备饲养和训练远比马和牛更危险的野兽。我当时很想警告奥甘特尔家族，但那个家族和最坏的贵族一样可恶。这些事情往往会自己解决。",
	"The noble families of Waterdeep who send their children to Amphail, or allow them to go there, hope that their sons and daughters will learn some lessons about life while away from Waterdeep. If they are going to cause damage or hurt feelings in the process, at least they will do so far away from the watchful eyes of the other nobility of the city. To the young nobles, there is no one in Amphail of any real consequence who might be permanently harmed by any improprieties. They also believe there is no one of note nearby to hear these hotheaded youngsters issue their boasts and proclaim their schemes—I have more than once learned of a threat simply by listening to children of different houses brag to one another about matters that were meant only for the family.": "沃特德普的贵族家庭把他们的孩子送到安普海尔，或者允许他们去那里，希望他们的儿子和女儿在离开沃特德普时能学到一些关于生活的教训。如果他们要在这个过程中造成损害或伤害感情，至少他们会在远离本市其他贵族的监视下这样做。对年轻的贵族们来说，在安普海尔没有任何真正有影响的人，他们可能会因为任何不当行为而受到永久性的伤害。他们还认为，附近没有人注意到这些头脑发热的年轻人发出的吹嘘和宣扬他们的计划，我曾不止一次地通过听不同家族的孩子们互相吹嘘只属于家族的事情来了解威胁。",
	"Aside from the excesses of its nobles, Amphail is a peaceful town, with the threat of full-scale retaliation from both Waterdeep and the Lords' Alliance casting a long, dark shadow over any plans to disturb matters there. The nobles of Waterdeep have heavy purses, and are willing to spend as much coin as necessary to protect their favored playground—and to punish anyone that might disrupt their control over it. The only thing the nobles don't seem to be able to spend away is the smell of manure, which in the summer months hangs thick over the town. It is that manure that helps to feed the true business of Amphail: feeding Waterdeep with the produce from the many farms that surround the town.": "除了贵族们的过度行为之外，安菲勒是一个和平的小镇，来自沃特德普和领主联盟的全面报复的威胁给任何扰乱那里的计划投下了漫长的黑暗阴影。沃特德普的贵族们有着沉重的钱包，他们愿意花费尽可能多的钱来保护他们喜爱的游乐场，并惩罚任何可能破坏他们对游乐场控制的人。贵族们唯一不能花掉的东西是粪便的味道，在夏天的几个月里，粪便的味道在小镇上空弥漫。正是这些粪便帮助养活了安菲勒的真正业务：用镇子周围许多农场的产品喂养沃特迪普。",
	"Because so many of Amphail's farms are owned by House Ammakyl, members of that noble family are by far the most enriched by the commerce there. They consider themselves good landlords to the folk that farm their lands, and are sure to bring any threats to honest, hard-working commoners to the attention of both the Lord Warder and the Lords of Waterdeep. Anything that threatens farming in Amphail threatens the City of Splendors directly, and such situations are dealt with swiftly and surely by the city's Guard. As a result, even the most rebellious nobles are careful not to tread too heavily on Ammakyl turf in Amphail, as a house that does so might swiftly find its favorite foods suddenly difficult to procure for a revel or some other event where the family's status is at risk.": "因为安菲儿的许多农场都属于阿玛基尔家族，所以到目前为止，该贵族家族的成员在那里的商业活动中是最富有的。他们认为自己是耕种土地的好地主，并且一定会将任何威胁到诚实、勤劳的平民的行为提交给看守大人和沃特德普的领主。任何威胁到安菲勒农业的行为都会直接威胁到辉煌之城，这种情况会被城市的卫队迅速而有效地处理。因此，即使是最叛逆的贵族也会小心翼翼地避免在安普海尔的安玛基尔地盘上踩上一脚，因为这样做的家族可能很快就会发现自己最喜欢的食物在狂欢或其他一些家族地位受到威胁的活动中突然难以采购了。",
	"On the Coast Way, some forty miles upstream along the River Chionthar from the Sword Coast, lies the bustling city of Baldur's Gate. Home to tens of thousands, the harbor city has poor soil, but its sheltered bay, well away from the tides that batter the coast, make it an ideal location for trading goods from locations to the west in the Sea of Swords, inland along the river, and up and down the coast. Baldur's Gate is a place of commerce, and the city enjoys great success handling the coins of other powers and making them its own.": "在海岸线上，从剑海岸沿奇安特河向上游约40英里处，坐落着繁华的博德之门城市。这座海港城市有数万居民，土壤贫瘠，但它有一个避风的海湾，远离冲击海岸的潮汐，使它成为从西边的剑海、内陆的河流和海岸的上下游进行货物交易的理想地点。博德之门是一个商业发达的地方，这个城市在处理其他国家的钱币并使之成为自己的钱币方面取得了巨大成功。",
	"Sadly, Baldur's Gate has a storied connection with the dark god, Bhaal. Just a few years ago, the city saw the terrifying return of the Lord of Murder. Following a number of deaths, one of the city's dukes, Torlin Silvershield, was revealed as the Chosen of Bhaal, and underwent a monstrous transformation, turning many citizens into bloodthirsty killers and inspiring a riot and much death before finally being put down by brave adventurers. Even now, murderous echoes ripple through the city and beyond, and reports of unexplainable, gruesome killings flow out of Baldur's Gate.": "可悲的是，博德之门与黑暗之神Bhaal有着不解之缘。就在几年前，这座城市看到了杀人魔王可怕的回归。在许多人死亡之后，该城的一位公爵，托林-西尔弗斯盾（Torlin Silvershield）被发现是巴哈尔的选民，并经历了一个可怕的转变，将许多市民变成了嗜血的杀手，激发了一场骚乱和许多死亡，最终被勇敢的冒险家们镇压。即使是现在，谋杀的回声在城市和其他地方荡漾开来，关于无法解释的、可怕的杀戮的报告从博德之门流出来。",
	"Baldur's Gate is ruled by the Council of Four, dukes who vote among themselves on matters of law and policy for the city. A single grand duke is chosen from among the four, and is empowered to break ties when the council is deadlocked. The current Grand Duke is Ulder Ravengard, who is joined by Dukes Thalamra Vanthampur, Belynne Stelmane, and Dillard Portyr, the former grand duke, who ceded the post to Ravengard after the city's recent troubles. Below the council sits the Parliament of Peers, a group of about fifty Baldurians who meet daily (though almost never in full number) to discuss the future of the city and recommend actions for the dukes to take on all matters, great and small. At any given time, roughly one-quarter of the peers are powerful members of Lower City society, with the rest drawn from the Upper City's noble families, called patriars.": "博德之门由四人议会统治，公爵们在城市的法律和政策问题上相互投票。从四人中选出一位大公，并有权在议会陷入僵局时打破僵局。现任大公是乌尔德-拉文加德，与他一起的还有塔拉姆拉-范坦普尔公爵、贝林恩-斯特尔曼恩公爵和迪拉德-波蒂尔公爵，前大公在该市最近的麻烦之后将职位让给了拉文加德。议会下面是议员会议，一个由大约50名鲍杜尔人组成的小组，他们每天开会（尽管几乎从不满员），讨论城市的未来，并就所有大小事务向公爵们建议采取的行动。在任何时候，大约有四分之一的议员是下城社会的有权势的成员，其余的来自上城的贵族家庭，称为元老。",
	"Defense of the Upper City is handled by the Watch, the official constabulary of the city's elite. Their duty is to defend the patriars and enforce their laws, and little else. For the rest of Baldur's Gate, security is enforced and order maintained by the Flaming Fist mercenary company, a supposedly neutral force which is free to fight in external conflicts, so long as it doesn't side against Baldur's Gate. By tradition, the highest officer of the Flaming Fist is one of the city's dukes, and Grand Duke Ulder Ravengard fulfills that tradition proudly. Membership in the Flaming Fist is fairly easy to achieve, and adventurers with much experience swiftly advance in rank (and, consequently, political influence) once they become permanent members. Many ranking officers are former adventurers who have \"retired\" to military life.": "上城的防御工作由守望者负责，他们是城市精英的官方警察。他们的职责是保卫元老们，执行他们的法律，除此之外没有其他任务。对于博德之门的其他地区，安全由火焰之拳雇佣兵公司执行，秩序由其维持，这是一支所谓的中立部队，只要不站在博德之门一边，就可以在外部冲突中自由作战。按照传统，火焰之拳的最高官员是该城的公爵之一，而大公Ulder Ravengard自豪地履行了这一传统。火焰之拳的成员资格相当容易获得，拥有丰富经验的冒险者一旦成为永久成员，就会迅速提升等级（以及随之而来的政治影响力）。许多高级军官都是以前的冒险家，他们已经 \"退休\"，过上了军事生活。",
	"In both the Upper and Lower Cities, the underworld is controlled by a shadowy group known merely as the Guild. The dukes don't acknowledge the power of this group in any meaningful way—at least not publicly—but try (at least nominally) to curb its influence where and how they can. I lost count of how many gangs claim territory in the Lower and Outer City, and all of them seem to owe allegiance to the Guild. Efforts to destroy the Guild have thus far failed, due in part to the inability of outsiders to identify a clear leader of the group, but in no small measure to the shameful lack of effort on the part of the rulers of the city to protect its people.": "在上城和下城，黑社会都被一个仅被称为公会的阴暗团体所控制。公爵们不以任何有意义的方式承认这个组织的力量--至少不公开承认--但他们试图（至少在名义上）在可能的地方和方式上遏制其影响。我已经数不清有多少帮派在下城和外城宣称拥有领土，而他们似乎都效忠于公会。到目前为止，摧毁公会的努力已经失败了，部分原因是外人无法确定该组织的明确领导人，但在很大程度上是由于城市的统治者没有努力保护其人民，这是令人羞愧的。",
	"The Upper City of Baldur's Gate is the enclosed haven of the city's nobility—the patriars. Sitting atop their hill, the patriars look down on the rest of Baldur's Gate in every real sense, wielding their wealth and influence to push the Council of Four to protect their lifestyle. Though at one time a wealthy merchant or powerful adventurer might hope to advance to the ranks of the patriars, there is no longer room, physically or otherwise, for the class of the Upper City to grow. Now, only those born into the patriar families inhabit the manors of this oldest part of Baldur's Gate. The poorest among these go so far as to sell furnishings and decorations from inside their homes in order to keep up appearances with their fellow patriars.": "博德之门的上城是城市贵族的封闭天堂--族长们。坐落在山顶上的族长们从各种实际意义上俯视着博德之门的其他地方，利用他们的财富和影响力来推动四人议会保护他们的生活方式。虽然曾经有一个富裕的商人或强大的冒险家可能希望晋升到族长的行列，但现在已经没有空间了，无论是身体上还是其他方面，上层城市的阶级已经不再增长。现在，只有那些出生在族长家族的人居住在博德之门这个最古老的地区的庄园里。这些人中最穷的人甚至卖掉了家里的家具和装饰品，以保持他们的同族的形象。",
	"Most would say that the lives of patriars are marked by luxury and decadence, and for a great many of them, this is likely true. However, some families do make an honest attempt at improving the city, and nearly every family has at least one member who engages in major commerce—no matter one's heritage, everyone must have coin in order to eat. There is but one nonhuman family among the patriars, the dwarven Shattershields, who have been in Baldur's Gate for long enough that they are just as accomplished as their human peers at looking down on the rest of the citizenry.": "大多数人会说，爱国者的生活以奢侈和颓废为标志，对他们中的许多人来说，这可能是事实。然而，有些家庭确实为改善城市做出了真诚的尝试，而且几乎每个家庭都至少有一个成员从事主要的商业活动--不管一个人的遗产如何，每个人都必须有硬币才能吃饭。在族长中只有一个非人类家族，即矮人Shattershields家族，他们在博德之门已经有足够长的时间，以至于他们和他们的人类同龄人一样善于看不起其他公民。",
	"A number of gates divide the Upper City from the Lower City, but the one to note is the famous Baldur's Gate, from which the city takes its name. Trade passes only through this gate, and is taxed by the city—despite the fact that it was just such taxes that led to the city's being overthrown by its first dukes and the Lower City enclosed by its ring wall. The other gates exist solely for the convenience of the patriars and their retinues. Any who aren't in the presence of a patriar, wearing a patriar's livery, or bearing a letter of proof of employment by a patriar must use Baldur's Gate to pass between the Upper and Lower Cities. Bear this in mind when trying to sneak from one part of the city to the next.": "许多门将上城和下城分开，但最值得注意的是著名的博德门，城市的名字就来源于此。贸易只通过这道门，并由城市征税--尽管正是这样的税收导致城市被第一批公爵推翻，下城被环形墙包围。其他城门的存在只是为了方便族长和他们的随从。任何没有族长在场、没有穿着族长制服、没有携带族长雇佣证明信的人，都必须使用Baldur门在上城和下城之间通行。在试图从城市的一个部分潜入到另一个部分时，请记住这一点。",
	"Hard against the harbor lies the Lower City, where stone, slate-roofed houses stand (sometimes unsteadily), and the folk who have long performed the real work of the city reside. Baldur's Gate depends on trade, and that trade flows in and out of the Gray Harbor. The hands that load and unload ships, that tally cargo and haul goods, that repair keels and mend sails, all live here. The damp clings heavily in this portion of the city—some say it's held in by the Old Wall—and lamps (lit and filled by citizens, not the city) pierce the fog. Most locals are wise enough to carry lanterns or lamps, and visitors that have not learned to do so can usually hire a young Baldurian to guide them through the streets.": "靠着港口的地方是下城，那里矗立着石头、板条屋顶的房屋（有时是不稳定的），居住着长期从事城市真正工作的人们。博德之门依赖于贸易，而贸易则是在灰色港湾里进进出出。装载和卸载船只的人，统计货物和运输货物的人，修理龙骨和修补船帆的人，都住在这里。在城市的这一部分，湿气很重--有人说它被老墙挡住了--而灯（由市民点燃和填充，而不是城市）穿透了雾气。大多数当地人都有足够的智慧来携带灯笼或灯具，而没有学会这样做的游客通常可以雇用一个年轻的Baldurian来引导他们穿过街道。",
	"The Lower City was long ago walled in to benefit from the protection of the city, but the divide between the two wards is as stark as it has ever been. The Flaming Fist is responsible for keeping order in the Lower City, and do so with brutal efficiency, deterring most from engaging in bold, public acts of theft, vandalism, or violence.": "下城在很久以前就被围起来，以便从城市的保护中获益，但两个区之间的鸿沟还是一如既往的明显。火焰之拳负责维持下城的秩序，并以残酷的效率维持秩序，阻止大多数人参与大胆的、公开的盗窃、破坏或暴力行动。",
	"Where merchants in other cities might hope to one day join the nobility, in Baldur's Gate the best one can hope for is to become an absurdly wealthy and influential merchant. Becoming a patriar is out of the question. Still, the wealthiest Baldurians live as much like the patriars as they can, buying up adjacent properties in the hopes of demolishing them in order to build large homes to echo the manors of the Upper City. The Bloomridge district has a number of such homes, and some of the patriars grumble that these merchants are growing too comfortable with their new status.": "其他城市的商人可能希望有一天能加入贵族行列，而在《博德之门》中，人们最好的希望是成为一个荒谬的富有和有影响力的商人。成为一名族长是不可能的。不过，最富有的Baldur人还是尽可能地过着和元老们一样的生活，他们买下邻近的房产，希望能把它们拆掉，以便建造大型住宅，与上城的庄园相呼应。布卢姆里奇区有许多这样的房子，一些爱国者抱怨说，这些商人对他们的新地位越来越满意了。",
	"Outside the walls, there are no laws barring construction or settlement, and so those who are too poor to reside within the city or to purchase property have slowly built up a third ward of the city, living in the shadow of its walls, paying its taxes, and covering both sides of the roads leading into Baldur's Gate. Here, the poorest of the poor live in the Outer City, but so too do those whose businesses are considered too troublesome, noisy, or foul-smelling to operate within the walls, so tanners, smiths, masons, dyers, and other tradesfolk abound. The city does woefully little to help the folk here, and charitable souls (myself included) sometimes start at one end of the road with a full purse, only to see it empty by the time they reach the other end.": "在城墙外，没有任何法律禁止建筑或定居，因此那些太过贫穷而无法在城内居住或购买房产的人慢慢地建立了城市的第三区，生活在城墙的阴影下，缴纳城墙税，并覆盖通往博德之门的道路两侧。在这里，最穷的人住在外城，但那些被认为在城墙内经营太麻烦、太吵、太臭的人也住在外城，所以制革工人、铁匠、泥瓦匠、染匠和其他商人比比皆是。城市对这里的人们的帮助少得可怜，慈善家们（包括我自己）有时会带着满满的钱包从路的一端开始，但当他们到达另一端时却发现钱包已经空了。",
	"The lack of laws in the Outer City has led to two strange phenomena, unrelated to one another. A walled Calishite district has grown up to the east of the city proper, known by Baldurians as Little Calimshan. Within the district, neighborhoods are divided by walls, but these walls have walkways atop them so that foot traffic can proceed unimpeded by the gates that slow carts and mounts. Here, refugees from Calimshan have found a home away from that southern nation, and largely depend on themselves for trade, culture, and defense.": "外城缺乏法律，导致了两个奇怪的现象，彼此之间没有关联。在城市的东部，一个有墙的卡利希特区已经发展起来，被Baldurian称为小卡利姆山。在这个地区，居民区被城墙分割开来，但这些城墙上面有人行道，因此，步行交通可以不受减缓马车和坐骑的城门的阻碍。在这里，来自卡里姆山的难民找到了一个远离南方国家的家，他们主要依靠自己的贸易、文化和防御。",
	"Buildings have also been constructed along Wyrm's Crossing over the Chionthar. Shops, taverns, and tenements choke the bridge, hanging from both spans, and even in some cases built to hang from the supports that hold it up. Folk must pay a toll to cross on foot or by cart or wagon, but many swear they would pay yet more to be able to use the bridge without having to dodge the hawkers and urchins that infest the area.": "沿着奇安特河上的维尔姆十字路口也建起了建筑物。商店、酒馆和租房扼杀在桥上，悬挂在两个跨度上，甚至在某些情况下，建在支撑它的支架上。民众必须支付通行费才能步行或乘车或马车过桥，但许多人发誓他们会支付更多的钱来使用这座桥，而不必躲避侵扰该地区的小贩和顽童。",
	"Built against the side of a low hill on the floodplains of the Delimbiyr, this small, walled town is dominated by the keep of the local duchess, Lady Morwen Daggerford. Counting the town itself and the nearby hamlets and farms that look to it for protection and guidance, some twelve hundred people call the area home. Lady Morwen is the sister of the previous duke, Maldwyn Daggerford, and she seems a capable and charismatic leader. The Daggerford family's authority over the area dates back to the ancient Kingdom of Man that succeeded Phalorm in the region. Though that realm has been dust for centuries, there are those that see Daggerford as the last bastion of a better time of peace, wealth, and influence—a time that, given the right leadership, has the smallest of chances of being restored.": "这座有围墙的小城建在德林拜尔河洪泛区的一座低矮山丘边上，由当地公爵夫人莫文-达格福特女士的城堡主导。算上小镇本身以及附近的小村庄和农场的保护和指导，大约有一千二百人把这个地区当作自己的家。莫文夫人是前任公爵马尔德温-达格福特的妹妹，她似乎是一个有能力、有魅力的领导者。Daggerford家族对该地区的权力可以追溯到在该地区接替Phalorm的古老的人类王国。虽然那个王国已经尘封了几个世纪，但有些人将Daggerford视为和平、财富和影响力的美好时代的最后堡垒--如果有正确的领导，这个时代有最小的机会被恢复。",
	"Daggerford is a pastoral haven. Wide, sprawling hills nearby offer peaceful vistas, but are sometimes overrun by raiding orcs or goblins. The frequent caravans heading north to Waterdeep or south to Baldur's Gate need escort or guarding, and can offer news of both of those cities (and the settlements between them). Several inns stand ready to accept visitors, except in the busiest of trade or festival periods, when they fill swiftly, and many locals open up their homes to lodgers. Warriors in need of coin can help their purses by offering their services as trainers for the local militia, or accompanying the town guard on its patrols.": "Daggerford是一个牧民的天堂。附近宽阔无垠的山丘提供了宁静的视野，但有时会被突袭的兽人或哥布林侵占。经常有商队向北前往沃特迪普（Waterdeep）或向南前往博德之门（Baldur's Gate），需要护送或守卫，并能提供这两个城市（以及它们之间的定居点）的消息。除了在最繁忙的贸易或节日期间，有几家旅店随时准备接受游客，这时他们会迅速坐满，许多当地人会向住宿者开放他们的家。需要钱的勇士们可以通过为当地民兵提供训练员的服务来帮助他们的钱包，或者陪同镇上的卫队进行巡逻。",
	"Daily rulership is in the hands of the Council of Guilds, composed of the heads of the town's informal trade groups. These guildmasters believe themselves more powerful and influential than they truly are, imitating the Lords of Waterdeep by going robed and masked to council meetings. This charade, in the eyes of most, borders on farce, as everyone in Daggerford knows precisely who the council members are, and no magic disguises the forms, voices, or mannerisms of the guild leaders, and a trained spy can learn which guildmaster is which after only an evening or two of proper observation.": "日常统治权掌握在行会理事会手中，该理事会由该镇的非正式贸易团体的负责人组成。这些行会会长认为自己比实际情况更强大，更有影响力，他们模仿水底世界的领主，穿着长袍，戴着面具参加理事会会议。在大多数人眼里，这种戏法近乎于闹剧，因为在达格福德的每个人都清楚地知道谁是理事会成员，没有任何魔法可以掩盖公会领导人的形态、声音或举止，一个训练有素的间谍只需经过一两个晚上的适当观察就能知道哪个公会会长是谁。",
	"The largest and oldest building in Daggerford is the ducal castle, a three-level keep enclosed by a two-story wall that contains its own smithy, a wide parade ground, and stabling for a large number of animals. The dukes of Daggerford have always kept a well-stocked larder, capable of feeding the castle's inhabitants and any citizens that might shelter inside during a siege.": "达格福最大和最古老的建筑是公爵城堡，这是一个由两层墙围起来的三层堡垒，里面有自己的铁匠铺，一个宽阔的阅兵场，以及大量动物的马厩。Daggerford的公爵们一直保持着一个充足的储藏室，能够喂饱城堡的居民和任何在围攻期间可能躲在里面的公民。",
	"Three gates lead into the town of Daggerford: River Gate, which provides access to the river, and through which shipping cargo is carted into the town proper; Caravan Gate, which handles most landgoing traffic, including land-based trade; and Farmers' Gate, which remains open at nearly all times, but is wide enough only to let one wagon or cart pass at a time.": "有三道门通往达格福特镇。河门是通往河边的通道，航运货物通过河门进入小镇；大篷车门负责处理大多数陆路交通，包括陆路贸易；农夫门几乎在任何时候都是开放的，但其宽度只够一次让一辆马车或小车通过。",
	"A militia guards Daggerford. Militia service is mandatory for all able-bodied adults, and lasts for twenty years. All citizens living within the town receive instruction from the duchess's own soldiers in the use of spears and other weapons, and must spend at least one day a month in defense of the town, standing sentry on its walls or patrolling the nearby roads. Their training means that the common citizens of Daggerford aren't easily cowed by armed folk demanding goods, coin, or passage, and are slightly more likely to take up work as mercenaries, caravan guards, or adventurers.": "一支民兵队守卫着Daggerford。所有身体健康的成年人都必须参加民兵服务，持续时间为20年。所有住在镇上的公民都要接受公爵夫人自己的士兵的指导，学习如何使用长矛和其他武器，并且每个月必须至少花一天时间来保卫城镇，在城墙上放哨或在附近的道路上巡逻。他们的训练意味着Daggerford的普通市民不会轻易被要求提供货物、硬币或通行证的武装分子吓倒，他们更有可能从事雇佣兵、商队守卫或冒险家的工作。",
	"Although she is less amiable than her brother was, Lady Morwen is acknowledged as more capable of ruling Daggerford than Duke Maldwyn had been. She is well liked by the people, who understand that she has an honorable heart, and wishes what is best for Daggerford. She regularly trains with the militia, and is seen in the town wearing armor just as often as she is adorned in the finery befitting her station. She often visits the local shrine to Tempus, which only enhances her reputation as a pious woman. Lady Morwen's features are only now starting to age, as though catching up with her white hair.": "虽然她没有她哥哥那么和蔼可亲，但莫文夫人被公认为比马尔德温公爵更有能力统治达格福。她深受人们的喜爱，人们明白她有一颗可敬的心，并希望为达格福特带来最好的东西。她经常与民兵一起训练，在镇上经常看到她穿着盔甲，就像她穿着适合她地位的衣服一样。她经常拜访当地的Tempus神庙，这只会提高她作为一个虔诚女人的声誉。莫文夫人的五官现在才开始衰老，仿佛赶上了她的白发。",
	"Most folk of Daggerford know one another, at least casually, by sight. Strangers are usually welcome, especially if they have coin to spend, unless such folk come armed and belligerent through the town. Guards stationed at each gate make note of new faces, but don't take action against those they don't recognize unless they are given reason to do so.": "Daggerford的大多数人都互相认识，至少是随便看看。陌生人通常是受欢迎的，特别是如果他们有硬币可以花，除非这些人带着武器和好战的态度穿过小镇。驻扎在各大门的卫兵会注意到新面孔，但除非有理由，否则不会对那些他们不认识的人采取行动。",
	"The largest of the town's inns, the River Shining Tavern, is the second biggest building in Daggerford, and the site of many local celebrations and gatherings. Here, the wealthy come to eat and relax. The inn is old—many locals claim it to be older even than the ducal castle—and to many, is the very soul of Daggerford. The Silver Flood Inn and Lizard's Gizzard also offer rooms, though the latter has no food to provide its guests, only beds.": "镇上最大的客栈--闪亮河酒馆，是达格福特第二大建筑，也是当地许多庆祝活动和聚会的场所。在这里，富人会来吃饭和放松。这家客栈很古老，许多当地人声称它甚至比公爵城堡还要古老，对许多人来说，它是达格福的灵魂。银色洪水旅馆和蜥蜴之胗也提供房间，尽管后者没有食物提供给客人，只有床。",
	"One of Daggerford's most unusual businesses is the Sword Coast Traders' Bank, which accepts deposits from traveling merchants and enables them to receive these funds at a similar location in either Waterdeep or Baldur's Gate. Lady Belinda Anteos (of the Waterdeep noble house) promises that her business is secure and that the bank's magical means of communicating precise amounts of currency between cities can't be tampered with.": "Daggerford最不寻常的业务之一是剑岸商人银行，它接受旅行商人的存款，并使他们能够在Waterdeep或Baldur's Gate的一个类似地点收到这些资金。贝琳达-安特欧斯女士（沃特迪普贵族家族）承诺她的生意是安全的，银行在城市间传递精确货币数量的神奇手段是无法被篡改的。",
	"Members of local guilds that do business outside the town don't entirely trust the Traders' Bank, preferring instead to borrow coin from the Hardcheese family of halflings that run the Happy Cow tavern. The Alliance officially has no preference, but I find Lady Anteos trustworthy enough to be an alternative to carrying large sums on the road. It's easier to part with a small portion of one's purse than to lose everything to a band of brigands during a journey through the wilds.": "在镇外做生意的当地行会成员并不完全信任商人银行，而是更愿意从经营快乐牛酒馆的半身人哈德奇斯家族那里借钱。联盟官方并无偏好，但我发现安特奥斯女士值得信赖，足以成为携带大笔资金上路的一个选择。与其在荒野的旅途中被一伙强盗夺走所有的东西，不如把钱包里的一小部分分出来。",
	"Visitors to Daggerford are advised both to avoid the tannery to the west and to swiftly cross Tyndal's Bridge when approaching from the south. The tannery's location, up on the hill, does little to contain the stink of the process, and the Watermen's Guild dumps the city's waste over the side of the bridge. On hot days, the scents exuded from both sites can be overwhelming, which is why I have again asked the Alliance to assign a different agent to visit on next summer's rounds.": "建议来到达格福的游客避开西边的制革厂，并在从南边来的时候迅速穿过丁达尔桥。制革厂的位置在山上，几乎无法抑制制革过程中的臭味，而水手公会则将城市的垃圾倾倒在桥的一侧。在炎热的日子里，这两个地方散发的气味会让人难以忍受，这就是为什么我再次要求联盟指派一名不同的代理人在明年夏天的巡视中访问。",
	"Tyndal's Bridge is a low stone structure over which travelers pass when approaching from the west, where a local boy named Tyndal held off a number of lizardfolk with only a dagger. He grew to manhood, married the local ruler's daughter, named himself duke, and built Daggerford atop the ruins of an older castle. This story, and most of the area's history, is happily related to any who ask by Sir Darfin Floshin, an elf older than Daggerford itself. He longs to see a rise in cooperation between humans, dwarves, and elves in the region, such as was once embodied in the realm of Phalorm. Darfin has been advisor to many dukes of Daggerford through the years. Though he was rebuffed by Duke Maldwyn during his reign, there are signs that Lady Morwen may be more receptive to the advice of a gold elf who has witnessed the fall of the human kingdom of Delimbiyran, the founding of Daggerford, and all the days since.": "丁达尔桥是一个低矮的石头结构，旅行者从西边走过来时都要经过这个桥。当地一个叫丁达尔的男孩在那里只用一把匕首就挡住了许多蜥蜴人。他长大成人，娶了当地统治者的女儿，自封为公爵，并在一座古老城堡的废墟上建造了Daggerford。这个故事，以及这个地区的大部分历史，都由达尔芬-弗洛辛爵士愉快地告诉任何询问的人，他是一个比达格福特本身更古老的精灵。他渴望看到人类、矮人和精灵之间的合作在这个地区的兴起，就像曾经体现在Phalorm王国中的那样。多年来，Darfin一直是Daggerford的许多公爵的顾问。虽然他在马尔德温公爵统治期间被他回绝了，但有迹象表明，莫文夫人可能更容易接受一个金精灵的建议，他见证了人类王国德林拜伦的衰落、达格福的建立，以及此后的所有日子。",
	"The hamlet of Longsaddle is little more than a row of buildings on either side of the Long Road, halfway along the lengthy journey from Triboar to Mirabar. A path leaves the road here and winds to the Ivy Mansion, the great house of the wizards of the Harpell family. Since the Harpells founded the town more than four centuries ago, they have brooked little nonsense and less mayhem. Their own behavior sometimes borders on the bizarre and can be disturbing—they once turned two rival sects of Malarites into rabbits for disturbing Longsaddle with their squabbles, leaving them at the mercy of the predators they had honored—but they are one of the most potent gatherings of mages anywhere in the North.": "长鞍村只不过是长路两边的一排建筑，在从特里波尔到米拉巴尔的漫长旅程的中途。一条小路在这里离开公路，蜿蜒至常春藤大厦，这是哈佩尔家族的巫师的大房子。自从哈佩尔家族在四个多世纪前建立这个小镇以来，他们几乎没有容忍过任何胡言乱语，更没有容忍过混乱。他们自己的行为有时近乎怪异，而且可能令人不安--他们曾经把两个敌对的马拉里派教徒变成了兔子，因为他们的争吵扰乱了龙鞍，使他们不得不听从他们所尊敬的掠食者的摆布--但他们是北方任何地方最有力的法师聚会之一。",
	"The Harpells are a jovial, if insular, lot. All wizards, they tend to marry wizards as well, and the elder women of the family (by blood or marriage) set the course for the house and utterly rule matters within the Ivy Mansion. The family takes on a number of apprentice wizards, using them for menial tasks and for basic defense of Longsaddle. Some apprentices are often the inadvertent test subjects for an experimental spell, but such is the danger of apprenticing to the Harpells. It is likely this spirit of experimentation that caused the Harpells to found their town so far away from other settlements. Young wizards with oddly sized or shaped limbs, strange hair color, or shifting forms are fairly common sights in Longsaddle, not surprising to locals though they might give visitors pause.": "哈珀尔家族是一个欢快的，甚至是孤僻的群体。他们都是巫师，也倾向于与巫师结婚，家族中的长者（通过血缘或婚姻）为家族设定了方向，并完全统治了常春藤大厦内的事务。该家族招收了一些巫师学徒，用他们来做一些琐碎的工作，以及对长沙的基本防御。一些学徒往往是实验性法术的无心试验对象，但这就是向哈珀尔家族学徒的危险。很可能正是这种实验精神导致哈佩尔人在远离其他定居点的地方建立了他们的城镇。肢体大小或形状奇特、头发颜色怪异或形态多变的年轻巫师在龙鞍镇相当常见，对当地人来说并不奇怪，但他们可能会让游客感到不安。",
	"Given the Harpells' reputation as powerful wizards, and the sheer number of them, there is no shortage of folk poking around Longsaddle and the nearby lands hoping to discover caches of magic, hidden like children's treasures. Of course, few, if any, such bundles exist, but the locals draw no shortage of entertainment from sending would-be thieves on grand chases for wands, rings, and other magic trinkets that any prudent person would realize simply don't exist. After all, if the average trader in Longsaddle knew where powerful magic was located, he would be more likely, down the years, to try to claim it.": "鉴于哈佩尔人作为强大的巫师的名声，以及他们的数量，不乏有民间人士在龙鞍和附近的土地上打探，希望发现像儿童宝藏一样藏匿的魔法。当然，这样的包袱即使有也是少之又少，但当地人不乏娱乐活动，让那些可能的小偷大肆追逐魔杖、戒指和其他魔法饰品，而任何谨慎的人都会意识到这些东西根本不存在。毕竟，如果Longsaddle的普通商人知道强大的魔法在哪里，他就会更有可能在这些年里试图索取它。",
	"The primary business of Longsaddle is ranching, and the lands surrounding the village are dominated by hundreds of ranches and farms of every sort and size, from tiny horse farms to great fields of cattle. During those days that livestock are brought in for trading, Longsaddle is a dusty, noise-filled place, with the sounds of the animals competing with the shouts of farmers hoping to sell their goods.": "Longsaddle的主要业务是放牧，村子周围的土地被数以百计的各种类型和规模的牧场和农场所占据，从小小的马场到大片的牛场。在牲畜被运来交易的那些日子里，Longsaddle是一个尘土飞扬、充满噪音的地方，动物的声音与希望出售货物的农民的喊叫声相互竞争。",
	"At all other times, it's a quiet, almost sleepy hamlet, except when the booming reverberation of a Harpell-crafted spell breaks the silence. The family is constantly researching magic both old and new, and twisting spells and rituals into interesting (to them) innovations. This proclivity has prompted them to surround Ivy Mansion with as many magical wards as the family can muster, in order to protect the populace from an errant explosion, terrifying illusion, or the odd, galloping horse of lightning speeding by.": "在其他时候，这里是一个安静的、几乎令人昏昏欲睡的小村庄，除非是哈珀尔制作的咒语的轰鸣回响打破了这种寂静。该家族不断研究新旧魔法，并将咒语和仪式扭曲成有趣的（对他们来说）创新。这种癖好促使他们在常春藤大厦周围设置了家族所能容纳的尽可能多的魔法屏障，以保护民众不受错误的爆炸、可怕的幻觉或奇怪的、飞驰而过的闪电之马的影响。",
	"Several businesses designed to attract travelers stand in Longsaddle, if for no other reason than travel along the well-named Long Road can be tiresome. The first is the Gilded Horseshoe, an old inn to the west of the road that serves fine food and drink, offers comfortable beds, and is close enough to the Ivy Mansion that no one would dare disturb it or its guests. The owners have access to some of the choicest cuts of meat in Longsaddle, and as a result, their roasts and stews are exquisite.": "有几家旨在吸引旅行者的企业矗立在龙鞍镇，如果没有其他原因的话，沿着名字好听的长路旅行会让人感到厌烦。首先是镀金马蹄铁，这是一家位于路西的古老旅馆，提供精美的食物和饮料，提供舒适的床铺，而且离常春藤大厦足够近，没有人敢打扰它或它的客人。店主可以获得龙须沟一些最优质的肉类，因此，他们的烤肉和炖肉都非常精致。",
	"Across the road, the Ostever family serves as the local slaughterer and butcher for folk wishing to take meat, rather than live animals, away from Longsaddle. Rumor holds that the sausages have much improved down the years but buyers are advised to \"mind the tusks\" by locals, a reference to an old joke that none remember. Folk willing to wait can have the able hands of the Ostevers perform a slaughter, hanging, dressing, and packing for them, though this process is likely to take days longer than most travelers can spare.": "在马路对面，奥斯特弗家族是当地的屠宰商和屠夫，为希望从龙须沟带走肉类而不是活体动物的人们服务。有传言说，这些年来，香肠的质量有了很大的提高，但当地人建议买主 \"注意牙齿\"，这指的是一个古老的笑话，但没有人记得。愿意等待的人可以让奥斯特夫家的能手为他们进行宰杀、悬挂、穿衣和包装，尽管这个过程可能要比大多数旅行者的时间长几天。",
	"There is entertainment to be had at the Gambling Golem, where cheaters in the card or dice games are tossed out into the street, and a local marbles game known as scattershields is popular. Dry goods, candles, lanterns, saddles, rope, and wagon wheels are available from a number of other shops.": "在赌神那里有娱乐活动，在纸牌或骰子游戏中作弊的人被扔到街上，而当地一种被称为散弹的弹珠游戏也很受欢迎。其他一些商店还提供干货、蜡烛、灯笼、马鞍、绳子和马车车轮。",
	"It can't be stressed enough that while the Harpells have little interest in the daily running of Longsaddle, it is undeniably their town. They rarely suffer insults, and never tolerate violence against themselves, their family, or the locals. A conflict involving the Harpells is likely to end swiftly and bloodily, and (unless the offender is convincingly apologetic, unconscious, dead, or forgiven of the wrongdoing) will often draw additional Harpells to support their kin. Harpell supports Harpell in all public matters, and no one bothers to record the numbers and names of those that forgot that fact.": "怎么强调都不为过的是，虽然哈珀尔家族对龙须沟的日常运作兴趣不大，但不可否认的是，这是他们的城镇。他们很少受到侮辱，也从不容忍针对他们自己、他们的家人或当地人的暴力。涉及哈佩尔人的冲突很可能迅速而血腥地结束，而且（除非犯罪者令人信服地道歉、昏迷、死亡或被原谅了错误行为）往往会吸引更多的哈佩尔人来支持他们的亲属。哈珀尔在所有公共事务中都支持哈珀尔，没有人愿意记录那些忘记这一事实的人数和名字。",
	"Aside from the Harpells, the dominant families of Longsaddle are ranchers: the Cadrasz, Emmert, Kromlor, Mammlar, Sharnshield, Suldivver, and Zelorrgosz families have ranched in or near Longsaddle for generations, and influence most of the daily life there. They set the market days, help resolve disputes among families, and broker purchases when a farmer or businessperson dies without an heir. They settle smaller matters and keep the peace as best they can, knowing full well that if the Harpells need to get involved in a dispute, there is always the possibility of an offender's being blasted into nothingness.": "除了哈佩尔家族之外，龙萨德的主要家族都是牧场主：卡德拉斯兹、埃默特、克罗姆勒、马姆拉、沙恩斯盾、苏尔迪弗和泽罗尔戈斯家族世代在龙萨德或附近从事牧场经营，并影响着那里大部分的日常生活。他们确定集市日，帮助解决家庭之间的纠纷，并在农民或商人死后没有继承人的情况下充当购买的中介。他们尽可能地解决小事并维持和平，他们清楚地知道，如果哈珀尔家族需要介入争端，总有可能将犯罪者炸成一片虚无。",
	"These families are also the ones most likely to hire outsiders to deal with matters on the ranches, whether an orc raid or the appearance of lycanthropes in the area (though it's rumored that the latter creatures may be the descendants of one of the Harpells). The major ranching interests often hire adventurers not only to further their own aims or provide for defense, but to secretly hinder or harm one another and gain an advantage in their ongoing competition. Adventurers that go too far on such a mission can be explained away as foolish outlanders, and if they offend a Harpell and get blasted in the middle of the Low Road, there will be no one left to ask about the matter. My best advice is to be mindful of the scent of magic in the air and act accordingly.": "这些家族也是最有可能雇佣外人来处理牧场事务的家族，无论是兽人的突袭还是该地区出现的狼人（尽管有传言说后一种生物可能是哈珀尔家族的后代）。主要的牧场利益集团经常雇用冒险者，不仅是为了促进他们自己的目标或提供防御，而且是为了秘密地阻碍或伤害对方，在他们正在进行的竞争中获得优势。在这种任务中走得太远的冒险者可以被解释为愚蠢的外乡人，如果他们得罪了哈佩尔，在低级道路中间被炸死，就没有人可以询问此事了。我最好的建议是注意空气中的魔法气味并采取相应的行动。",
	"Mirabar is a human city that rests atop dwarven caverns. On the surface, humans dominate the population, with some dwarves mixed in, and a handful of gnomes and halflings. The uppermost level of the undercity is mostly dwarves, with some few humans. The mixing of races is due to convenience of trade, preference, or skill; just as some few humans like to mine, to imbibe strong dwarven drink, and to work underground, so do a minority of dwarves take to the open sky, doing dock work, or even manning and building ships. The lower levels beneath Mirabar are all dwarven, as even the most dwarf-like human can live so deep below ground for only so long. Almost all of its citizens, regardless of race, honor Moradin and the dwarven gods, making Mirabar a dwarven city in spirit and ethics, if not entirely by population, much in the way my own Silverymoon speaks to elven ideals of natural beauty.": "米拉巴尔是一座人类城市，坐落在矮人的洞穴之上。在表面上，人类占主导地位，一些矮人混杂其中，还有少数地精和半身人。城下的最上层主要是矮人，还有一些少数人类。种族的混合是由于贸易的便利、偏好或技能；就像一些少数人类喜欢采矿、喝浓烈的矮人饮料和在地下工作一样，少数矮人也喜欢在空旷的天空下，从事码头工作，甚至是操纵和建造船只。米拉巴尔地下的低层都是矮人，因为即使是最像矮人的人类也只能在地下深处生活这么久。几乎所有的市民，不论种族，都尊敬莫拉丁和矮人之神，使米拉巴尔在精神和道德上成为一个矮人城市，如果不完全是人口的话，就像我自己的银月城对自然美景的理想一样。",
	"Long ago, the great dwarven kingdom of Gharraghaur stood to the west of Delzoun, delving mines near the River Mirar and finding great, near-endless veins of gems. Like many of the dwarven realms, Gharraghaur fell to marauding orcs, which destroyed the kingdom and its capital city but couldn't take advantage of the wealth therein. For millennia the lower city lay empty, until some eight hundred years ago, when Prince Ereskas of Amn settled the same spot, creating the city of Mirabar (coincidentally echoing the dwarven \"-bar\" naming convention used for citadels throughout the North). It was only when dwarves returned to work the mines below that Mirabar began to see its fortunes increase.": "很久以前，伟大的矮人王国Gharraghaur矗立在Delzoun的西部，在Mirar河附近挖掘矿藏，发现了巨大的、近乎无尽的宝石矿脉。就像许多矮人王国一样，加拉豪尔落入了掠夺性的兽人手中，他们摧毁了王国和首都，却无法利用其中的财富。几千年来，下层城市一直空荡荡的，直到大约八百年前，安恩的王子埃瑞斯卡斯在同一地点定居，建立了米拉巴尔城（巧合的是，这与整个北方的矮人\"-巴 \"的命名惯例相呼应）。只有当矮人回到下面的矿场工作时，米拉巴尔才开始看到它的财富增长。",
	"Mirabar is ruled by its hereditary marchion, Selin Raurym, who issues edicts fed to him by the Council of Sparkling Stones. The council is a group of dwarves and some few humans elected to make policy for the city, who determine where the output of Mirabar's mines will be sold. Although the council has long kept Mirabar associated with the Lords' Alliance, it is the marchion who negotiates with his fellow lords. Thus far, Selin Raurym has proved far more capable than his predecessors at making beneficial decisions for the city, and the council has given him great leeway to speak for Mirabar outside the walls. His threat to pull out of the Alliance following its failure to aid the northern cities against the most recent orc hordes, though considered by some an empty gesture, has brought Mirabar more advantageous relationships with Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate, something which has not gone unappreciated by the council.": "米拉巴尔由其世袭酋长塞林-劳瑞姆（Selin Raurym）统治，他发布由闪光石议会提供给他的法令。议会是由矮人和少数人类组成的团体，他们被选举出来为城市制定政策，决定米拉巴尔的矿场的产出将被卖到哪里。虽然理事会长期以来一直让米拉巴尔与领主联盟保持联系，但与领主同伴谈判的是马奇恩。到目前为止，塞林-劳瑞姆已经证明在为城市做出有益的决定方面比他的前任要强得多，议会也给了他很大的余地在城墙外为米拉巴尔说话。在联盟未能帮助北方城市对抗最近的兽人群之后，他威胁要退出联盟，虽然有些人认为这是一个空洞的姿态，但却为米拉巴尔带来了与水底城和博德之门更有利的关系，这一点并没有得到议会的赞赏。",
	"The city's guard, the Axe of Mirabar, exists primarily to deter and prevent sabotage of the mines, without which Mirabar would collapse. The guard also provides swift and capable defense and law enforcement within the city. The wealth of Mirabar is so great that it maintains docks, ships, and fortified harbors on many of the islands in the Sea of Swords, and as such the city is always seeking magical and military support for these defenses. Where other cities might use such vast mountains of coin as Mirabar possesses on shows of prosperity, Mirabarrens use it for more functional goals, making sure that the city's defenses are new, that its gates close securely when they are moved, that its buildings and walls are strong and secure. Given the recent destruction of Sundabar's surface city at the hand of orc armies, such expenditures are well justified, since no one in Mirabar wishes to see the surface city wiped out. It would simply be bad for business. Mirabar spares no expense in defending its wealth, and hires as many mages and adventurers as necessary to clear threats away from roads, investigate sabotage, and otherwise protect its vital trade.": "城市的卫队，米拉巴尔之斧，主要是为了阻止和防止对矿场的破坏，没有它，米拉巴尔将崩溃。警卫队还在城市内提供迅速而有力的防御和执法。米拉巴尔的财富是如此之大，以至于它在剑海的许多岛屿上都有码头、船只和坚固的港口，因此，该城市一直在为这些防御措施寻求魔法和军事支持。其他城市可能会将米拉巴尔拥有的如此庞大的硬币山用于显示繁荣，而米拉巴尔人则将其用于更多的功能目标，确保城市的防御系统是新的，其大门在移动时能安全地关闭，其建筑和墙壁是坚固和安全的。鉴于桑达巴尔的地面城市最近被兽人军队摧毁，这种支出是合理的，因为米拉巴尔没有人希望看到地面城市被消灭。这对商业来说是很不利的。米拉巴尔不遗余力地捍卫自己的财富，并在必要时雇佣尽可能多的法师和冒险家来清除道路上的威胁，调查破坏行为，并以其他方式保护其重要贸易。",
	"With the rise of Mithral Hall in the last century, and now Gauntlgrym, Mirabar fears its place as the armory of the North is at risk. The miners, smelters, and smiths of Mirabar work ever harder to increase their output and improve their craft, while the jewelers and enamelers study ways to incorporate ancient techniques of melding dwarven, human, and elven designs together in their work, in the manner of old Phalorm.": "随着Mithral Hall在上个世纪的崛起，以及现在Gauntlgrym的出现，Mirabar担心它作为北方军械库的地位会受到威胁。米拉巴尔的矿工、冶炼师和铁匠们更加努力地工作，以提高他们的产量和改进他们的工艺，而珠宝商和珐琅师则研究如何在他们的作品中融入古老的技术，将矮人、人类和精灵的设计融合在一起，就像古老的法隆一样。",
	"Mirabarren (or to some, just Mierren) dwarves like to cultivate long, wide (as opposed to tapered or pointed) beards and tight braids of hair growing elsewhere than on the chin, a fashion copied by some local humans. They love polished, everbright-treated sheets of metal, particularly copper, used as doors or mirrorlike wallpanel inlays. They often set gems into the pommels and nonworking ends of tools and weapons. Mierren dwarves tend to be wealthy, to have personal collections of unusual and rare gems, to use seals made of gems carved into signet rings, and to be investors in ventures (rather than property) up and down the Sword Coast. They are sophisticated and worldly, and they decry the isolationist and xenophobic attitudes of some dwarves. Mierren dwarves demonstrate their own broader attitudes by being the diplomatic traders and power brokers in trademoots and agreements in Fireshear and Neverwinter and everywhere else they can worm their way into, among dwarves and between dwarves and non-dwarves.": "米拉巴伦（或对一些人来说，只是米尔伦）矮人喜欢培养长而宽（而不是锥形或尖形）的胡须，以及在下巴以外的其他地方生长的紧身辫子，这种时尚被一些当地人类所模仿。他们喜欢抛光的、经过常亮处理的金属片，特别是铜片，用作门或镜子般的墙板镶嵌。他们经常在工具和武器的鞍座和非工作端镶嵌宝石。米尔伦矮人往往很富有，拥有不寻常的稀有宝石的个人收藏，使用宝石雕刻成的印记，并且是剑海岸上下的企业（而不是财产）的投资者。他们成熟而世故，他们谴责某些矮人的孤立主义和排外主义态度。米尔伦矮人通过在火星和永夜以及其他任何他们能够以蠕虫方式进入的地方，在矮人之间以及矮人和非矮人之间成为商标和协议的外交商人和权力经纪人，来证明他们自己更广泛的态度。",
	"To other dwarves, Mierren are translators and local guides and \"the people who know the right people\" in human-dominated cities everywhere along the Sword Coast and in much of the Heartlands. Most adult Mierren have dealings with a variety of human costers and merchants, taking care to avoid exclusivity or cultivate too narrow a range of business partners and contacts, so they control their own destinies and fortunes. They abhor the thought of humans having the slightest chance of dominating them.": "对于其他矮人来说，米伦是翻译和当地向导，以及在剑海岸和心脏地带大部分地区的人类主导的城市中 \"认识正确的人 \"的人。大多数成年的米伦人都与各种人类造价师和商人打交道，注意避免排他性或培养范围过窄的商业伙伴和联系人，因此他们控制着自己的命运和财富。他们憎恨人类有丝毫支配他们的机会的想法。",
	"The wealth that flows through Mirabar has not only extended the reach and worldly knowledge of all Mierren, it has enabled them to indulge all sorts of personal hobbies, such as art collections (statuettes and paintings in particular). The private living quarters of most Mierren feature comfortable furniture, painted artwork large and small, statuary, and hanging chimes—often metallic, but always soft and pleasant, never loud or strident. Gems are plentiful in Mierren families and are used as currency and in all manner of personal adornment, rather than being hidden away. Semiprecious stones line many of the streets in Mirabar, and gorgeous inlays mark important corners and intersections, some so new that one can still smell the jeweler's dust.": "流经米拉巴尔的财富不仅扩大了所有米勒人的影响力和世俗知识，还使他们能够沉迷于各种个人爱好，如艺术收藏（尤其是雕像和绘画）。大多数米伦人的私人生活区都有舒适的家具、大大小小的绘画艺术品、雕像和悬挂的风铃--通常是金属的，但总是柔和宜人，从不喧哗或刺耳。宝石在米尔伦家庭中非常多，被用作货币和各种个人装饰品，而不是被藏起来。米拉巴尔的许多街道上都有半宝石，华丽的镶嵌物标志着重要的角落和交叉口，有些是如此新，以至于人们还能闻到珠宝商的灰尘。",
	"Still, despite the city's overall wealth, there are rich and (relatively) poor Mirabarrans. Not everyone shares in the coin the city's sales bring in, and wage workers whose income is determined by a day's labor or a month's output can't hope to expect that a well-worded contract by an employer will enrich them in the least. Wealthy merchants and business owners are careful not to show their success ostentatiously; their clothing might be of richer fabrics, but still in the same styles and colors as the garb of poorer folks. Waiting rooms and front halls in the fortified homes of the rich are just as sparsely furnished as those in poorer homes. Keeping up the appearance of relative equality in fortunes is vital, for if anyone in a position to commit a violent act—say, a weaponsmith with access to great stores of swords and axes—knew just how wealthy the wealthiest Mirabarrans were, there would very likely be bloodshed before the offended parties were satisfied.": "然而，尽管这个城市总体上很富裕，但还是有富裕的和（相对）贫穷的米拉巴兰人。不是每个人都能分享城市销售带来的钱财，那些收入由一天的劳动或一个月的产出决定的工薪族，不能指望雇主的一份措辞得当的合同能使他们获得丝毫的财富。富裕的商人和企业主都小心翼翼地避免炫耀他们的成功；他们的衣服可能是更丰富的面料，但仍然是与穷人的服装一样的款式和颜色。富人家的候车室和前厅与穷人家的候车室和前厅一样，都是家具稀少的。保持财富相对平等的外观是至关重要的，因为如果任何有能力实施暴力行为的人--例如，能够获得大量剑和斧头的武器制造商--知道最富有的米拉巴兰人是多么富有，在被冒犯的各方得到满足之前，很可能会发生流血事件。",
	"The dwarves were the first to discover the secret of treating their metal with everbright. The technique has been imitated by other races, to varying degrees of success. Armor, weapons, and other metal objects to which everbright is applied maintain their luster without needing to be polished, and are resistant to natural (and, in some cases, magical) pitting, rusting, and tarnishing.": "矮人是第一个发现用常光处理金属的秘密的人。这种技术已经被其他种族所模仿，并取得了不同程度的成功。盔甲、武器和其他金属物品在使用常亮剂后，无需抛光就能保持光泽，并能抵抗自然（以及在某些情况下，魔法）的点蚀、生锈和褪色。",
	"A short while ago, Neverwinter was beset by all manner of damage, danger, and gloom. Now, the orcs that once menaced the city have moved east to join their brethren in being crushed by the dwarves. The Chasm that rent the land has been sealed by powerful magic. The High Road has been cleared and rebuilt, and trade has resumed with Waterdeep and realms to the south. What was the blasted, wounded city of Neverwinter just a decade ago is now an exciting, humming place, where folk seem eager to throw off the hardships from which they have emerged and create a new, brighter future for their city.": "不久前，永夜城还被各种破坏、危险和阴霾所困扰。现在，曾经威胁着这座城市的兽人已经向东移动，与他们的兄弟们一起被矮人击溃。撕裂土地的鸿沟已被强大的魔法封住。高路已经被清理和重建，与水底世界和南方王国的贸易已经恢复。十年前的永夜城是一个被炸毁的、受伤的城市，现在则是一个令人兴奋的、嗡嗡作响的地方，那里的人们似乎渴望摆脱困境，为他们的城市创造一个新的、更光明的未来。",
	"Nearly half a century ago, Mount Hotenow (the nearby volcano that perpetually heats the river flowing through the city) violently erupted, destroying much of Neverwinter, killing thousands, and leaving in its wake a great, gaping chasm that split the city. Neverwinter was in ruins, and external influences—from Netheril to Thay to Lord Dagult Neverember of Waterdeep to the agents of the Hells themselves—sought to exert control over the city. Many folk fought to stem all these dangers, and eventually, a measure of peace fell over Neverwinter.": "近半个世纪前，霍特诺山（附近的火山，永远加热着流经城市的河流）猛烈爆发，摧毁了永夜城的大部分地区，杀死了数千人，并在其身后留下了一条巨大的、分裂城市的鸿沟。永夜城成了一片废墟，外来的影响--从尼瑟尔到泰伊，到水底城的达古特-永夜城主，再到地狱的代理人，都想对这座城市施加控制。许多人为了阻止这些危险而战斗，最终，永夜城获得了一定程度的和平。",
	"Since Dagult Neverember was deposed as the Open Lord of Waterdeep, he has thrown his full attention and effort into the rebuilding of the city from which he claims descent. Whatever people's opinions are of his claim to Neverwinter's throne, he has proven a capable, inspiring leader over these last few years, and the population has embraced him as Lord Protector. He engineered the sealing of the Chasm and the restoration of the High Road, and is seeking other ways to repair and improve the city. Even if he can never prove his descent from Lord Nasher Alagondar, the people of Neverwinter have accepted his leadership. (My rumored personal dislike of Lord Neverember has nothing to do with my assessment of his leadership; I merely find him an intolerable flirt.)": "自从达古特-纽伦堡被废黜为沃特德普的公开领主后，他就把全部的注意力和精力都放在了重建这个他自称有血统的城市。无论人们对他在永夜的王位有什么看法，在过去的几年里，他已经被证明是一个有能力的、鼓舞人心的领导者，人们也拥护他成为保护者。他设计了鸿沟的封印和大道的恢复，并正在寻求其他方法来修复和改善城市。即使他无法证明自己是纳舍-阿拉贡达大人的后裔，永夜城的人们也接受了他的领导。(传闻中我对永夜城主的个人厌恶与我对他的领导力的评价无关，我只是觉得他是个令人无法容忍的花花公子。)",
	"Neverember's influence radiates outward from the Protector's Enclave, centered at the Hall of Justice. With Tyr restored to life and his worship returning to prominence, the Lord Protector has moved into a modest, private villa. This sacrifice—and the renewal of Tyr's faith in the previous center of his operations—is only further proof, to some, that Neverember deserves to rule Neverwinter. As yet, Castle Never remains a dangerous ruin, but Neverember has plans to reclaim and rebuild it as a symbol of the city's rejuvenation.": "Neverember的影响力从以正义殿堂为中心的保护者飞地向外辐射。随着泰尔恢复了生命，他的崇拜也恢复了显著的地位，保护者大人已经搬进了一个简陋的私人别墅。这一牺牲--以及泰尔对他以前的行动中心的重新信任--在一些人看来，这只是进一步证明了永夜城值得统治永夜城。到目前为止，永无堡仍然是一个危险的废墟，但永无堡已经计划将其收回并重建，作为城市复兴的象征。",
	"The faithful of Oghma have arrived in Neverwinter to restore the House of Knowledge to its former glory, but beyond that, shrines to all manner of gods have been cobbled together in every corner of the city.": "奥格玛的信徒们来到永夜城，将知识之家恢复到昔日的辉煌，但除此之外，在城市的每个角落都有各种神灵的神龛被拼凑起来。",
	"As the city restores itself, there are likely to be requests for ennoblement and the privileges that provides, and certainly, trading interests will emerge. But Lord Protector Neverember is sure to point out that he is merely a protector, not a king, and so can't invest or recognize anyone. Guilds may form, but it is sure to be years, if not decades, before any prove strong enough to persevere over their rivals.": "随着城市的自我恢复，很可能会有人要求封爵和提供特权，当然，贸易利益也会出现。但保护者Neverember大人肯定会指出，他只是一个保护者，而不是国王，所以不能投资或承认任何人。行会可能会形成，但肯定要经过几年，甚至几十年的时间，才能证明有足够强大的力量来战胜他们的对手。",
	"Increasingly, calls come from the citizenry for the enforcers out of Mintarn to be replaced by respectable, local guards who have a personal interest in the defense of Neverwinter. This public sentiment has led to some neighborhoods organizing their own makeshift militias, and the Lord Protector wants to avoid conflict between them and the mercenaries he has hired. As a result, Neverember has slowly been drawing down the number of soldiers from Mintarn, as the citizens that grew up defending the makeshift Wall from threats out of the Chasm prove themselves capable of becoming a proper military force. Both Baldur's Gate and Waterdeep have offered to help train the new guards of Neverwinter, but Lord Neverember prefers the assistance of seasoned adventurers to the ignominy of seeking help from his former city.": "越来越多的市民要求将执法者从敏塔恩（Mintarn）调走，由值得尊敬的、对保卫永冬有个人兴趣的当地卫兵取代。这种公众情绪导致一些社区组织了自己的临时民兵，而保护者大人希望避免他们与他所雇佣的雇佣兵之间发生冲突。因此，纽伦堡一直在慢慢减少来自敏塔恩的士兵数量，因为那些在保护临时长城免受鸿沟威胁中长大的公民证明自己有能力成为一支合适的军事力量。博德之门（Baldur's Gate）和沃特德普（Waterdeep）都表示愿意帮助训练永夜城的新守卫，但永夜城主更喜欢经验丰富的冒险家的帮助，而不是向他以前的城市寻求帮助的耻辱。"
