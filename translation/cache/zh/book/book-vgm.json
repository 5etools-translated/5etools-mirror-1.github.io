	"Volo has encountered many monsters in his day, few as odious or as ornery as the ones described herein. This chapter takes several iconic D&D monsters and provides additional information about their origins, their dispositions and behaviors, and their lairs-above and beyond what is written in the {@i Monster Manual.} To give every monster such grand treatment would require too many pages to count, so we winnowed down the list to nine groups of creatures that have a lot going for them and tend to get used often in D&D campaigns:": "沃罗在他的日子里遇到过很多怪物，但很少有像这里描述的那样可恶或讨厌的怪物。本章选取了几个具有代表性的D&D怪物，并提供了关于它们的起源、它们的性格和行为以及它们的巢穴的额外信息--超出了{@i Monster Manual.}中所记载的内容。 如果要对每个怪物进行如此隆重的处理，将需要太多的篇幅来计算，因此我们将名单缩小到九组生物，这些生物有很多优点，往往在D&D活动中经常被使用。",

	"If you plunder this chapter for ideas and maps the next time you create an adventure or a villain, then this material has served its purpose. We hope that, as you explore each monster section, you'll come up with new ways to challenge and entertain your players, as well as find new things that you can borrow for your own D&D campaign. Let each entry spark your imagination!": "如果你在下次创建冒险或反派时，能从这一章中获得一些想法和地图，那么这份材料就达到了它的目的。我们希望，在你探索每个怪物部分时，你会想出挑战和娱乐你的玩家的新方法，以及找到可以为你自己的D&D活动借用的新东西。让每个条目激发你的想象力吧",
	"The lore in this chapter represents the perspective of Volo and is mostly limited to the Forgotten Realms. In the Realms and elsewhere in the D&D multiverse, reality is more varied than the idiosyncratic views presented here. DM, use the material that inspires you and leave the rest.": "本章中的传说代表了沃罗的观点，主要限于被遗忘的领域。在王国和D&D多元宇宙的其他地方，现实比这里介绍的特异性观点更加丰富多彩。管理员，请使用能给你带来灵感的材料，其余的就不用管了。",
	"To those who would seek to conquer beholders or merely understand them, nearly everything about their quarry is unfathomable. These bizarre creatures are possessed of alien intelligence, inhuman forms of perception, and the ability to shape reality through force of will-or even by their mere presence. Inside the comfortable confines of its subterranean lair, a beholder is nearly unassailable thanks to the combination of its peerless intellect and the brutal effects of its eye rays.": "对于那些想要征服观世音菩萨或仅仅了解他们的人来说，关于他们的猎物的几乎所有事情都是深不可测的。这些怪异的生物拥有外星智慧、非人类的感知方式，以及通过意志力塑造现实的能力，甚至是通过他们的存在。在其地下巢穴的舒适范围内，由于其无以伦比的智力和其眼睛射线的残酷效果的结合，观察者几乎是不可撼动的。",
	"Some of the behaviors and motivations that beholders exhibit are analogous to those of humans and other intelligent creatures. The difference is one of degree. For instance, where a prideful, confident human might be cowed by a serious threat, the arrogance of a beholder knows no such bounds: it believes that it is superior to every other creature, even including other beholders. A human chess player becomes a master by honing the ability to look several moves ahead during a game-which is still no match for what a beholder can accomplish with its superior intelligence and awareness.": "持有人所表现出的一些行为和动机与人类和其他智能生物的行为和动机类似。区别在于程度。例如，一个骄傲自信的人类可能会被严重的威胁所吓倒，而持证人的傲慢却没有这种界限：它相信自己比其他所有的生物都优越，甚至包括其他持证人。一个人类棋手通过磨练在游戏中展望未来几步的能力而成为大师--但这仍然无法与持像者以其卓越的智慧和意识所能完成的事情相提并论。",
	"The mind of a beholder is powerful and versatile enough that it can envision literally any possibility, and it prepares accordingly, making it virtually impossible for any invaders to catch it unawares. This way of thinking could be interpreted as a form of paranoia-and if so, it would be the most extreme form imaginable. While a human tyrant might be rightfully paranoid about unperceived threats, a beholder is paranoid even though it perceives everything, because that attitude is the natural companion to eternal vigilance.": "观察者的思想足够强大和多才多艺，它可以设想到任何可能性，并做好相应的准备，使任何入侵者几乎不可能让它措手不及。这种思维方式可以被解释为一种偏执狂，如果是这样，那将是可以想象的最极端形式。虽然一个人类暴君可能会对未察觉的威胁产生理所当然的偏执，但一个看守者即使感知到了一切，也是偏执的，因为这种态度是永恒的警惕的自然伴侣。",
	"Beholders are among the few creatures that can shape reality in their vicinity. In addition, beholders don't truly sleep when they rest. Instead, a beholder's mind remains semiconscious even as it dreams. As a result, on rare occasions when a beholder dreams of another beholder, the dream-reality becomes warped and takes on physical form, becoming another actual beholder. To call this process reproduction would be inaccurate, because in most cases the old and new beholders fight to the death-a fact for which the rest of the world is thankful.": "观察者是少数能在其附近塑造现实的生物之一。此外，观想者在休息时并不真正睡觉。相反，持心者的头脑即使在做梦时也会保持半清醒状态。因此，在极少数情况下，当一个beholder梦到另一个beholder时，梦中的现实会变得扭曲并具有物理形态，成为另一个实际的beholder。将这一过程称为复制是不准确的，因为在大多数情况下，新旧持证人会争斗到死--这也是世界上其他地方所感谢的事实。",
	"A beholder sees in all directions. It is always looking for concealed attackers. Even when it sleeps, its smaller eyes remain open, scanning its lair for threats. If a human acted this way, the constant vigilance and lack of truly peaceful rest would lead to a dangerous level of psychosis, but a beholder's mind accepts this attitude as normal and necessary-it is always alert to the possibility of assassination or betrayal by unknown threats that stand ready to pounce on the beholder the instant it lets its guard down.": "观察者能看到所有的方向。它总是在寻找隐蔽的攻击者。即使在它睡觉的时候，它的小眼睛仍然睁着，扫描它的巢穴，寻找威胁。如果人类这样做，持续的警惕和缺乏真正的平静的休息会导致危险的精神错乱，但beholder的头脑接受这种态度是正常的和必要的--它总是警惕被未知的威胁暗杀或背叛的可能性，这些威胁准备在beholder放松警惕的瞬间扑向它。",
	"Complementing this ever-present, passive paranoia is the beholder's genius-level intelligence. Where another creature would ignore the occurrence of two seemingly unrelated events as merely coincidental, a beholder imagines multiple ways they could be related, finding or fabricating a pattern out of supposed or actual randomness. By thinking of all these possibilities-however implausible they might be-and extrapolating its own actions in response, a beholder is truly prepared for any situation and has a strategy to counteract it.": "与这种永远存在的、被动的偏执相辅相成的是看客的天才级智慧。其他生物会忽视两个看似不相关的事件的发生，认为这只是巧合，而看客会想象它们之间可能存在的多种关系，从假定或实际的随机性中找到或编造一种模式。通过思考所有这些可能性--无论这些可能性多么不可思议--并推断出自己的行动来应对，beholder对任何情况都有真正的准备，并有应对的策略。",
	"A beholder has plans on top of plans, even for the least likely circumstances. It doesn't matter if invading adventurers arrive at its lair with summoned angel allies or enslaved demons, by breaking through the floor, by teleporting or riding dinosaurs, or girded with layers of magical defenses and armed with advanced weapons. In any case, the beholder's reaction is calculated, because it has thought about what it and its minions must do in response to every situation.": "看守者在计划之上还有计划，甚至对最不可能发生的情况也有计划。如果入侵的冒险者带着被召唤的天使盟友或被奴役的恶魔来到它的巢穴，通过破门而入，通过传送或骑着恐龙，或者带着层层的魔法防御和先进的武器武装，这都不重要。在任何情况下，看守者的反应都是经过计算的，因为它已经想好了它和它的爪牙必须对每一种情况做出的反应。",
	"A beholder believes it is superior to all other entities. Unintelligent foes are regarded as food or pets. An intelligent creature is seen as food or a potential minion. A beholder's true rivals are other beholders, for only another beholder has the intellect, power, and magic to threaten another of its kind.": "观察者认为自己比其他所有实体都要优越。没有智慧的敌人被看作是食物或宠物。聪明的生物则被视为食物或潜在的奴才。一个持有者的真正对手是其他持有者，因为只有另一个持有者才有智力、力量和魔法来威胁另一个同类。",
	"Most of a beholder's mental activity is devoted to unearthing plots against itself (real or imaginary), planning attacks against known rivals, and preparing its defenses against all possible threats. It considers itself the center of the world, in a narcissistic way; of course the clan of duergar moving into its territory is because a rival is trying to oust it, of course the gang of adventurers in its lair were sent to kill it by a cowardly rival, and so on, because it is the perfect example of beholderness and all other creatures are jealous.": "一个beholder的大部分精神活动都是用来发掘针对自己的阴谋（真实的或想象的），计划对已知对手的攻击，并准备好防御所有可能的威胁。它认为自己是世界的中心，以一种自恋的方式；当然，迁入它领地的duergar氏族是因为对手要赶走它，当然，它巢穴里的那帮冒险者是由一个懦弱的对手派来杀它的，等等，因为它是beholderness的完美典范，所有其他生物都嫉妒。",
	"A beholder's arrogance is a prominent aspect of its personality. Although it isn't inclined to brag of its superiority, especially in combat, it is dismissive of its opponents' efforts and insulting of their abilities and failures. An exceptional challenger can earn a measure of respect-enough that the beholder might be merciful and pacify the creature with a charm ray or a sleep ray instead of killing it outright. Of course, this mercy has a purpose; the defeated opponent is interrogated, subjugated, and offered a role in the beholder's retinue once its will is broken. A beholder might consider a group of skilled adventurers to be a valuable prize and use its abilities to capture them all for this purpose, giving them the opportunity to serve as guards, spies, or assassins against a rival. Refusal means, at best, servitude as a charmed minion, and at worst, disintegration.": "看守者的傲慢是其个性的一个突出方面。虽然它并不倾向于吹嘘自己的优势，尤其是在战斗中，但它对对手的努力不屑一顾，对他们的能力和失败也是嗤之以鼻。一个出色的挑战者可以赢得一定程度的尊重，以至于看守者可能会手下留情，用魅力射线或睡眠射线来安抚这个生物，而不是直接杀死它。当然，这种仁慈是有目的的；被打败的对手会被审问，被征服，一旦它的意志被击垮，就会在看守者的随从中得到一个角色。看守者可能会认为一群熟练的冒险者是有价值的战利品，并为此利用其能力将他们全部捕获，让他们有机会充当卫兵、间谍或刺客来对付对手。拒绝意味着，在最好的情况下，作为一个被魅惑的奴仆，在最坏的情况下，解体。",
	"Beholders can produce others of their own kind, but the process has nothing to do with biology and everything to do with psychology.": "持有人可以产生自己的同类，但这个过程与生物学无关，与心理学有关。",
	"When a beholder sleeps, its body goes briefly dormant but its mind never stops working. The creature is fully aware, even though to an outside observer it might appear oblivious of its surroundings.": "当一个观察者睡觉时，它的身体会短暂地休眠，但它的头脑从未停止工作。这种生物是完全有意识的，尽管在外部观察者看来它可能对周围的环境视而不见。",
	"Sometimes a beholder's dreams are dominated by images of itself or of other beholders (which might or might not actually exist).": "有时，观察者的梦境被自己或其他观察者（可能存在也可能不存在）的形象所支配。",
	"On extremely rare occasions when a beholder dreams of another beholder, the act creates a warp in reality-from which a new, fully formed beholder springs forth unbidden, seemingly having appeared out of thin air in a nearby space. This \"offspring\" might be a duplicate of the beholder that dreamed it into existence, or it could take the form of a different variety of beholder, such as a death kiss or a gazer (see \"Beholder-Kin\"). It might also be a truly unique creature, such as could be spawned only from the twisted imagination of a beholder, with a set of magical abilities unlike that of its parent. In most cases, the process yields one of the three principal forms of the beholder: a solitary beholder, a hive, or a death tyrant.": "在极其罕见的情况下，当一个beholder梦到另一个beholder时，这种行为会在现实中产生一个扭曲--一个新的、完全形成的beholder会不由自主地涌现出来，似乎是在附近的空间中凭空出现的。这个 \"后代 \"可能是梦到它存在的那个Beholder的复制品，也可能采取不同种类的Beholder的形式，比如死亡之吻或凝视者（见 \"Beholder-Kin\"）。它也可能是一个真正独特的生物，比如只能从一个观想者扭曲的想象力中产生，拥有一套不同于其父母的魔法能力。在大多数情况下，这个过程会产生三种主要形式的看守者之一：一个单独的看守者，一个蜂巢，或者一个死亡暴君。",
	"Most of the beholders in the world live apart from others of their kind, and they like it that way. When a solitary beholder dreams another beholder into existence, the creatures' basic nature often means that the first thing they do is try to destroy one another. A solitary beholder lairs within a cave system or a ruined structure, either one of its own making or a place the creature took over after killing or driving off the beholder that gave it birth.": "世界上的大多数持币人都与其他同类分开生活，他们喜欢这种方式。当一个孤独的Beholder梦到另一个Beholder存在时，这些生物的基本性质往往意味着它们做的第一件事就是试图摧毁对方。一个孤独的beholder会在一个洞穴系统或一个废墟结构中藏身，要么是它自己制造的，要么是该生物在杀死或赶走让它出生的beholder之后占领的地方。",
	"A solitary beholder gathers (or inherits) inferior creatures that it uses as minions. These creatures help defend the lair and also serve as shock troops if the beholder vacates its lair to prey on the inhabitants of the surrounding area. Often, it plunders its neighbors' homes for knowledge and treasure. After the beholder secures the spoils it desires from its enemies, it allows its minions to divide the remaining booty.": "孤独的兽人收集（或继承）低等生物，并将其作为爪牙使用。这些生物帮助保卫巢穴，并且在兽人离开巢穴去掠夺周围地区的居民时充当冲击部队。通常情况下，它为了获取知识和财宝而掠夺其邻居的家园。当它从敌人那里获得它想要的战利品后，它允许它的爪牙瓜分剩余的战利品。",
	"An eye tyrant is a solitary beholder that has suppressed its xenophobia and paranoia and chooses to live as the leader or ruler of a community or an organization that includes other creatures. This doesn't mean that the eye tyrant likes, respects, or understands the creatures it chooses to associate with, but it does distinguish between individuals of other races and communicates with them on a regular basis. An eye tyrant is still ruthless at eliminating threats to itself, whether from another beholder or some other powerful creature-it just doesn't have an insane fear that any creature not under its direct control is working for an enemy. Most known beholders who choose to interact with humanoid society in any way are eye tyrants. For an example of an eye tyrant that leads an organization of humanoids, see the section on the Xanathar Guild.": "眼球暴君是一个独居的beholder，它压制了自己的仇外心理和偏执狂，选择作为一个社区或组织的领导者或统治者生活，其中包括其他生物。这并不意味着眼球暴君喜欢、尊重或理解它选择与之交往的生物，但它确实区分了其他种族的个体，并定期与他们交流。一个眼球暴君在消除对自己的威胁方面仍然是无情的，无论是来自另一个beholder还是其他强大的生物--它只是没有一种疯狂的恐惧，即任何不在它直接控制之下的生物都是为敌人工作。大多数已知的选择以任何方式与类人社会互动的beholder都是眼球暴君。关于一个领导人形生物组织的眼球暴君的例子，请参见Xanathar公会的部分。",
	"In exceedingly rare cases, a beholder might experience a dream in which it sees itself in a mirror, or encounters several copies of itself, or imagines a sensation akin to what humanoids call multiple personalities. At such a time, the beholder's dream-birthing creates a beholder hive-a group of \"newborns\" that are identical to its own shape but smaller.": "在极其罕见的情况下，持证人可能会经历一个梦，在梦中看到镜子中的自己，或遇到自己的几个副本，或想象一种类似于人类称之为多重人格的感觉。在这种情况下，观察者的梦境孕育出一个观察者蜂巢--一群与自己的形状相同但更小的 \"新生儿\"。",
	"When the dreamer awakens, it treats the newborns as extensions of its own self in other bodies, and therefore isn't consumed with an urge to kill them. This united group of identical beholders doesn't truly have a hive intelligence, but their personalities and goals are so similar that they can predict and assume each others' behavior, much as especially close human siblings can. The original beholder is usually the dominant one and takes a leadership role. A hive consists of three to ten beholders, plus whatever minions they control.": "当梦者醒来时，它把新生儿当作自己在其他身体中的延伸，因此不会被杀死他们的冲动所吞噬。这个由相同的持梦者组成的联合团体并不真正拥有蜂巢式的智慧，但他们的个性和目标是如此相似，以至于他们可以预测和假设对方的行为，就像特别亲密的人类兄弟姐妹一样。最初的蜂王通常是主导者，并发挥领导作用。一个蜂巢由三到十个蜂主组成，加上他们控制的任何爪牙。",
	"As a beholder ages, it spends more and more time worrying about its mortality. The dreams of such a death-fearing beholder might reach into strange corners of reality and imagine circumstances in which the creature can live on after death. When the beholder awakens, it finds itself transformed into a death tyrant. It now exists in a state of undeath-yet its fear of being killed remains unabated.": "随着观音的衰老，它花越来越多的时间来担心自己的死亡。这样一个惧怕死亡的看守者的梦境可能会深入到现实的奇怪角落，并想象生物在死后可以继续生存的情况。当看客醒来时，它发现自己变成了一个死亡暴君。它现在存在于一种不死的状态--然而它对被杀的恐惧仍然没有减弱。",
	"A death tyrant's paranoia about its enemies tends to be related to how it fears it will be destroyed, and its plans take that fear into account. For example, a death tyrant who imagined it would eventually be slain by frost giants might relocate its lair to the inside of a volcano, send its minions to hunt down all frost giants within 100 miles, or take some other drastic measure to ensure that the fear never becomes reality.": "一个死亡暴君对敌人的偏执往往与它担心自己会被摧毁有关，它的计划也考虑到了这种恐惧。例如，一个死亡暴君如果想象自己最终会被冰霜巨人杀死，可能会把巢穴迁到火山内部，派它的爪牙去追杀100英里内的所有冰霜巨人，或者采取一些其他严厉的措施来确保这种恐惧永远不会成为现实。",
	"The lesser creatures known as beholder-kin bear a superficial resemblance to true beholders in that each has a floating spherical body with eyes. That's where the similarity ends.": "被称为beholder-kin的较小的生物与真正的beholder有表面上的相似之处，即每个人都有一个带眼睛的漂浮的球形身体。这就是相似之处的结束。",
	"Chapter 3 of this book introduces several new types of beholder-kin. A {@b death kiss} is usually the result of a nightmare about blood, such as what a beholder might experience after an encounter with a vampire or after being severely wounded in battle. {@b Gazers} are \"born\" out of a poisoned or ill beholder's feverish dreams, in which its sense of perspective and scale is warped. A {@b spectator} (see the {@i Monster Manual)} is a kind of lesser beholder summoned from another plane of existence to watch over something, such as a treasure hoard. A {@b gauth} hails from the same plane as spectators, or one that overlaps it enough that they can take advantage of a flawed attempt to summon a spectator. Although true beholders can be found on a spectator's or gauth's home plane, the creatures' actual place of origin is unknown (whether another plane, a world beyond the stars, or some stranger location), and spectators and gauths aren't believed to originate from dreams as other beholders do.": "本书第三章介绍了几种新类型的beholder-kin。{@b death kiss}通常是关于血的恶梦的结果，比如说，在遇到吸血鬼或在战斗中受重伤后，beholder可能会经历这样的噩梦。{@b Gazers}是由中毒或生病的人在发烧的梦中 \"出生 \"的，在梦中，他们的视角和尺度被扭曲了。{@b spectator}（见{@i Monster Manual)}）是一种从另一个存在空间被召唤出来的较小的观想者，以看管一些东西，比如说一个宝藏。{@b gauth}的人来自与观察者相同的位面，或与位面有足够的重叠，他们可以利用有缺陷的召唤观察者的尝试。虽然真正的观望者可以在观望者或高斯的主位面被发现，但这些生物的实际起源地是未知的（无论是另一个位面、星际之外的世界，还是一些陌生的地方），而观望者和高斯并不像其他观望者那样被认为来自梦境。",
	"As a byproduct of their unique method of propagation, beholders in one part of the world tend to look similar, with variations becoming more pronounced the farther one travels from that area. Even a slight variation in the shape of an eyestalk or the texture of its skin is enough for one beholder to consider another a flawed abomination, which should be destroyed.": "作为他们独特的传播方法的副产品，世界上某一地区的人往往看起来很相似，离那个地区越远，变化就越明显。即使是眼柄的形状或皮肤的质地有轻微的变化，也足以让一个人认为另一个人是有缺陷的可憎之物，应该被摧毁。",

	"A beholder's natural ability to fly is essential to many of its defenses and habits. Portions of its lair-especially the remote part where it sleeps-usually aren't reachable on foot, which makes it harder for its minions to take over the lair, and forces intruders to find ways to overcome steep vertical climbs.": "Beholder的自然飞行能力对于它的许多防御和习惯都是至关重要的。它的巢穴的一部分--特别是它睡觉的偏远地区--通常是无法步行到达的，这使得它的爪牙更难接管巢穴，并迫使入侵者想办法克服陡峭的垂直爬升。",
	"Also, a beholder's natural levitation means it doesn't risk activating any floor-based traps, and therefore it is likely to use such defenses to protect its inner sanctum, allowing it to roam freely through the area while hostiles must dodge or overcome multiple obstacles.": "另外，看守者的自然漂浮意味着它不会冒险激活任何基于地板的陷阱，因此它很可能使用这种防御措施来保护它的内部圣地，允许它在该地区自由漫游，而敌人必须躲避或克服多种障碍。",

	"Even intruders who don't need light to see have to contend with the beholder's superior senses-the monster can see its opponents before 60-foot darkvision sees it.": "即使是那些不需要灯光就能看到的入侵者，也不得不与看客的超强感官抗衡--怪物可以在60英尺的暗视仪看到它之前看到它的对手。",
	"Although a beholder can't use its rays on targets inside the area of its antimagic cone, the ability of its central eye is incredibly effective in combat-instantly crippling enemy spellcasters, revealing the exact location of anyone using blur or invisibility, and causing opponents using magical flight to plummet to the ground. The cone is wide enough that the beholder can usually redirect it toward any particular creature trying to escape the area, keeping that target locked down until the monster has killed all the enemies outside the cone.": "虽然看守者不能对其反魔法锥体范围内的目标使用射线，但其中央眼睛的能力在战斗中是非常有效的--立即削弱敌人的施法者，揭示任何使用模糊或隐身的人的确切位置，并使使用魔法飞行的对手坠落到地面。这个圆锥体足够宽，持证人通常可以将它转向任何试图逃离该区域的特定生物，将该目标锁定，直到该怪物杀死圆锥体外的所有敌人。",
	"A beholder can use its telekinesis ray in conjunction with its antimagic cone to lift a heavy object above the cone and drop it onto an opponent inside the cone; gravity finishes the job, even though the cone negates the beholder's telekinetic control.": "看守者可以用它的心灵感应射线和它的反魔法圆锥体结合起来，把一个重物举到圆锥体上方，然后把它扔到圆锥体内的对手身上；尽管圆锥体否定了看守者的心灵感应控制，但重力完成了这项工作。",
	"The ability to temporarily suspend magical effects is useful to a beholder for determining if a minion has been charmed or compelled to act against its master; the creature might change its behavior when inside the cone, or it might remember or be able to speak of things it was compelled to forget or keep secret.": "暂时中止魔法效果的能力对观察者来说是很有用的，它可以确定一个奴仆是否被迷住了，或者被强迫对它的主人采取行动；这个生物在圆锥体内时可能会改变它的行为，或者它可能记得或者能够说出它被强迫忘记或保密的事情。",
	"Because the cone suppresses ongoing magical effects, the beholder might create a secure area in its lair behind a permanent wall of fire or wall of force, make use of an existing magical hazard (such as a pool that transforms any creature that touches it), or an area with magical guardians (such as an old shrine with a demon bound to it) that it can bypass.": "因为圆锥体抑制了正在进行的魔法效果，所以看守者可能会在它的巢穴中创造一个安全的区域，在永久的火墙或力墙后面，利用现有的魔法危险（比如一个可以改变任何触及它的生物的水池），或者一个有魔法守护者的区域（比如一个被恶魔束缚的古老神殿），它可以绕过这个区域。",
	"A beholder can fire multiple eye rays on its turn, and it might use all of them in succession on its most dangerous foe. Even a very tough fighter is going to have second thoughts after taking damage from a disintegration ray, an enervation ray, and a death ray.": "一个看守者可以在它的回合中发射多条眼睛射线，而且它可能对它最危险的敌人连续使用所有这些射线。即使是一个非常顽强的战士，在受到瓦解射线、保存射线和死亡射线的伤害后，也会有第二个想法。",
	"A beholder can shift its targets after its first or second rays. For example, if a beholder intends to shoot charm, slowing, and sleep rays at a ranger, and the ranger succumbs to the charm, the beholder could use its remaining rays against other targets.": "看守者可以在其第一或第二道射线之后转移目标。例如，如果一个持有者打算向一个游侠发射魅惑、减速和睡眠射线，而游侠屈服于魅惑，那么持有者可以用剩余的射线来对付其他目标。",
	"The beholder's ability to use legendary actions effectively doubles the number of times it can shoot rays in a round. Each legendary action a beholder takes gives it an opportunity to react to a change in circumstances, or to press an assault that it began on its turn. For instance, it might use its sleep ray as a legendary action against an enemy that has just been awakened. If no such opportunity presents itself, legendary actions are always useful for piling rays on the most dangerous foe.": "看守者使用传奇行动的能力有效地使它在一个回合中可以射出射线的次数加倍。持枪者采取的每一个传奇行动都使它有机会对环境的变化做出反应，或在它的回合中开始攻击。例如，它可以用它的睡眠射线作为传奇行动来对付刚刚被唤醒的敌人。如果没有这样的机会，传奇行动对于将射线堆积在最危险的敌人身上总是有用的。",
	"A beholder in its lair has access to so many resources that it can often vanquish invaders without directly confronting them. Devious and hidden traps are liable to be lurking around every corner, and might be blatantly obvious in some places, yet no less lethal. In similar fashion, a beholder might station some of its minions in a prime spot for an ambush, or it might send forth a bunch of its servants to overrun a group of enemies that have been weakened by traps and other hazards. Every beholder has minions, and can always acquire more, so the master of the lair doesn't hesitate to send its underlings into the fray.": "在它的巢穴中，看守者可以获得如此多的资源，以至于它往往可以在不直接面对入侵者的情况下将其消灭。狡猾和隐蔽的陷阱很可能潜伏在每个角落，在某些地方可能是明目张胆的，但也不乏致命性。同样地，一个拥有者可能会把它的一些爪牙驻扎在一个最好的地方进行伏击，或者它可能会派出一群仆人去消灭一群被陷阱和其他危险所削弱的敌人。每个人都有爪牙，而且总能获得更多的爪牙，所以巢穴的主人会毫不犹豫地把它的下属派到战场上。",
	"As described in the {@i Monster Manual,} a beholder's use of its eye rays in combat is random, governed by die rolls instead of by choice. This rule is an abstraction, designed to keep the beholder's opponents unsure of what rays will be coming next (and, not incidentally, to prevent the monster from using its most lethal eye rays at every opportunity). The rule also makes the creature easier to run.": "正如{@i Monster Manual,}中所描述的那样，在战斗中，beholder对其眼睛射线的使用是随机的，由掷骰子决定，而不是由选择决定。这条规则是一个抽象的概念，目的是让看守者的对手不确定接下来会有什么射线（而且，并非偶然地，是为了防止怪物一有机会就使用它最致命的眼睛射线）。这条规则也使该生物更容易跑动。",
	"In the safety of its lair, outside the view of any would-be enemies, a beholder can use any of its eye rays whenever it wants to. Many of them serve as tools.": "在安全的巢穴中，在任何可能的敌人的视线之外，持证人可以随时使用它的任何眼射线。它们中的许多都可以作为工具。",
	"The magic-nullifying effect of a beholder's central eye has a number of possible uses outside combat, but if it's not needed, the beholder can turn it off by simply closing the eye.": "看守者中央眼睛的魔法消除效果在战斗之外有许多可能的用途，但如果不需要它，看守者可以通过简单地关闭眼睛来关闭它。",
	"Normally usable only by a death tyrant, negative energy prevents survivors of a battle from healing and animates any dead or dying creatures as zombies under the beholder's control. Because there is no limit to the number of zombies a death tyrant can animate and control, it can pack its lair so full of undead that there is little space for anyone to walk, creating a shambling barrier of cadaverous resistance against any invasion.": "通常只有死亡暴君才能使用，负能量能阻止战斗中的幸存者痊愈，并使任何死亡或濒临死亡的生物成为受其控制的僵尸。由于死亡暴君可以控制的僵尸数量没有限制，它可以把自己的巢穴塞得满满的，以至于几乎没有空间让人行走，形成一个尸骨嶙峋的屏障，抵御任何入侵。",
	"It is common for a beholder to charm a hostile monster, lure the creature to the beholder's lair, and confine it there so it can't escape under its own power. In this way, even monsters that can't be bribed or coerced can be useful to a beholder, making its lair a confusing zoo of hostile beasts.": "魅惑敌方怪物，将其引诱到魅惑者的巢穴，并将其禁锢在那里，使其无法靠自己的力量逃脱，这是一种常见的做法。这样一来，即使是那些不能被收买或胁迫的怪物也能对看守者有用，使其巢穴成为一个充满敌意的混乱动物园。",
	"Although each use of the charm effect lasts only an hour, repeated uses over time against the same target tend to wear down a creature's will, creating a docile servant.": "虽然每次使用魅惑效果只持续一个小时，但长期对同一目标反复使用，往往会消磨生物的意志，形成一个温顺的仆人。",
	"Outside combat, the paralyzing ray is most often used to restrain a fleeing minion that it doesn't want to destroy outright.": "在战斗之外，麻痹射线最常被用来克制它不想直接摧毁的逃亡的小兵。",
	"A beholder uses its fear ray to psychologically torture and interrogate a prisoner until the creature loses the will to resist.": "看守者使用其恐惧射线对囚犯进行心理折磨和审讯，直到该生物失去抵抗的意志。",
	"A beholder might use its slowing ray on an uncooperative creature as a demonstration of sorts, threatening to follow it up with more severe consequences if the creature doesn't submit to the beholder's will.": "观察者可能会对一个不合作的生物使用它的减速射线作为某种示范，威胁说如果这个生物不服从观察者的意志，就会有更严重的后果。",
	"A beholder can fine-tune its death ray or enervation ray so that it can \"zap\" the smallest of targets and deal only a small amount of damage (though usually still enough to obliterate what it touches). For example, to guard against magical spying, a beholder might use either ray to eliminate all common vermin (bats, rats, spiders, and so on) from its lair.": "看守者可以微调它的死亡射线或保留射线，以便它可以 \"斩杀 \"最小的目标，只造成少量的伤害（尽管通常仍足以抹去它所接触的东西）。例如，为了防止魔法间谍活动，持枪者可以使用这两种射线来消灭其巢穴中的所有普通害虫（蝙蝠、老鼠、蜘蛛等等）。",
	"In addition to functioning as the beholder's arms and hands for everyday tasks, the telekinetic ray is essential for building traps and other lair defenses, such as positioning the weights for a falling block trap. This ray allows a beholder to station its minions in parts of the lair that can otherwise be accessed only by climbing or flying, preventing the occupants from escaping. A beholder could also use its telekinetic ray to forcibly transport a creature immune to charm effects (such as a construct or some kinds of undead).": "除了作为看守者的手臂和手来完成日常任务外，心灵感应射线对于建造陷阱和其他巢穴防御系统是必不可少的，例如为落块陷阱定位重量。这条射线允许持有者在巢穴的某些部分驻扎其爪牙，否则只能通过攀爬或飞行进入，以防止居住者逃跑。看守者也可以用它的心灵感应射线来强行运送对魅惑效果免疫的生物（如构筑物或某些种类的不死生物）。",
	"When it parlays with other creatures, a beholder might use its sleep ray as a display of power, quickly disabling the leader and thereby persuading the rest of the group to mount no resistance. This tactic is useful primarily when the beholder intends to use the group for its own purposes, and keeping the leader alive is advantageous to those plans. This ray is also used to pacify potentially useful captives, perhaps in preparation for conditioning them with the charm or fear rays.": "当它与其他生物结盟时，持灵者可能会使用它的睡眠射线作为力量的展示，迅速使首领丧失能力，从而说服其余的群体不做抵抗。这种战术主要是在持灵者打算利用群体达到自己的目的，并且保持首领活着对这些计划有利的情况下才有用。这种射线也被用来安抚可能有用的俘虏，也许是为了准备用魅力射线或恐惧射线来调节他们。",
	"The most mundane function of the petrification ray is as a means of decorating a beholder's lair with statues. Beyond that, this ray has a multitude of uses. An unruly minion could be turned to stone, eliminating the creature as a threat and creating a permanent reminder of the price of disobeying the beholder. A beholder might use loosely scattered petrified creatures to create obstacles in an open chamber, or pack them tightly in a corridor to seal off an area, or use them as falling hazards instead of heavy blocks in order to engender fear and uncertainty among intruders.": "石化射线最平凡的功能是用雕像来装饰观察者的巢穴。除此之外，这种射线还有多种用途。一个不守规矩的奴仆可以被变成石头，消除该生物的威胁，并创造一个永久的提醒，提醒人们不服从看守人的代价。看守者可以用松散的石化生物在一个开放的密室中制造障碍，或者把它们紧紧地包在走廊里来封闭一个区域，或者把它们当作坠落的危险，而不是重物，以便在入侵者中引起恐惧和不确定性。",
	"A beholder's disintegration ray is a useful tool for excavation. The beholder can also manipulate the ray with pinpoint control, enabling it to cut and shape objects as though it were wielding a fine chisel, drill holes too small for an arrow to pass through, carve masonry blocks out of raw stone, amputate limbs, or brand creatures with burn-like scars. This ray and the telekinetic ray are the basis for a beholder's ability to shape its lair to its very specific and exacting needs, whether sculpting rooms or fabricating traps.": "观察者的瓦解射线是一种有用的挖掘工具。看守者还可以精确地操纵射线，使其能够像挥舞着一把精细的凿子一样切割和塑造物体，钻出小到箭都无法通过的孔，从原石上雕刻出砖石块，截断肢体，或者给生物烙上烧伤般的疤痕。这条射线和心灵感应射线是观察者根据其非常具体和严格的需要塑造其巢穴的能力的基础，无论是雕刻房间还是制造陷阱。",
	"When a beholder's dream-imagination runs wild, the result can be an offspring that has an unusual or unique set of abilities. Rather than the standard powers of a beholder's central eye and eyestalks, the creature has one or more variant abilities-guaranteed to surprise any enemies who thought they knew what they were getting themselves into.": "当一个看守者的梦想-想象力失控时，其结果可能是产生一个具有不寻常或独特能力的后代。这种生物并不是拥有中心眼和眼线的标准能力，而是拥有一种或多种变异能力--保证能让那些自以为是的敌人大吃一惊。",
	"This section provides several alternative spell effects for a beholder's eye. Each of these effects is designed to be of the same power level as the one it replaces, enabling you to create a custom beholder without altering the monster's challenge rating. As another option, you can switch any of the damaging eye rays in the {@i Monster Manual} to an effect with a different damage type, such as replacing the enervation ray with a combustion ray that deals fire damage instead of necrotic damage.": "本节提供了几个可供选择的 \"观察者之眼 \"的法术效果。每种效果都被设计成与它所替代的效果具有相同的威力等级，使你能够在不改变怪物的挑战等级的情况下创建一个自定义的观世音。作为另一种选择，你可以将{@i Monster Manual}中的任何一个伤害性眼球射线换成具有不同伤害类型的效果，例如用燃烧射线取代保留射线，以造成火焰伤害而不是坏死伤害。",
	"Unless otherwise indicated, an alternative ability has the same range as the eye ray it is replacing, and it affects only one creature per use (even if the ability is based on a spell that normally affects an area or multiple targets). The saving throw for an alternative ability uses the same DC and the same ability score as the spell the eye ray is based on.": "除非另有说明，替代能力的范围与它所替代的眼线相同，而且每次使用只能影响一个生物（即使该能力是基于通常影响一个区域或多个目标的咒语）。替代能力的救赎使用相同的DC和相同的能力分数，就像眼线所基于的咒语一样。",

	"The lair of a beholder is a reflection of the creature's mind-set-designed to anticipate, and thwart, any plan that would-be invaders might devise. Each of its chambers is isolated, accessible from only one or two other areas, giving the beholder control over the route that enemies must take to reach the sanctum where the owner of the place lies in wait.": "看守者的巢穴反映了该生物的心态--旨在预测并挫败潜在入侵者可能制定的任何计划。它的每一个房间都是孤立的，只能从一两个其他区域进入，让看守者控制敌人必须走的路线，以到达这里的主人所等待的圣殿。",
	"A beholder usually creates its lair in an area of natural caves, shaping the chambers with its disintegration ray. Most of the entryways and passages that it fashions to connect one chamber with another are too narrow to admit creatures larger than itself (particularly in the innermost chambers). If any large openings between adjacent caves exist naturally, the beholder constricts or seals off such openings, either by employing slave labor or by collapsing the tunnel itself.": "看守者通常会在一个天然洞穴的区域内建立自己的巢穴，用它的分解射线来塑造这些洞穴。它所塑造的连接一个洞室和另一个洞室的入口和通道大多过于狭窄，无法接纳比自己大的生物（尤其是在最里面的洞室）。如果相邻洞穴之间有任何大的开口自然存在，看守者就会通过雇佣奴隶劳工或关闭隧道本身来收缩或封闭这些开口。",
	"Regardless of its overall configuration, every beholder's lair is oriented to take full advantage of the creature's flight ability. Adjoining chambers are connected by vertical or steeply sloped tunnels that the beholder carves out of the surrounding stone, each passage barely large enough to admit the beholder's body. Enemies that are too big to traverse these smooth-walled tunnels will find it difficult to move deep into the lair and virtually impossible to confront the beholder in its sanctum.": "无论其整体配置如何，每一个beholder的巢穴的方向都是为了充分利用生物的飞行能力。相邻的房间由垂直或陡峭的隧道连接，这些隧道是由看守者在周围的石头上开凿出来的，每条通道几乎都大到足以容纳看守者的身体。体型太大，无法穿越这些光滑墙壁的隧道的敌人会发现很难深入巢穴，而且几乎不可能在圣殿中与持灵者对抗。",
	"Minions and other creatures under a beholder's control generally have their own living spaces in the lair. Because a beholder's minions are typically not able to fly, many of these chambers are connected to others by staircases or gently sloping ramps in addition to the tunnels, so the beholder can easily move its minions around as the need arises.": "仆人和其他受看守者控制的生物通常在巢穴中拥有自己的生活空间。由于看守者的爪牙通常不能飞行，因此除了隧道之外，许多这些房间都通过楼梯或缓坡坡道与其他房间相连，因此看守者可以在需要时轻松地移动其爪牙。",
	"Common rooms found in a beholder's lair are described in the sections that follow.": "在看守者的巢穴中发现的普通房间将在后面的章节中描述。",
	"The main living area that the beholder uses is filled with objects that the creature enjoys looking at, such as art, statues, and its latest spoils of victory. The floor is uneven and difficult for intruders to navigate. Minions usually guard the entrances to this chamber.": "观察者使用的主要生活区充满了该生物喜欢看的物品，如艺术品、雕像和它最新的胜利战利品。地板不平，入侵者难以驾驭。仆人们通常守卫在这个房间的入口处。",
	"A lair has several escape tunnels, each closed off inside the lair by a large boulder or a mortared stone wall. Most of these routes are blocked on both ends, preventing creatures from easily entering the lair through anywhere but the main entrance. The beholder, of course, can disintegrate these barriers to gain access to the tunnel. As with the tunnels between chambers, escape tunnels are usually a steep climb or nearly vertical to make it difficult for non-flying creatures to follow. A tunnel bends every 50 to 100 feet to prevent attackers from shooting at the beholder while it flees, but giving the monster opportunities to attack when its enemies come into view. Many escape tunnels have falling block traps or weak ceilings supported by a single pillar, which the beholder can disintegrate after it passes that point to deter pursuit.": "一个巢穴有几条逃生通道，每条通道都被一块大石头或一堵加固的石墙封闭在巢穴内。这些通道的两端大多被封死，防止生物从主入口以外的任何地方轻易进入巢穴。当然，观察者可以瓦解这些障碍物以获得进入隧道的机会。与密室之间的隧道一样，逃生隧道通常是一个陡峭的攀登，或者几乎是垂直的，以使非飞行生物难以跟随。隧道每隔50到100英尺就会有一个弯道，以防止攻击者在它逃跑时向它射击，但当它的敌人出现在视野中时，就会给怪物以攻击的机会。许多逃生隧道都有坠落的块状陷阱或由一根柱子支撑的薄弱天花板，持物者在通过该点后可以将其瓦解以阻止追击。",
	"Because a beholder's paranoia knows no limits, it often designs its lair to include secret passageways that are used for reconnaissance or surprise attacks. (These features aren't shown on the accompanying map, but can be located anywhere you see fit.) A typical arrangement is a network of tunnels running above the main chambers of the lair, each wide enough for the beholder to fly through. Fist-sized holes in the floors of these tunnels open into the rooms below, allowing the beholder to spy on creatures in its lair and perhaps target them with eye rays. (Opponents can shoot back, but the holes function like arrow slits and provide three-quarters cover to the beholder.)": "因为看守者的偏执是无止境的，所以它的巢穴经常设计成包括秘密通道，用于侦察或突袭。(这些特征没有在随附的地图上显示，但可以位于你认为合适的任何地方。) 一个典型的安排是，在巢穴的主要房间上方有一个隧道网络，每个隧道都足够宽，可以让人飞过去。这些通道的地板上有拳头大小的洞，可以通向下面的房间，让看守者可以窥视巢穴中的生物，也许可以用眼射线瞄准它们。(对手可以反击，但这些洞的功能就像箭缝一样，为看守者提供四分之三的掩护。)",
	"The lair has rooms set aside for the beholder's minions, where those creatures live, cook, eat, and sleep.": "巢穴里有为看守者的爪牙预留的房间，这些生物在那里生活、做饭、吃饭和睡觉。",
	"A beholder often sets aside a chamber to hold captives that it chooses not to kill. The simplest kind of prison, easy enough for a beholder to create, typically consists of 20-foot-deep holes disintegrated into the floor, some times covered with a wood or metal grating. A prisoner is stripped of weapons and magic items, thrown into one of the holes, and guarded by minions at all times.": "看守者通常会留出一个房间来关押它选择不杀的俘虏。最简单的一种监狱，对于一个看守者来说很容易创建，通常由20英尺深的洞组成，被分解在地板上，有些时候用木头或金属栅栏覆盖。囚犯被剥夺了武器和魔法物品，被扔进其中一个洞里，并一直由爪牙看守着。",
	"The beholder's private chamber is usually at the highest elevation inside the lair and accessible only through a long vertical tunnel. Here, the beholder rests and plots. The room typically contains a nest of sand or cloth bedding and the beholder's favorite pieces of sculpture.": "看守者的私人密室通常位于巢穴内的最高处，只能通过一条长长的垂直隧道进入。在这里，观察者休息和谋划。房间里通常有一窝沙子或布制的被褥和看守者最喜欢的雕塑作品。",
	"Beyond the lair entrance lies the vestibule. Rather than being sculpted with tools or eye rays, the entrance and the vestibule are left in their natural form to mislead intruders who might be expecting an artificially created structure. The floor of the vestibule is usually 15 feet or more lower than the entrance corridor, and the chamber is often inhabited by shriekers, which act as an early warning system.": "巢穴入口之外是前庭。入口和前庭并不是用工具或眼线雕刻出来的，而是以其自然形态存在，以误导那些可能期待人工创造的结构的入侵者。前庭的地板通常比入口处的走廊低15英尺或更多，而且室内经常居住着尖叫者，作为早期警告系统。",
	"A room not dedicated to some other purpose could be festooned with a variety of traps. In addition to traps that are meant to catch ground-based creatures, a beholder creates or positions certain traps so that they're effective against flying intruders.": "一个没有专门用于其他目的的房间可以用各种陷阱来装饰。除了用来捕捉地面生物的陷阱外，观察者还可以创造或安置某些陷阱，使其对飞行入侵者有效。",
	"Practically any kind of trap could be a feature of a beholder's lair. A few possibilities are described here.": "实际上，任何种类的陷阱都可以成为看守者巢穴的一个特征。这里描述了几种可能性。",
	"Simple yet effective, a covered pit trap is a hole covered with a false floor and perhaps concealed by a sprinkling of dirt or gravel. The pit might be empty, be filled with mud (causing anything trapped in it to eventually drown), or have spikes at the bottom.": "简单而有效，有盖坑道陷阱是一个用假地板覆盖的洞，也许还可以用洒上的泥土或沙砾掩盖。这个坑可能是空的，也可能装满了泥巴（导致被困在里面的东西最终被淹死），或者在底部有钉子。",
	"In a seldom-used cavern with a high ceiling, a beholder might erect a wall that doesn't reach the ceiling and build a trapped door into it. The beholder can fly over the trap, while intruders are forced to deal with the door or waste time trying to climb over the wall. A typical simple door trap is a pivoting spiked arm that swings downward to impale an intruder when the door is opened.": "在一个天花板很高的很少使用的洞穴里，一个beholder可能会竖起一堵达不到天花板的墙，并在墙里建一个陷阱门。观察者可以飞过陷阱，而入侵者则被迫对付门或浪费时间试图爬过墙。一个典型的简单的门陷阱是一个可旋转的带刺手臂，当门被打开时，它向下摆动以刺伤入侵者。",
	"In addition to making use of classic \"gravity traps\" such as the collapsing roof, the falling net, and the rolling sphere, a beholder can use its disintegration ray to blast a hole in the ceiling above its enemies, opening up a previously prepared chamber filled with mud, water, sand, garbage, green slime, petrified enemies, poison gas, swarms of centipedes, zombies, or any other sort of hazardous material or creatures.": "除了利用经典的 \"重力陷阱\"，如坍塌的屋顶、落下的网和滚动的球体，看守者可以用它的瓦解射线在敌人上方的天花板上炸出一个洞，打开一个事先准备好的密室，里面装满泥浆、水、沙子、垃圾、绿色粘液、石化的敌人、毒气、成群的蜈蚣、僵尸，或任何其他种类的危险物质或生物。",
	"One form of gas spore trap is nothing more than a small room or section of tunnel that contains one or more hovering gas spores. The passage leading to it is sealed off or constricted to prevent the fungus creatures from drifting into inhabited areas. Medium or smaller intruders can easily move through the passage but might have little warning about what lies ahead, especially if the passage has sharp turns that make it likely that the gas spore isn't seen until the last moment. A beholder might use its telekinesis ray to forcibly push a gas spore into an opponent, making the gas spore explode.": "一种形式的气体孢子陷阱不过是一个小房间或一段隧道，里面有一个或多个盘旋的气体孢子。通往它的通道被封闭或限制，以防止真菌生物漂移到有人居住的区域。中等或较小的入侵者可以很容易地穿过通道，但对前面的情况可能没有什么警告，特别是如果通道有急转弯，使得气体孢子有可能直到最后一刻才被看到。观察者可能会使用它的心灵感应射线，强行将气体孢子推到对手身上，使气体孢子爆炸。",
	"If its lair includes a long, narrow chamber with an uneven floor and multiple terraces, a beholder might turn this area into a killing ground. The floors count as {@quickref difficult terrain||3}, and the terraces mean that in some places climbing or jumping down is required to make progress. These areas are often seeded with perils both stationary and mobile. The beholder and its minions can bypass the area by means of secret doors at either end. Some obstacle courses feature low walls to slow enemies even further or a portcullis to trap them in one section of the chamber.": "如果它的巢穴包括一个狭长的密室，有不平整的地板和多个梯田，那么看守者可能会把这个区域变成一个杀人场所。地板算作（%0%），而梯田意味着在某些地方需要攀爬或跳下才能前进。这些区域通常有固定的和移动的危险种子。看守者和它的爪牙可以通过两端的秘密门绕过这个区域。有些障碍物通道的特点是有低矮的墙壁，以进一步减缓敌人的速度，或者有一个舷窗，将他们困在密室的一个部分。",
	"The main element of an oil sprayer trap is a large tank, filled with oil, embedded into the top of a column or located in a space above the trapped room. When the trap is triggered, a valve in the bottom of the tank opens, and oil spews into the room, making the floor slick and igniting if any open flames are present.": "喷油器的主要部件是一个装满油的大油箱，它被嵌入到柱子的顶部或位于被困房间上方的空间。当疏水阀被触发时，油罐底部的阀门就会打开，油就会喷到房间里，使地板变得光滑，如果有任何明火存在，就会被点燃。",
	"A beholder that has amassed many trophies might set aside an area in its lair dedicated to their display. A trophy gallery is often a long chamber decorated with mementos taken from creatures the beholder has slain. Niches and pedestals hold smaller objects, while larger objects are suspended from the ceiling or left freestanding in the room. To prevent minions from handling or trying to steal trophies, the more favored and valuable items are kept on high shelves, accessible to the flying beholder but out of reach of anyone on the ground.": "积累了许多战利品的持有者可能会在其巢穴中留出一块区域，专门用于展示这些战利品。战利品陈列室通常是一个长长的房间，上面装饰着从持有者所杀的生物身上取得的纪念品。壁龛和基座上摆放着较小的物品，而较大的物品则悬挂在天花板上或独立放置在房间里。为了防止奴才处理或试图偷取战利品，更受青睐和更有价值的物品被放在高高的架子上，飞行的看守者可以接触到，但地面上的人却无法触及。",
	"A beholder goes to a lot of trouble to make its lair as safe and comfortable as it possibly can, and so it rarely ventures outside. A typical beholder would primarily be concerned with securing the area in a 1-mile radius around its lair (corresponding to the area of the beholder's regional effects), but could range even farther if the need arises. It might leave home to confront or forestall the advance of creatures that it sees as threats, or to capture a new pack of minions, or to go after a particularly enticing trophy.": "一个beholder费尽心思使它的巢穴尽可能地安全和舒适，所以它很少冒险出去。一个典型的beholder将主要关注其巢穴周围1英里范围内的安全（相当于beholder的区域效应），但如果有需要，它的范围甚至会更远。它可能会离开家去对抗或阻止它认为有威胁的生物前进，或者去捕捉新的奴仆群，或者去追逐一个特别诱人的战利品。",
	"When a beholder goes on the offensive against a threat outside its lair, it plans ahead and makes use of all of its advantages. For example, if it decides a newly settled human village nearby is a threat, it and its minions will set up camp nearby and scout the area (usually by flying high overhead at night using darkvision) for one or two days. Once the layout and guard movements are known, the beholder sends its minions to attack or draw out defenders while it flies high overhead and uses its eye rays to subdue the village, targeting leaders and other formidable foes before significant resistance can be mounted.": "当beholder对其巢穴外的威胁发起进攻时，它会提前计划并利用其所有的优势。例如，如果它决定附近新定居的人类村庄是一个威胁，它和它的爪牙就会在附近扎营，并对该地区进行一到两天的侦察（通常是在夜间使用暗视仪从高空飞行）。一旦知道了村庄的布局和守卫的动向，看守者就会派它的爪牙去攻击或引出守卫者，而它则在高空飞行，用它的眼睛射线来制服村庄，在可以进行重大抵抗之前瞄准领导人和其他强大的敌人。",
	"One of these raids usually lasts less than an hour, after which the beholder withdraws its forces, leaving the terrified survivors to wonder when the next attack will occur. Unless they flee, the beholder and its forces return night after night, each time eliminating key defenders, and ultimately breaking the morale of the survivors, at which point the beholder's minions can capture anyone or anything worth keeping and raze the settlement.": "一次突袭通常持续不到一个小时，之后持币人就会撤走它的部队，留下惊恐的幸存者想知道下一次攻击会在什么时候发生。除非他们逃跑，否则持神者和它的部队会夜复一夜地回来，每次都会消灭关键的守卫者，并最终打击幸存者的士气，这时持神者的爪牙可以抓到任何值得保留的人或物，并夷平定居点。",
	"A beholder carefully scrutinizes all the treasure in its lair and divides the booty into five groups: tools, gifts, hazards, trophies, and clutter.": "一个观察者仔细检查了它巢穴中的所有宝物，并将战利品分为五组：工具、礼物、危险品、战利品和杂物。",
	"A {@b tool} is any treasure that the beholder can use as personal gear. A beholder's body can't use many kinds of humanoid-type magic items because it doesn't have the body parts to wear them; for example, it can't use gloves or boots because it doesn't have hands or feet. But a beholder could wear magic rings on its eyestalks or affix a magic cloak to its back, and the items function as they would if used by a humanoid.": "A{@b tool}是指任何可以作为个人装备使用的宝物，beholder。看守者的身体不能使用许多种人形类型的魔法物品，因为它没有穿戴它们的身体部位；例如，它不能使用手套或靴子，因为它没有手或脚。但是，观音可以在它的眼柄上戴上魔法戒指，或者在它的背上贴上魔法斗篷，而这些物品的功能就像人形生物使用的那样。",
	"At your discretion, a beholder might be able to use magic items that must be held to activate, such as wands; the beholder is assumed to be using its telekinesis eye ray to move and point the item in the same way that a humanoid would use its hand. A beholder can't attune to items that require attunement by a spellcaster or a member of a certain class.": "根据你的判断，持物者也许可以使用必须拿着才能激活的魔法物品，比如魔杖；持物者被认为是在使用它的心灵感应眼线来移动和指向物品，就像一个人形生物使用它的手一样。持心者不能调整那些需要由施法者或某个等级的成员进行调整的物品。",
	"A {@b gift} is a treasure the beholder can't use itself but that would be useful to a minion, such as magic gloves, boots, armor, or an item it can't attune itself to. Usually a beholder gives gifts to make a minion more powerful and better at its job, which typically involves guarding the beholder's lair. Sometimes it uses gifts as rewards and incentives for exceptional minions; although it prefers to rule by coercion and fear, it understands that better results can sometimes be achieved by rewarding positive behavior instead of punishing negative behavior.": "一个{@b gift}是看守者自己不能使用但对奴才有用的宝物，比如魔法手套、靴子、盔甲，或者一个它自己不能调整的物品。通常情况下，持有者给予礼物是为了让奴才更强大，更好地完成其工作，这通常涉及到守护持有者的巢穴。有时，它用礼物作为对杰出奴才的奖励和激励；虽然它更喜欢用胁迫和恐惧来统治，但它明白，有时通过奖励积极行为而不是惩罚消极行为可以取得更好的效果。",
	"A {@b hazard} can be put to use in an offensive, defensive, or utilitarian capacity. Beholders are skilled at repurposing cursed or dangerous items as elements of traps or obstacles in its lair, especially if such an item emits an ongoing effect that it can suppress as needed with its antimagic cone.": "一个{@b hazard}可以被用于进攻、防御或功利性的目的。兽人善于重新利用被诅咒的或危险的物品作为其巢穴中的陷阱或障碍物的元素，尤其是当这种物品发出一种持续的效果，它可以根据需要用反魔法锥压制。",
	"A {@b trophy} is a treasure that a beholder cherishes as evidence of its power, or serves as a remembrance of victory over its enemies, or evokes another sort of positive reaction from it. The preserved corpse of a rival beholder (or any parts it can recover from a battle) would certainly be a prized trophy, as would be the skull of a defeated dragon, the clothing of a famous adventurer the beholder killed, or art objects that are pleasing to its alien senses. A beholder usually has the location of all its trophies memorized and immediately senses if something is missing or out of place. {@b Clutter} is treasure that has intrinsic value, but isn't immediately useful to the beholder or its minions. This category includes currency, gems, jewelry, and magic items that nobody in the lair can use or use well. These items are stored somewhere in the lair until they're disposed of-sometimes by distributing them among the minions as gifts, other times by disintegration.": "一个{@b trophy}的宝物是一个beholder所珍视的，作为其力量的证据，或作为战胜敌人的纪念，或引起它的另一种积极反应。竞争对手的尸体（或它能从战斗中恢复的任何部分）肯定会是一个珍贵的战利品，就像被打败的龙的头骨、被它杀死的著名冒险家的衣服，或让它的异类感官愉悦的艺术品一样。看守者通常会记住它所有战利品的位置，如果有什么东西丢失或不合适，它就会立即感觉到。{@b Clutter}是具有内在价值的宝物，但对看守者或其爪牙来说并不立即有用。这类物品包括货币、宝石、珠宝，以及巢穴中无人能用或用不好的魔法物品。这些物品被存放在巢穴中的某个地方，直到它们被处理掉--有时是作为礼物在爪牙之间分发，有时是被分解掉。",
	"A beholder's personality greatly influences how it categorizes its treasures. A braggart beholder might use a slain enemy's magic battleaxe as a trophy, but a manipulative beholder might give that axe as a gift to a lieutenant in order to encourage competition between its upper ranks. An inventive beholder might use an {@i eversmoking bottle} to obscure dozens of pit traps in a room, but a more militaristic one might not have a use for it and treat it as clutter. Circumstances might change the role of a piece of treasure-a {@i staff of the python} used to prop up a stone block trap might be given as a gift if the beholder acquires a minion who can attune the item.": "持币人的个性在很大程度上影响了其对宝物的分类。一个爱吹牛的人可能会把被杀的敌人的魔法战斧作为战利品，但一个爱操纵的人可能会把那把斧头作为礼物送给一个中尉，以鼓励其上层的竞争。一个有创造力的看守者可能会用一个{@i eversmoking bottle}来掩盖房间里的几十个坑洞陷阱，但一个更军事化的看守者可能对它没有用处，把它当作杂物。情况可能会改变一件宝物的作用--用来支撑石块陷阱的(1%)可能会被当作礼物送出，如果持有者获得了一个可以调整该物品的奴仆。",
	"Beholders often make use of minions. Establishing control over these creatures usually involves the use of its eye rays, but eventually the minions come to understand that the beholder can kill them whenever it wants and it is in their best interest to stop resisting and just obey the beholder's orders.": "看守者经常利用爪牙。建立对这些生物的控制通常涉及到使用它的眼睛射线，但最终奴才们会明白，持物者可以随时杀死他们，停止抵抗并服从持物者的命令对他们来说是最有利的。",
	"Minions build walls in the beholder's lair, distribute food to other residents, and carve out new living spaces for themselves and other minions-tasks that the beholder considers beneath its personal attention. Some even worship the beholder as an angry, capricious deity.": "仆人们在看守者的巢穴中建造墙壁，向其他居民分发食物，并为自己和其他仆人开辟新的生活空间--看守者认为这些任务不在其个人关注范围之内。有些人甚至把看守者当作一个愤怒、任性的神灵来崇拜。",
	"Three tables-Beholder Lesser Minions, Beholder Greater Minions, and Beholder Pets-make it easy to stock a beholder's lair with such creatures.": "三张表格--\"较小的仆人\"、\"较大的仆人 \"和 \"仆人的宠物\"--使我们可以很容易地在仆人的巢穴中储存这些生物。",
	"If a beholder's retinue were likened to an army, the grunts would be represented by its lesser minions, intelligent creatures that can talk and usually live in large groups. They handle menial tasks for the beholder such as hunting, scouting, and guarding the lair.": "如果把看守者的随从比作一支军队，那么步兵将由其较小的奴仆代表，他们是能说话的智能生物，通常生活在大群体中。他们为看守者处理琐碎的任务，如狩猎、侦察和守卫巢穴。",
	"A beholder's greater minions are formidable opponents. In the lair, they might be stationed where they can catch intruders in an ambush, or they could be a last line of defense against foes that threaten the inner sanctum.": "一个看守者的大奴仆是可怕的对手。在巢穴中，他们可能驻扎在可以捕捉到入侵者的伏击的地方，或者他们可以作为威胁内部圣殿的敌人的最后一道防线。",
	"A beholder often has one or more pets in its lair, mainly because (for whatever reason) it enjoys the company of such creatures. Pets are usually of low intelligence and are kept around because of their combat abilities, entertainment value, or trophy status.": "兽人的巢穴中通常有一个或多个宠物，主要是因为（无论出于什么原因）它喜欢与这些生物为伴。宠物通常智力低下，因为它们的战斗能力、娱乐价值或战利品地位而被留在身边。",
	"Roll twice, ignoring results above 65": "滚动两次，无视65以上的结果",
	"{@dice 1d2} {@creature fire giant||fire giants}, {@dice 1d3} {@creature frost giant||frost giants}, {@dice 2d4} {@creature hill giant||hill giants} or {@dice 1d6} {@creature stone giant||stone giants} (as appropriate to the terrain)": "{@dice 1d2} {@creature fire giant||fire giants}, {@dice 1d3} {@creature frost giant||frost giants}, {@dice 2d4} {@creature hill giant||hill giants} 或 {@dice 1d6} {@creature stone giant||stone giants}（根据地形情况而定）",
	"Roll twice, ignoring results above 75": "滚动两次，忽略75以上的结果",
	"The Xanathar Guild is a thieves' and slavers' guild operating underneath the city of Waterdeep in the Forgotten Realms setting. The guildmaster is a beholder-the latest in a series of such creatures. Like its predecessors, the beholder uses \"the Xanathar\" as a title rather than its personal name (which is Zushaxx). The guild has been in operation for nearly two hundred years, with a different beholder taking over every few decades.": "Xanathar公会是一个盗贼和奴隶主公会，在被遗忘的领域的Waterdeep城下运作。行会会长是一个beholder--一系列此类生物中的最新一员。和它的前辈们一样，这个人用 \"Xanathar \"作为称号，而不是它的个人名字（即Zushaxx）。这个公会已经运作了近两百年，每隔几十年就有一个不同的beholder接手。",
	"The Xanathar, like its forerunners, is an eye tyrant-a type of beholder that chooses to live among other creatures in a position of superiority over them. Its paranoia is kept under control most of the time, and it turns its strange mind to the pursuit of organized crime in Undermountain and Waterdeep. The Xanathar believes its intelligence and magic make it uniquely suited for this-even more so than its slain predecessor-and it uses its abilities to ruthlessly enforce its will on as much political and criminal territory as possible.": "Xanathar，像它的先驱一样，是一个眼球暴君--一种选择生活在其他生物中，处于比它们更优越地位的眼球。它的偏执狂在大多数时候都被控制住了，它把自己奇怪的心思转到追求地下城和水底世界的有组织犯罪上。萨纳塔认为它的智慧和魔法使它独特地适合做这件事--甚至比它被杀的前辈更适合，它利用自己的能力在尽可能多的政治和犯罪领域无情地执行自己的意志。",
	"The Xanathar's bond is its lair, an elaborate cavern complex created by its predecessors, carved out between the twisting sewers of Waterdeep. It almost never leaves its home, for at the center of this world it is the master of all it sees and safe from outside threats. The expansive lair is well stocked with the exotic pleasures it craves, such as scented oils for bathing, fragrant incense, and fine foods prepared by skilled chefs. It surrounds itself with evidence of its wealth and success, eating off gold plates, drinking from diamond-encrusted chalices, decorating its sleeping area with marvelous tapestries, and adorning itself and its sanctum with powerful magic items.": "萨纳塔的纽带是它的巢穴，一个由它的前辈们创造的精致的洞穴建筑群，在沃特迪普曲折的下水道之间开凿出来。它几乎从未离开过自己的家，因为在这个世界的中心，它是它所看到的一切的主宰，并且免受外界的威胁。这个宽广的巢穴里有它所渴望的异国情调，比如沐浴用的香油、芬芳的熏香，以及由熟练厨师准备的精美食物。它用财富和成功的证据围绕着自己，用金盘子吃饭，用镶钻的圣杯喝酒，用奇妙的挂毯装饰睡眠区，用强大的魔法物品装饰自己和它的圣殿。",
	"Its fear of conspiracies is merely dormant, though, not absent. From time to time it is gripped by overwhelming concerns about assassination plots, revenge-seekers, and other schemes against it. When these thoughts bubble to the surface, the Xanathar might crack down on its lieutenants, interpreting their mistakes as disobedience, their failures as deliberate attempts to undermine its power, and their successes as challenges to its superiority. The beholder's ire might manifest as abruptly as a disintegration ray or as slowly as an angry glare and increasing scrutiny over the next few weeks.": "它对阴谋的恐惧只是处于休眠状态，但并不是没有。它不时地被对暗杀阴谋、复仇者和其他针对它的计划的压倒性担忧所笼罩。当这些想法浮出水面时，Xanathar可能会打击它的副手，把他们的错误解释为不服从命令，把他们的失败解释为蓄意破坏它的权力，把他们的成功解释为对它的优势的挑战。观察者的愤怒可能会像瓦解射线一样突然表现出来，也可能会像愤怒的目光一样慢慢表现出来，并在接下来的几周内不断加强审查。",
	"The Xanathar is ambitious and wants to expand its power by making alliances, but it is constantly wary of betrayal. The only allies it considers relatively safe are individuals that it (or its predecessor) has worked with for years, and most of these are creatures it has no reason to fear because they aren't a physical threat to it or the guild. It is hesitant to form alliances with other powerful groups, and is likely to break off ties with a new ally if it senses even a hint of betrayal or difficulty. If an organization is useful but significantly weaker than the guild, the Xanathar is likely to absorb its members and resources into its guild (either immediately or gradually) so it can keep an eye on threats from within that group.": "Xanathar雄心勃勃，希望通过结盟来扩大自己的权力，但它对背叛一直保持警惕。它认为唯一相对安全的盟友是与它（或它的前身）合作多年的个人，而这些人大多是它没有理由害怕的生物，因为它们对它或行会没有人身威胁。它对与其他强大的团体结成联盟犹豫不决，如果它感觉到哪怕是一丝背叛或困难，都有可能与新盟友断绝关系。如果一个组织是有用的，但明显比公会弱，Xanathar可能会将其成员和资源吸收到公会中（无论是立即还是逐步），这样它就可以密切关注来自该团体内部的威胁。",
	"Like all beholders, the Xanathar craves information. It is aware of the great library at Candlekeep and the lore stored there, and one of its main objectives is to get an agent into the place that can start sending copies of that information back to the Xanathar for review. The Xanathar's ultimate goal is to control the entire region under Waterdeep (both Undermountain and Skullport), giving it as much political clout as all the Lords of Waterdeep combined.": "像所有的持有者一样，Xanathar渴望获得信息。它知道烛龙镇的大图书馆和那里储存的传说，它的主要目标之一是让一个代理人进入那里，开始把这些信息的副本送回给Xanathar审查。萨纳塔的最终目标是控制水底世界的整个区域（包括山下和斯库尔波特），使其拥有与水底世界所有领主加起来一样多的政治影响力。",
	"Thanks to its superior intelligence and its unique way of thinking, the Xanathar is able to efficiently supervise and direct the efforts of many creatures at the same time. It holds sway over a dozen specialized lieutenants. Each lieutenant is responsible for operating one of the aspects of guild business, including assassination, blackmail, extortion, mercenaries, slavery, smuggling, spying, and thievery (of these operations, slavery and thievery are the largest). When one needs to be replaced, the best candidates are those who appreciate the benefits of strict organization (and thus are lawful evil or at worst neutral evil) and who have a high tolerance for their boss's sometimes erratic behavior.": "由于其卓越的智力和独特的思维方式，Xanathar能够同时有效地监督和指导许多生物的工作。它掌握着十几个专门的副手的权力。每个中尉负责操作公会业务的一个方面，包括暗杀、勒索、敲诈、雇佣兵、奴隶制、走私、间谍和偷窃（在这些业务中，奴隶制和偷窃是最大的）。当一个人需要被替换时，最好的人选是那些欣赏严格组织的好处的人（因此是合法的邪恶或最差的中性邪恶），并且对他们的老板有时不稳定的行为有很高的容忍度。",
	"Each lieutenant is allowed to manage its part of the guild operation as desired. Some use a direct, hands-on approach, and some establish a chain of command that establishes a clear hierarchy from the top to the lowest underling. As long as a lieutenant's operation runs smoothly, the Xanathar doesn't object to methods or micromanage day-to-day activity.": "每个中尉都被允许根据需要管理自己的那部分公会运作。有些人使用直接的、亲力亲为的方法，有些人则建立了一个指挥系统，从高层到最底层的下属都建立了明确的等级制度。只要中尉的运作顺利，Xanathar就不会反对方法或微观管理日常活动。",
	"When a human megalomaniac rises to power in an evil organization, that individual is always at risk of being killed or replaced by a power-hungry rival.": "当一个人类的自大狂在一个邪恶的组织中崛起时，这个人总是有可能被杀死或被一个渴望权力的对手取代。",
	"When such a group is led by a beholder rather than a human, the tyrant has incredible staying power against challengers. Not only are its opponents unsure of the best way to kill it, but it can quickly retaliate with lethal force against multiple enemies at the same time, and it literally sleeps with its eyes open. The only real threat to the Xanathar's rule is another beholder, which speaks to the reason why the Xanathar Guild has been led by a succession of beholders instead of by various humanoid or inhuman creatures. Lieutenants who have their own ambitions, who might come to oppose the tyrant or fear for their safety, are much more likely to flee (or \"retire\") than to confront the beholder. The petrified heads of several  traitorous lieutenants decorate the Xanathar's lair as testimony to how it deals with challengers.": "当这样一个群体由一个beholder而不是一个人类领导时，暴君对挑战者有难以置信的持久力。它的对手不仅不知道杀死它的最佳方法，而且它可以同时对多个敌人迅速进行致命的报复，而且它简直是睁着眼睛睡觉。对Xanathar统治的唯一真正威胁是另一个beholder，这也说明了为什么Xanathar公会一直由一连串的beholder领导，而不是由各种人形或非人形生物领导的原因。那些有自己野心的副手，可能会来反对暴君或担心自己的安全，他们更有可能逃离（或 \"退休\"），而不是与beholder对抗。几个叛徒副官的石化头颅装饰着Xanathar的巢穴，见证了它如何处理挑战者。",
	"In addition to its lieutenants, the Xanathar has many minions with specific jobs. These underlings don't have as much clout as the lieutenants do, but they do hold key roles in its guild and have some degree of influence in the organization. Among these are the beholder's accountant, chamberlain, chief messenger, doctor, fish-keeper, fortune-teller, lawyer, master entertainer, monster trainer, trap-setter, and warden for its private prison. The individuals in these roles generally serve the Xanathar for months or years, because replacements that have the same specialized skills can be hard to come by.": "除了它的副手之外，Xanathar还有许多有特殊工作的爪牙。这些下属没有副官那么大的影响力，但他们确实在公会中担任关键角色，在组织中具有一定程度的影响力。在这些人中，有会计师、内侍、首席信使、医生、养鱼人、算命先生、律师、娱乐大师、怪物训练师、陷阱设置者，以及私人监狱的典狱长。担任这些职务的人通常为Xanathar服务数月或数年，因为具有相同专业技能的替代者可能很难找到。",
	"The organization's grunt-level employees-thieves, slavers, and ordinary thugs-work for the Xanathar Guild because it pays well. They don't necessarily know their leader is a beholder; they just know the boss is powerful, dangerous, and doesn't tolerate mistakes.": "该组织的低级雇员--盗贼、奴隶主和普通暴徒--为Xanathar公会工作，因为它的报酬很高。他们不一定知道他们的领导是个神棍；他们只知道老板很强大，很危险，而且不能容忍错误。",
	"Although previous Xanathars carefully guarded the facts of their true nature and allowed only a handful of their lieutenants to know the truth, the current Xanathar treats the matter more like an open secret.": "虽然以前的Xanathars小心翼翼地保护着他们的真实性质，只允许他们的少数副手知道真相，但现在的Xanathar对待这件事更像是一个公开的秘密。",
	"All of its lieutenants, as well as many mid-level members of the guild that the Xanathar trusts, know that the guild is run by a beholder.": "它的所有副手，以及Xanathar信任的许多公会中层成员都知道，公会是由一个beholder管理的。",
	"Most of the guild's low-ranking members have an idea that the boss isn't human, especially given how long the Xanathar has been in power (they aren't aware that several beholders have held the job). Most believe their leader is a member of a long-lived race, perhaps a dwarf or an elf. Some think the truth is more monstrous, and that the Xanathar is a drow or perhaps a dragon in humanoid form.": "公会的大多数低级成员都有一个想法，那就是老板不是人类，特别是考虑到Xanathar掌权的时间有多长（他们不知道有几个beholder担任过这个职位）。大多数人认为他们的领袖是一个长寿种族的成员，也许是一个矮人或精灵。有些人认为事实更加怪异，Xanathar是一个乌鸦，或许是一个人形的龙。",
	"The people of Waterdeep are generally aware that there are one or more guilds controlling criminal activity in the city. Rumors occasionally surface about a monstrous crime lord, such as a demon or a dragon, that guides its organization from the shadows. Most common folk dismiss these rumors and the fools who circulate them, asserting that the Lords of Waterdeep would never allow such creatures to roam the city.": "沃特德普的人们一般都知道有一个或多个行会在控制城市的犯罪活动。偶尔也会有关于一个可怕的犯罪头目的传言，比如恶魔或龙，在暗处指导其组织。大多数普通人对这些谣言和传播这些谣言的傻瓜不屑一顾，他们断言水底城的领主绝不会允许这种生物在城市里游荡。",
	"The saga of giantkind began in the dawn of the world. Elves had yet to set dainty foot out of the fey realm when the thunder of the giants' steps shook the world to its bones, and even the dragons were yet unaware of the power and glory they would attain. The record of that early age had already vanished into the mists of legend by the time humankind came onto the scene. Now, not even the giants know the full truth of their beginnings.": "巨人族的传奇始于世界的黎明。当巨人的脚步声震撼世界的时候，精灵们还没有踏出精灵界，甚至连龙都还没有意识到他们将获得的力量和荣耀。当人类出现在现场时，那个早期时代的记录已经消失在传说的迷雾中了。现在，甚至连巨人都不知道他们开始的全部真相。",
	"All that the giants and their kin know for certain is that they are sibling races. Humanoids such as elves, humans, and dwarves are more similar in size and shape than the disparate giant types are to one another, but those races have no shared heritage. In contrast, every true giant, regardless of type, can trace its ancestry directly to Annam the All-Father. Most giants believe that Annam took a number of consorts in addition to his mate Othea, accounting for the variety in appearance and abilities among the types of giantkind.": "巨人和他们的亲属所能确定的是，他们是兄弟姐妹种族。像精灵、人类和矮人这样的类人，在尺寸和形状上比不同类型的巨人彼此之间更相似，但这些种族没有共同的遗产。相比之下，每一个真正的巨人，无论其类型如何，都可以直接追溯到全能之父安南的祖先。大多数巨人认为，除了他的配偶奥赛亚之外，安南还娶了许多妃子，这就说明了巨人类型在外观和能力上的多样性。",
	"Giants and giant kin rank among the world's most fearsome creatures, literally towering over the other, younger beings that crowd the world. Yet nowadays most giants live in isolation or in obscure locations, exhibiting none of the collective grandeur and power of their forebears.": "巨人和巨人的亲属是世界上最可怕的生物之一，简直高过了世界上其他年轻的生物。然而，如今大多数巨人都生活在与世隔绝或不起眼的地方，没有表现出他们祖先的集体雄风和力量。",
	"Encountering a giant can be an awe-inspiring and disorienting experience. First comes a rhythmic booming, felt more than heard, that resolves slowly into the sound of footsteps: a giant is near! Loose stones vibrate and tumble down the hillside. Trees sway, then bend aside as the colossus emerges. How can anything be that big? Is it a trick of perspective?": "遇到一个巨人可能是一个令人敬畏和迷失方向的经历。首先是有节奏的轰鸣声，感觉到的比听到的多，慢慢变成了脚步声：一个巨人正在靠近！这时，你就会发现，在山坡上有一个巨大的石块。松动的石头震动着，从山坡上滚落下来。树木摇晃，然后随着巨人的出现而弯向一边。怎么会有这么大的东西？这是个透视的把戏吗？",
	"When giants first appear before a band of adventurers, they demonstrate the qualities that make them spectacular to behold:": "当巨人第一次出现在一队冒险家面前时，他们展示了使他们壮观的品质。",
	"Most giants can easily peer in a second-floor window. The larger ones would have to stoop to get down to that level! A giant's metal hammer could serve as an anvil for a human smith, and a giant's shield is bigger and heavier than a feasting table.": "大多数巨人可以很容易地在二楼的窗户里窥视。大一点的则要弯腰才能到那一层! 巨人的金属锤子可以作为人类铁匠的铁砧，而巨人的盾牌比宴席桌更大、更重。",
	"If a giant sits on a wagon, its wheels and axles are liable to snap like twigs. A giant can crush a house or capsize a ship simply by carelessly shifting its weight. An ox that strays too close to a sleeping giant could wind up pinned or crushed if the giant rolls over suddenly.": "如果一个巨人坐在马车上，它的车轮和车轴很可能会像树枝一样折断。巨人只需不经意地转移重量，就能压垮一座房子或掀翻一艘船。一头牛如果离睡着的巨人太近，如果巨人突然翻身，就会被夹住或压死。",
	"The footsteps of giants in the distance are often initially mistaken for thunder, even on a clear day. The sounds of a giant beating a weapon against its shield and bellowing a challenge to foes are strident enough to knock dishes from shelves and rattle doors in their frames.": "巨人在远处的脚步声最初往往被误认为是雷声，即使是在晴朗的日子里。巨人用武器击打盾牌，并向敌人发出挑战的声音，足以将餐具从架子上打落，并将门在框架中敲响。",
	"A charging warhorse at full gallop, capable of bowling over a line of human warriors, merely crumples against the bulk of a giant. A giant could kick a cart with enough force to send it smashing through a house, and a giant's club—the size of, if not actually, an entire tree—could level the same house with a single blow.": "一匹全速奔跑的战马，能够越过一排人类战士，但面对巨人的身躯，却只能溃不成军。巨人可以用足够的力量踢一辆马车，让它砸穿一栋房子，而巨人的棍子--即使不是真的，也有一整棵树那么大--可以一击打平同一栋房子。",
	"In an age before human and elf, when all dragons were young, Annam the All-Father put the first giants upon the world. These giants were reflections of his divine offspring and also children of the world, birthed from the marrow of mountains, the hot blood of volcanoes, and the breath of hurricanes.": "在人类和精灵之前的时代，当所有的龙都还年轻的时候，全能之父安南把第一批巨人带到了世界上。这些巨人是他神圣的后代的反映，也是世界的孩子，从山的骨髓、火山的热血和飓风的气息中孕育出来。",
	"Annam conceived the giants to be masters of the world. He gave them great height so they would look down on all they ruled. He created a hierarchy for his children-the ordning-so that all would know their status with respect to one another, and would know who among them stood nearest the knee of the All-Father.": "安南设想巨人要成为世界的主人。他给了他们很高的身高，这样他们就可以俯视他们所统治的一切。他为他的孩子们创造了一个等级制度--Ordning--以便所有人都知道他们彼此之间的地位，并知道他们中谁最接近全能之父的膝盖。",
	"United in purpose, Annam's children built Ostoria, the fabled empire of the giants, where they lived according to the ordning. Storm giants ruled all from both below and above. They held sway over the oceans from undersea fortresses and lorded over the land from castles in the sky. Cloud giants built immense floating cities and served the storm giants as their strong right hands. Stone giants and fire giants settled on the mountaintops and in the sprawling caverns beneath them, where they carved and forged the greatest works of giant art and craft. Frost giants defended Ostoria with the might of their arms, not just on the chilly peaks and glaciers but on every frontier. Hill giants sprawled over all other lands, subjugating lesser creatures through brute force.": "安南的孩子们团结一致，建立了奥斯托里亚，传说中的巨人帝国，他们在那里按照法令生活。风暴巨人们从下面和上面统治着一切。他们在海底堡垒中控制着海洋，在天空的城堡中统治着陆地。云巨人建造了巨大的浮动城市，并作为风暴巨人的有力助手为其服务。石巨人和火巨人定居在山顶和山下广阔的洞穴中，他们在那里雕刻和铸造最伟大的巨人艺术和工艺作品。冰霜巨人用他们强大的武器保卫着奥斯托利亚，不仅仅是在寒冷的山峰和冰川上，而是在每一个边境地区。山地巨人横跨所有其他土地，通过蛮力征服了较小的生物。",
	"The tale of Ostoria is drawn from the Forgotten Realms. Think of it as a good example of how giants developed on many worlds, as it captures their rise and fall from prominence in a manner that is iconic to many D&D settings. In your own world, you can replace Ostoria with another giant empire or adapt it to create your own origin story.": "奥斯托利亚的故事取材于《被遗忘的领域》。可以把它看作是巨人在许多世界中发展的一个很好的例子，因为它以一种对许多D&D设定具有标志性的方式捕捉到了他们的崛起和衰落。在你自己的世界中，你可以用另一个巨人帝国取代奥斯托里亚，或者改编它来创造你自己的起源故事。",
	"All told, the empire of Ostoria dominated the world for four millennia before its decline began in a genocidal struggle against the dragons that came to be known as the Thousand-Year War.": "总而言之，奥斯托利亚帝国统治了世界四千年，然后在与龙族的种族灭绝式斗争中开始衰落，这场战争被称为千年战争。",
	"Dragons had lived in and around Ostoria in relative peace since the empire's foundation. Conflicts between dragons and giants in those days were personal, not tribal or regional, and usually involved bragging rights or hunting territory. Differences were settled by individual contests of might, wits, or skill. That situation persisted for generations, until the red dragon Garyx inflamed the greed and envy in its followers by railing against the giants' prosperity, and they rose up in response.": "自帝国成立以来，龙一直生活在奥斯托利亚及其周围地区，相对和平。在那些日子里，龙和巨人之间的冲突是个人的，而不是部落或地区的，而且通常涉及吹嘘的权利或狩猎的领土。分歧通过个人的力量、智慧或技巧的较量来解决。这种情况持续了几代人，直到红龙加里克斯通过抨击巨人的繁荣而激起其追随者的贪婪和嫉妒，他们才起而响应。",
	"At least, that's what most giants believed to have happened. No one really knows any longer what set off the war. But once battle began, the long-standing peace between giants and dragons crumbled everywhere. Foes tore at each others' throats in all parts of Ostoria. There were no front lines or safe havens, only endless ambushes, sieges, and atrocities committed against giants and dragons alike. Eventually, none were left alive on either side who had seen the war's beginning. Age and brutality had claimed them all, and the few giants and dragons then alive had spent their entire existence at war. The Thousand-Year War didn't truly end so much as it wasted away through attrition and exhaustion.": "至少，这就是大多数巨头认为发生的事情。没有人真正知道是什么引发了这场战争。但是一旦战斗开始，巨人和龙之间长期存在的和平就会四处崩溃。敌人们在奥斯托利亚的所有地方互相撕咬着对方的喉咙。没有前线或安全避难所，只有无尽的伏击、围攻和对巨人和龙的暴行。最终，双方都没有活着看到战争开始的人。岁月和残暴夺走了他们所有人，当时活着的少数巨人和龙在战争中度过了他们的一生。千年战争并没有真正结束，而是在消耗和疲惫中消亡。",
	"The realm that could still be called Ostoria survived only far in the north. A few outposts and fragment kingdoms, such as the fire giants' Helligheim and the stone giants' Nedeheim, clung to life in deep caverns and hidden valleys. In the millennia that followed, even these places fell, and what remained of Ostorian territory became barren, shrouded in ice as thick as mountains. Since that time, many lesser races have attained greatness and themselves fallen into obscurity. Few hints of the giants' once-great empire have survived the relentless accumulation of years.": "仍然可以被称为奥斯托利亚的王国只在遥远的北方幸存下来。一些前哨站和碎片王国，如火巨人的Helligheim和石巨人的Nedeheim，在深邃的洞穴和隐蔽的山谷中坚持着生命。在随后的几千年里，甚至这些地方也沦陷了，奥斯托利亚领土上剩下的地方变得贫瘠，被像山一样厚的冰层所笼罩。从那时起，许多较小的种族获得了伟大的成就，而他们自己却陷入了默默无闻。巨人曾经的伟大帝国在无情的岁月积淀中几乎没有任何痕迹。",
	"Voninheim (\"Titan Home\" in the Giant language) stood as the capital of Ostoria for millennia. It was an awe-inspiring structure of iron and stone, raised by magic as much as by mortal hands. Some attributed its construction directly to one or more of Annam's sons, arguing that even giants couldn't have erected such a monumental edifice. The palace stood firm and unshaken as glaciers that could flatten mountains assailed it and flowed around it, until only its iron spires jutted above the ice like great, gray fangs. Eventually the relentless ice buried it utterly, and Voninheim was abandoned. Many giants seek to rediscover its location: some hope to recapture the lost glory of Ostoria, but others want only to claim the mighty weapons of legend said to be entombed in its frozen halls.": "Voninheim（巨人语言中的 \"泰坦之家\"）作为奥斯托利亚的首都已经存在了千年之久。它是一个令人敬畏的铁石结构，由魔法和凡人之手共同建造而成。有些人把它的建造直接归功于安南的一个或多个儿子，认为即使是巨人也不可能建起这样一座不朽的建筑。这座宫殿岿然不动，任凭可以压平山脉的冰川袭击它，并在它周围流淌，直到只有它的铁尖顶像巨大的灰色獠牙一样突出在冰面上。最终，无情的冰雪将它彻底掩埋，沃宁海姆被遗弃。许多巨人试图重新发现它的位置：一些人希望重新获得奥斯托利亚失去的荣耀，但其他人只想获得传说中的强大武器，据说它们被埋藏在冰封的大厅里。",
	"But the giants remember. Their empire and their unified purpose are long gone, but a yearning for a return to the greatness that was once theirs burns in all their memories.": "但巨人记得。他们的帝国和统一的目标早已不复存在，但他们所有的记忆中都燃烧着对回归曾经的伟大的渴望。",
	"When Ostoria fell, Annam disowned his children, swearing never to regard the giants again until they returned Ostoria to its past prominence and reclaimed their rightful positions as rulers of the world. Giants, therefore, don't pray to Annam, who refuses to hear them. Instead, they revere his divine children, as well as a host of other hero-deities and godly villains that are minor members of the pantheon.": "当奥斯托利亚陷落时，安南不承认他的孩子们，发誓再也不理会巨人，直到他们把奥斯托利亚恢复到过去的显赫地位，并重新获得他们作为世界统治者的合法地位。因此，巨人不向安南祈祷，安南拒绝听他们的祈祷。相反，他们崇敬他的神的孩子，以及其他许多英雄神灵和神的恶棍，他们是万神殿的次要成员。",
	"Chief among the giant gods are the six sons of Annam. The brothers are Stronmaus (champion and favorite of storm giants), Memnor (cloud giants), Surtur (fire giants), Thrym (frost giants), Skoraeus Stonebones (stone giants), and Grolantor (hill giants).": "巨人神中最主要的是安南的六个儿子。他们兄弟俩分别是斯特朗莫斯（风暴巨人的冠军和宠儿）、梅姆诺尔（云巨人）、苏尔图尔（火巨人）、特里姆（霜巨人）、斯科雷欧斯-石骨（石巨人）和戈兰托尔（山丘巨人）。",
	"Although each of Annam's sons is typically worshiped by giants of a particular type, they, like Annam himself, aren't racially distinct. Stronmaus, for example, doesn't look like a storm giant, though he is often depicted as one in carvings and other art. Like Annam and each of his brothers, Stronmaus is a unique godly being with no mortal equivalent. His temperament and interests are similar to those of the storm giants, so most of his followers are of that type.": "尽管安南的每个儿子通常都被特定类型的巨人所崇拜，但他们和安南本人一样，并没有种族上的区别。例如，斯特朗莫斯（Stronmaus）看起来并不像一个风暴巨人，尽管他在雕刻和其他艺术作品中经常被描绘成一个风暴巨人。像安南和他的每一个兄弟一样，斯特龙莫斯是一个独特的神性存在，没有凡人可以比拟。他的气质和兴趣与风暴巨人相似，所以他的大多数追随者都是这种类型的。",
	"Similar statements can be made about the other five brothers. Most cloud giants revere Memnor, for example, but many reject him because of his deceitfulness and venerate Stronmaus instead. A storm giant living amid blizzards and icebergs in the far northern sea might pay homage to Thrym rather than to Stronmaus. Giants that have given up hope of rising in the ordning sometimes worship Vaprak the Destroyer, who is recognized by giants as the father of trolls and ogres. Giants don't worship male deities exclusively, either. Annam's mate Othea, Hiatea the huntress and home warden, Iallanis the goddess of love and peace, and Diancastra, an impetuous and arrogant trickster, have substantial followings. Like humans, some giants even fall prey to demon cults, in which they pay homage to a demon lord such as Baphomet or Kostchtchie. Worshiping such entities, or any non-giant deity, is considered a great sin against the ordning. Being discovered means being cast out from family and clan.": "关于其他五位兄弟也可以有类似的说法。例如，大多数云雾巨人都崇敬梅姆诺，但许多人因为他的欺骗性而拒绝他，转而崇敬斯特龙马斯。生活在遥远的北海的暴风雪和冰山中的风暴巨人可能会向特里姆致敬，而不是向斯特龙马斯致敬。放弃了在秩序中崛起的希望的巨人有时会崇拜毁灭者瓦普拉克，巨人认为他是巨魔和食人魔的父亲。巨人也不完全崇拜男性神灵。安南的配偶奥赛亚、女猎手和家庭监护人希阿提亚、爱与和平女神伊拉尼斯，以及冲动而傲慢的骗子戴安卡斯特拉，都有大量的追随者。像人类一样，一些巨人甚至成为恶魔崇拜的牺牲品，他们向诸如巴弗梅特或科斯特奇这样的恶魔领主表示敬意。崇拜这样的实体，或者任何非巨人的神灵，都被认为是对教会的巨大罪过。被发现意味着被从家庭和宗族中驱逐出去。",
	"The language that giants share is one of the few remnants from their once-grand empire. Over time it has fragmented into many dialects, and each type has its own distinctive accent, but giants of different types can generally understand one another.": "巨人共享的语言是他们曾经的大帝国为数不多的遗留物之一。随着时间的推移，它已经分裂成许多方言，每种类型都有自己独特的口音，但不同类型的巨人一般都能相互理解。",
	"Any non-giant who learns the Giant language can converse with all types of giants, but giants sometimes have a hard time hearing the tiny voices of human-sized creatures, and some vowel sounds emitted by giants are nearly impossible to reproduce for any creature that doesn't have lungs as large as beer barrels.": "任何学会巨人语言的非巨人都可以与所有类型的巨人交谈，但巨人有时很难听到人类大小的生物的微小声音，而且巨人发出的一些元音对于任何肺部没有啤酒桶那么大的生物来说几乎不可能再现。",
	"Two words have special significance in the Giant language  and the giants' worldview. Neither one of them translates directly into Common or any other language, because their definitions encompass several related concepts. {@b Maat} (pronounced mott) is the term giants use to describe ideas, behaviors, creatures, and objects that they consider good, holy, honorable, or desirable. {@b Maug} (pronounced mog) is the counterpart term, embodying what other languages call evil, unholy, dishonorable, or undesirable.": "有两个词在巨人的语言和巨人的世界观中具有特殊意义。它们中的任何一个都不能直接翻译成普通语言或任何其他语言，因为它们的定义包含了几个相关的概念。{@b Maat}（读作mott）是巨人用来描述他们认为好的、神圣的、光荣的或理想的想法、行为、生物和物体的术语。{@b Maug}（读作mog）是一个对应的术语，体现了其他语言所称的邪恶、不神圣、不光彩或不可取。",
	"Individual giants aren't necessarily thought of as maat or maug by their kin. What matters isn't a giant's personal philosophy but its standing within the ordning, which is influenced by behavior and attitude but also by a host of other factors. Every individual commits both maat and maug acts, and rises or falls in the ordning as a consequence. A giant isn't judged by other giants on the basis of whether what it did was inherently good or evil, but on whether its actions enhanced or diminished the qualities giants admire-the \"giantness,\" if you will-in themselves and their clans.": "巨人个人并不一定被他们的亲属认为是maat或mag。重要的不是一个巨人的个人哲学，而是它在军团中的地位，它受行为和态度的影响，也受许多其他因素的影响。每个人都会做出 \"马特 \"和 \"马格 \"的行为，并因此而在军团中上升或下降。一个巨人被其他巨人评判的依据不是它所做的事情本身是好是坏，而是它的行为是否提高或降低了巨人所欣赏的品质--\"巨人性\"，如果你愿意的话。",
	"A storm giant, for example, might see the raiding practices of hill giants as distasteful but not maug, because brutal raiding is an inborn trait of the hill giants. If those same hill giants worshiped Yeenoghu, however, that act would represent a flagrant turning away from the traditions  of the ordning. Hill giants who choose that path make themselves maug.": "例如，一个风暴巨人可能会认为山地巨人的突袭行为令人厌恶，但并不妨碍他们的行为，因为残酷的突袭是山地巨人与生俱来的特征。然而，如果这些山地巨人崇拜Yeenoghu，那么这种行为就代表着公然背离军团的传统。选择这条道路的山地巨人使他们自己成为了毛利人。",

	"For much of their written communication, giants use a modified version of the runic letterforms claimed by the dwarves as their own. This alphabet is used widely today, including by many traditional enemies of the dwarves such as orcs, giants, and goblinoids. That giants were first in the world and thus the creators of the script is a fact that giants take for granted but which dwarves hotly dispute.": "在大部分的书面交流中，巨人使用被矮人宣称为他们自己的符文字母的修改版。这种字母表今天被广泛使用，包括许多矮人的传统敌人，如兽人、巨人和妖精。巨人是世界上第一个出现的人，因此也是文字的创造者，这是一个巨人认为理所当然的事实，但矮人却对此提出了强烈的异议。",
	"Many giants are illiterate or nearly so-particularly hill, frost, and fire giants, which place little value on learning. Instead of writing stories with words, they typically tell their tales with pictograms etched in wood, ice, stone, or even earth, in the case of hill giants. These \"tale carvings\" relate legends or the stories of important events or meetings in the manner of highly sophisticated cave paintings. Often they employ aspects of legends about the giant pantheon. For example, Memnor's face or head floating above the shoulders of another giant indicates that the giant was a liar or a deceiver; a depiction of Iallanis being stabbed in the back represents the betrayal of love. Such symbols and visual allegories are well understood by giants, but they can be indecipherable to viewers who aren't steeped in the giants' mythology. Most non-giants find a tale carving as unintelligible as giants would find poetry written in Elvish.": "许多巨人都是文盲或几乎是文盲--特别是山丘巨人、冰霜巨人和火巨人，他们对学习不重视。他们通常不用文字来写故事，而是用刻在木头、冰、石头上的象形文字来讲述他们的故事，如果是山地巨人们，甚至是用土。这些 \"故事雕刻 \"以高度复杂的洞穴壁画的方式讲述传说或重要事件或会议的故事。它们通常采用关于巨人神殿的传说的某些方面。例如，Memnor的脸或头漂浮在另一个巨人的肩膀上，表示这个巨人是个骗子或欺骗者；对Iallanis被刺中背部的描绘表示对爱情的背叛。这样的符号和视觉寓意对巨人来说是很好理解的，但对那些没有浸淫在巨人神话中的观众来说，他们可能无法理解。大多数非巨人发现故事雕刻就像巨人发现用精灵语写的诗歌一样无法理解。",

	"Giants have a paradoxical relationship with magic. The most outwardly magical are the cloud giants, followed closely by storm giants. Both types have an innate ability to use some forms of magic related to air, weather, and gravity. Very few giants, however, study magic in the way that humans, dwarves, and elves do. Arcane scholarship by itself isn't acknowledged by the ordning; it isn't maug, but it isn't maat, either. Mastering the secrets of magic, though, demands a degree of devotion that would take giants away from pursuits that are valued by the ordning. As a consequence, it's a path rarely taken.": "巨人与魔法有一种矛盾的关系。最具外在魔力的是云巨人，紧随其后的是风暴巨人。这两种类型都有一种与生俱来的能力，可以使用一些与空气、天气和重力有关的魔法形式。然而，很少有巨人会像人类、矮人和精灵那样研究魔法。奥术学术本身并不被军团所承认；它不是Maug，但也不是maat。不过，掌握魔法的秘密需要一定程度的奉献，这将使巨人远离那些被军团所重视的追求。因此，这是一条很少有人走的路。",
	"The exception is rune magic. Giants are drawn to the solidity and permanence of magical runes. Stone giants are great practitioners of rune carving, both because of the artistry it demands and because their environment is perfect for its use. At least a few skiltgravr (\"rune cutters\") can be found among any type of giants, even the slow-witted hill giants who stomp enormous marks into hillsides or gouge them into their own flesh.": "符文魔法是个例外。巨人被魔法符文的稳固性和持久性所吸引。石头巨人是符文雕刻的伟大实践者，这既是因为它需要艺术性，也因为他们的环境非常适合使用它。在任何类型的巨人中都能找到至少几个skiltgravr（\"符文切割者\"），即使是头脑迟钝的山地巨人，他们也会在山坡上踩出巨大的痕迹，或者把它们抠进自己的肉里。",
	"Crafting this form of magic is painstakingly slow. Imagine a wizard who crafts a scroll and who eschews the convenience of parchment and ink in favor of stone and chisel, glacier and axe, or iron and forge.": "制作这种形式的魔法是痛苦而缓慢的。想象一下一个制作卷轴的巫师，他放弃了羊皮纸和墨水的便利，而选择了石头和凿子，冰川和斧头，或者铁和锻刀。",
	"Carving a magical rune into an item imbues it with power. Like any other magic item, it can be used to activate one or more magical effects. A magical rune can also be inscribed upon a surface to create effects similar to those of a glyph of warding or symbol spell. The rune itself determines what sort of magic the item or surface holds. For example, a storm rune carved into a stone might allow the stone's possessor to control the weather. The same rune carved into door or chest might deal thunder damage to anyone who opens it.": "将魔法符文刻在物品上会赋予它力量。像其他魔法物品一样，它可以被用来激活一个或多个魔法效果。魔法符文也可以刻在一个表面上，以创造类似于守护字形或符号咒语的效果。符文本身决定了该物品或表面拥有什么样的魔法。例如，刻在石头上的风暴符文可能允许石头的拥有者控制天气。同样的符文刻在门或箱子上可能会对打开它的人造成雷霆伤害。",
	"A giant on the move always has a sack slung over its shoulder. The primary purpose of a giant's bag is to carry food. With such an enormous belly to feed (particularly in the case of hill giants), it's unwise for a giant to travel without a supply of nourishment.": "一个移动中的巨人总是在肩上挂着一个麻袋。巨人的袋子的主要目的是为了携带食物。由于要养活如此巨大的肚子（尤其是山地巨人），巨人在旅行时没有营养品供应是不明智的。",
	"Giants also carry rocks in their bags: a few for battle, a few others for hunting, and one or two special ones for games. Beyond that, a bag might contain anything: tools, mementos, items for trade, or merely curios the giant wanted to bring along. Some possible contents are:": "巨人的包里也带着石头：一些用于战斗，一些用于打猎，还有一两个用于游戏的特殊石头。除此之外，袋子里可能包含任何东西：工具、纪念品、交易物品，或者仅仅是巨人想带的奇珍异宝。一些可能的内容是。",

	"Giants have a well-deserved reputation as living siege engines-all of them can hurl boulders with accuracy across great distances. Rock throwing-for battle, hunting, and sport-is a tradition that goes back to the ancient times of the giants. Other races developed the sling, the spear-thrower, or the bow to artificially improve the strength and accuracy of their ranged attacks, but giants never perceived a need for mechanical assistance. Even in places where giants have adapted bows or javelins for use in combat, they've never neglected the straightforward strategy of picking up a rock and letting it fly. Few activities, in fact, seem to give them as much satisfaction as the simple act of tossing boulders.": "巨人作为活的攻城器械有着当之无愧的声誉--他们都能将巨石准确地投掷到很远的地方。为战斗、狩猎和运动而投掷石块是一种传统，可以追溯到巨人的古代时代。其他种族开发了吊索、投矛器或弓箭，以人为地提高他们远程攻击的强度和准确性，但巨人从未意识到对机械援助的需要。即使在那些巨人将弓或标枪用于战斗的地方，他们也从未忽视过捡起一块石头让它飞起来的直接策略。事实上，很少有活动能像投掷巨石这种简单的行为一样让他们感到满足。",
	"Most of the games that giants play involve throwing rocks in ways that hone their skills for hunting and war. One of the most popular contests, especially among fire giants, involves nothing more than taking turns trying to knock each other down with boulders. Frost giants build targets out of snow and ice and compete to see who can knock down the most with a single toss. A popular one-on-one game begins with the challenger throwing a stone as far as it can. The giant who was challenged then goes to where the stone landed and hurls it back at the challenger. A challenger who is stronger wins, because the return throw will fall short, but a giant who took on a better thrower will stumble away, nursing its injuries, as a lesson that arrogance has a price.": "巨人玩的大多数游戏都涉及到投掷石块的方式，以磨练他们的狩猎和战争技能。最受欢迎的比赛之一，特别是在火巨人之间，无非是轮流用巨石击倒对方。霜巨人用雪和冰建造目标，比赛看谁能在一次抛掷中击倒最多的目标。一个流行的一对一游戏开始时，挑战者将石头扔得最远。然后被挑战的巨人走到石头落地的地方，把它扔回给挑战者。一个更强壮的挑战者获胜，因为他的回投会落空，但一个面对更好的投掷者的巨人会跌跌撞撞地离开，护理自己的伤口，作为一个教训，傲慢是有代价的。",
	"In battle against puny creatures, giants use boulders that fit in one hand. When giants fight enormous foes (such as dragons) or enormous targets (such as castles), they prefer to hurl stones so large that even a giant must use both arms to lift and throw one. Giants throw just as accurately with both arms as with one, a feat most humans would find impossible. These attacks are effective only at shorter ranges, however, for obvious reasons.": "在与弱小生物的战斗中，巨人使用适合一只手的巨石。当巨人与巨大的敌人（如龙）或巨大的目标（如城堡）作战时，他们更喜欢投掷大石头，即使是巨人也必须用双臂才能举起和投掷。巨人用双臂投掷和用单臂投掷一样准确，大多数人类会觉得这是不可能的。然而，由于明显的原因，这些攻击只在较短的范围内有效。",
	"When they hunt by rock throwing, giants use smaller stones, about the size of a human head, that can kill an elk or a bear without smashing it into pulp.": "当他们用扔石头的方式打猎时，巨人使用较小的石头，大约人头大小，可以杀死麋鹿或熊，而不会把它砸成肉酱。",
	"A force allied with giants-or worse, a force made up of giants-is one of the most fearsome opponents on the battlefield. The giants can rain boulders onto an enemy from a distance where only skilled archers, heavy siege weapons, or spellcasters can strike back at them.": "与巨人结盟的部队，或者更糟糕的是，由巨人组成的部队，是战场上最可怕的对手之一。巨人可以从远处向敌人投下巨石，只有熟练的弓箭手、重型攻城武器或施法者才能对他们进行反击。",
	"At first blush, it might seem that a potent wizard would make the best giant-killer, but few spellcasters can stand up to a giant in direct confrontation. One might do harm to a giant, but odds are it will survive the one or two spells that can be thrown at it before a well-placed boulder or the swing of an enormous club quashes the threat.": "乍一看，似乎一个强大的巫师会成为最好的巨人杀手，但很少有施法者能在直接对抗中对抗巨人。一个人可能会对巨人造成伤害，但在一块位置良好的巨石或一根巨大的棍子挥动之前，它有可能在一两个法术的打击下幸存。",
	"Among those with experience fighting giants, dwarves have developed the most effective tactics. To defeat a giant, dwarves rely on prolonged, accurate, massed archery (favoring heavy crossbows for such work), fast-moving cavalry that can force the giant into a disadvantageous position, or fanatical troops armed with pole arms, ropes, and grappling hooks. If a giant can be tripped or pulled down-preferably onto its belly so it's less able to defend itself-then it can be entangled in nets and cables and disabled by concentrated attacks on its head and neck.": "在那些有与巨人作战经验的人中，矮人已经发展出最有效的战术。为了打败巨人，矮人依靠的是长时间的、精确的、大规模的射箭（偏重于重型弩箭），快速移动的骑兵可以迫使巨人处于不利的位置，或者用杆臂、绳索和抓钩装备的狂热的部队。如果一个巨人能被绊倒或拉倒--最好是拉到肚子上，这样它的自卫能力就会减弱--那么它就能被网和缆绳缠住，并通过集中攻击它的头部和颈部而致残。",
	"On the other side of the field, giants understand that smaller foes will try to target their legs and lower bodies. Thus, when they head into a fight against human-sized opponents, they don thick boots, greaves, armored codpieces, and wide, heavy hide or metal belts to protect their bellies. Even savage hill giants peel thick bark from trees and strap it around their legs and dangle logs or stones from their belts to make the going more perilous for an enemy that tries to get underfoot.": "在战场的另一边，巨人明白，较小的敌人会试图瞄准他们的腿和下半身。因此，当他们与人类大小的对手作战时，他们会穿上厚厚的靴子，穿上长袍，戴上盔甲，用宽而重的皮革或金属腰带来保护自己的腹部。即使是野蛮的山地巨人也会从树上剥下厚厚的树皮，绑在腿上，并在腰带上挂上木头或石头，使试图踩在脚下的敌人走得更危险。",
	"Giants are exceptionally long-lived compared to humans, but none are immortal. A peaceful death from old age is a common occurrence among cloud giants and storm giants and isn't unusual among stone giants and fire giants. It's the exception among hill giants and frost giants, most of which die violently in battle against humans, dragons, other monsters, or their own kind.": "与人类相比，巨人的寿命特别长，但没有人是不朽的。在云巨人和风暴巨人中，因年老而和平死亡是一种常见的现象，在石巨人和火巨人中也并不罕见。这在山丘巨人和冰霜巨人中是个例外，他们大多在与人类、龙、其他怪物或同类的战斗中暴毙。",
	"Giants live at a slower pace than humans do. In the space of four heartbeats for a man, a stone giant's great heart beats just once. Giant mothers stay with their child for longer than human mothers do, and giant children grow to adulthood more slowly. Giants' families are small, because a couple seldom has more than a few children, and many have none at all.": "巨人的生活节奏比人类要慢。在一个人四次心跳的时间里，石巨人的巨大心脏只跳动一次。巨人的母亲与他们的孩子在一起的时间比人类的母亲要长，巨人的孩子成长为成年人的速度也更慢。巨人的家庭很小，因为一对夫妇很少有超过几个孩子，许多人根本就没有孩子。",
	"The life spans of the various types of giants are generally in keeping with their place in the ordning; the lowliest giants have the shortest life spans, and the noblest giants are the longest-lived. Stone giants are the exception. Because of their long life spans, despite their low position in the ordning, other giants consider stone giants to be the wisest of all giant types, just as Skoraeus Stonebones is often seen as the wisest of all the giant gods.": "各种类型的巨人的寿命通常与他们在秩序中的地位相一致；最低级的巨人的寿命最短，而最高贵的巨人则最长寿。石头巨人是个例外。由于他们的寿命很长，尽管他们在军团中的地位很低，其他巨人认为石巨人是所有巨人类型中最聪明的，就像斯科雷斯-石骨经常被视为所有巨神中最聪明的。",

A select few-those at the apex of the clan's ordning-claim the last of the ancient cloud castles that still drift across the sky.": "云中巨人的名字很贴切，或者至少曾经是。他们中很少有人真正生活在云上，但大多数人确实居住在高山之上，在近乎永久的云层内甚至之上。少数人--那些处于氏族秩序顶点的人--声称拥有最后的古老云堡，这些云堡仍然在天空中飘荡。",
	"No one can build those majestic structures any longer. The methods of their construction were lost (along with much other knowledge) when Ostoria fell. Some cloud giants believe the information might yet be buried in some long-forgotten, ruined library. Rumors of its existence crop up from time to time, stirring debate and dreams of resurgent glory among the cloud giants, but definite information has proven impossible to obtain. Many cloud giants think that someday, a hero will unearth this ancient secret. Until then, they must be satisfied with watching clouds drift past their mountaintop  homes instead of living atop those clouds as in days of yore.": "没有人能够再建造这些雄伟的建筑。它们的建造方法在奥斯托利亚陷落时丢失了（连同许多其他知识）。一些云端的巨人相信，这些信息可能还埋藏在某个早已被遗忘的废墟图书馆中。关于它存在的传言不时出现，在云端巨人中激起了辩论和复兴荣耀的梦想，但事实证明不可能获得确切的信息。许多云端巨人认为，总有一天，一个英雄会揭开这个古老的秘密。在那之前，他们必须满足于看着云彩飘过他们的山顶家园，而不是像过去那样生活在云彩之上。",
	"Most types of giants live communally in large groups of clan mates, but the central unit of cloud giant life is the family-a mated pair, their offspring (if any), and perhaps a couple of close relatives. Cloud giants prefer not to congregate in great numbers in any one place, to avoid drawing too much attention. It's not that they fear attack from humanoids or monsters, because few creatures other than dragons can challenge them. But if more than a few lived in the same place, the size of their combined treasure hoard would attract an incessant stream of adventurers and other would-be thieves-a nuisance on the order of rats in the larder.": "大多数类型的巨人都生活在由氏族伴侣组成的大群体中，但云巨人生活的核心单位是家庭--一对交配的夫妇、他们的后代（如果有的话），也许还有几个近亲。云巨人不喜欢在任何一个地方大量聚集，以避免引起太多的注意。这并不是说他们害怕来自人类或怪物的攻击，因为除了龙以外，很少有生物可以挑战他们。但是，如果在同一个地方住的人多了，他们的财宝囤积量就会吸引源源不断的冒险家和其他可能的盗贼--就像储藏室里的老鼠一样令人讨厌。",
	"Despite the distances that separate the homes of families, cloud giants aren't isolated. Every family or individual knows where its nearest neighbors are, even if the location is hundreds of miles away, and those neighbors know where their nearest neighbors are, and so on across the world. In a crisis, word is spread from family to family, so that a mighty squad of cloud giants could be assembled, in time, if need arises.": "尽管家庭之间的距离很远，但云巨人并不是孤立的。每个家庭或个人都知道其最近的邻居在哪里，即使位置在几百英里之外，而这些邻居也知道他们最近的邻居在哪里，以此类推，遍布全球。在危机中，消息从一个家庭传到另一个家庭，因此，如果有需要，可以及时召集一支强大的云端巨人队伍。",
	"Most cloud giant homes include one or more pets. Wyverns, griffons, giant eagles and owls, and other beasts of the sky are popular choices. Pets aren't limited to flying creatures, though. Any sort of creature might be found in a cloud giant menagerie, with rare specimens treated more as status symbol than as companions.": "大多数云中巨人的家包括一个或多个宠物。怀俄明，狮鹫，巨鹰和猫头鹰，以及其他天空中的野兽都是受欢迎的选择。不过，宠物并不局限于飞行生物。任何种类的生物都可以在云巨人的动物园里找到，稀有的标本更多的是作为地位的象征，而不是作为伙伴。",
	"Cloud giants are famous (or infamous) for demanding tribute from the humanoids that live beneath them. Such tribute is only proper from their perspective, for two reasons. First, their presence in an area benefits everyone by driving away many evils, especially flying predators such as manticores and wyverns. Second, the giants believe they deserve to be rewarded for their forbearance; no one could stop them from simply taking what they want, but instead of doing that they allow their tribute to be freely given. (The logic of that position is clearer to the giants than it is to those on the other end of the arrangement.)": "云巨人因要求生活在他们下面的人类进贡而闻名（或臭名昭著）。从他们的角度来看，这种进贡是恰当的，原因有二。首先，他们在一个地区的存在对每个人都有好处，因为他们赶走了许多邪恶的东西，特别是飞行掠食者，如尾兽和狼獾。第二，巨人认为他们的宽容应该得到回报；没有人可以阻止他们简单地拿走他们想要的东西，但他们没有这样做，而是让他们的贡品免费提供。(这一立场的逻辑对巨人来说比对安排的另一端的人更清楚）。",
	"Much of the tribute that cloud giants accept is in the form of livestock and crops, but this isn't their only source of food. Cloud giants are avid gardeners. Almost all cloud giant strongholds devote space to a garden that produces enormous yields: beans as big as turnips, turnips as big as pumpkins, and pumpkins as big as carriages.": "云巨人接受的大部分贡品是以牲畜和农作物的形式，但这并不是他们唯一的食物来源。云巨人是狂热的园艺家。几乎所有的云雾巨人据点都将空间用于生产巨大产量的花园：像萝卜一样大的豆子，像南瓜一样大的萝卜，和像马车一样大的南瓜。",
	"The garden of a cloud giant family is seldom affected by drought, frost, or locusts. When such a calamity strikes nearby farms, families have been known to share their bounty to ease the humanoids' food shortage.": "云巨人家庭的花园很少受到干旱、霜冻或蝗虫的影响。当这种灾难袭击附近的农场时，人们知道家庭会分享他们的赏赐，以缓解人类的食物短缺。",
	"The chief deity of cloud giants is Memnor, the cleverest of Annam's offspring. But Memnor isn't only clever, he's sly and deceitful. Tales of his exploits emphasize his charisma, his smooth manner, and his ability to manipulate and mislead his siblings and other legendary figures into doing exactly what he wants, usually to their great detriment.": "云巨人的主要神灵是梅姆诺，他是安南最聪明的后代。但梅姆诺尔不仅聪明，而且狡猾、奸诈。有关他的故事强调了他的魅力、他的圆滑，以及他操纵和误导他的兄弟姐妹和其他传奇人物做他想做的事的能力，通常对他们造成极大的伤害。",
	"Thus, cloud giants have two distinct aspects of Memnor to admire and emulate. Those of a benign disposition revere him for his charm, intelligence, and persuasiveness, while those of a more malign bent take Memnor's self-interest to heart and imitate his trickery. Cloud giants that take a particular interest in trickery, known as \"smiling ones,\" wear two-faced masks as they practice their deceptions and prey on those who are susceptible to their charms. Statistics for cloud giant smiling ones appear in chapter 3 of this book.": "因此，云中巨人对梅姆诺有两种截然不同的钦佩和效仿。那些性格善良的人崇尚他的魅力、智慧和说服力，而那些性格比较恶毒的人则把梅姆诺尔的自我利益放在心上，模仿他的诡计。对诡计特别感兴趣的云巨人，被称为 \"微笑者\"，他们戴着两面的面具进行欺骗，并捕食那些容易受其魅力影响的人。本书第三章中出现了关于云雾巨人微笑者的统计数字。",
	"Such events are at the root of tales about magic beans and others about a human family living in a cottage carved from a single, enormous gourd. Beyond that, the cloud giants' generosity in times of want helps to cement their reputation as friends of humankind-a reputation that serves them well, even though it's not entirely deserved.": "这类事件是关于魔豆的故事的根源，也是关于一个人类家庭生活在由一个巨大的葫芦雕刻而成的小屋的故事的根源。除此之外，云雾巨人在匮乏时期的慷慨帮助巩固了他们作为人类朋友的声誉--这种声誉对他们很有利，尽管这并不是完全应得的。",
	"A cloud giant's position within the ordning doesn't depend on talent or skill. It depends on wealth. The more treasure a cloud giant possesses, the higher its standing. It's as simple as that. Almost.": "一个云计算巨人在条例中的地位并不取决于天赋或技能。它取决于财富。一个云端巨人拥有的财富越多，其地位就越高。就这么简单。差不多了。",
	"Ownership is one thing, but wealth that's kept locked away means little. To fully contribute to one's status, wealth must be displayed, and the more ostentatious the display, the better. In a cloud giant family's home, extravagance is omnipresent. One might boast windows framed in gold leaf, rare perfume stored in vials of crystal with silver lids, or a scene in the sky depicted in a tapestry composed entirely of pearls.": "拥有权是一回事，但被锁起来的财富没有什么意义。为了充分提升自己的地位，财富必须被展示出来，而且展示得越夸张越好。在一个云端巨人的家里，奢侈是无处不在的。人们可能会夸耀用金叶子镶成的窗户，稀有的香水储存在带银盖的水晶瓶中，或者用完全由珍珠组成的挂毯描绘天空中的场景。",
	"Another way for a family to demonstrate its wealth is by bestowing lavish gifts on other families. (A gift from one family member to another doesn't prove anything about the family's largesse.) No cloud giant truly believes that it's better to give than to receive; a family does so only with an eye toward how the giving can elevate its status. Memnor and his trickery play a role in this \"game.\" The very best gift (from the giver's perspective) is one that everyone believes to be far more valuable than it truly is. Only the giver and the receiver will ever know a gift's true value, and neither of them would ever reveal that a gift is worth less than it appears to be, because to do so would reduce the status of both.": "一个家庭展示其财富的另一种方式是向其他家庭赠送奢华的礼物。(一个家庭成员给另一个成员的礼物并不能证明这个家庭的慷慨。） 没有一个云端的巨人真正相信施比受更好；一个家庭这样做只是为了考虑如何通过给予来提高自己的地位。梅姆诺尔和他的诡计在这个 \"游戏 \"中扮演了一个角色。最好的礼物（从赠送者的角度来看）是每个人都认为比它真正的价值高得多的礼物。只有送礼人和收礼人知道一份礼物的真正价值，他们都不会透露一份礼物的价值低于它看起来的价值，因为这样做会降低两人的地位。",
	"Wealth also changes hands between cloud giants when they indulge their obsession for gambling and wagering. Cloud giants don't engage in betting for enjoyment; it is less a form of entertainment than a type of bloodless feud. No cloud giant is a good loser, and one would be aghast to hear someone else say, \"I lost 40 pounds of gold, but I had a good time.\" Betting wars between families can go on for generations, with fortunes and estates (and the position in the ordning that goes with them) passing back and forth repeatedly. What a parent loses, a child hopes someday to win back, plus more; what the child wins back, a grandchild probably will eventually lose again. The tales that cloud giants tell of their ancestors are seldom about wars or magic or battles against dragons-they're about brilliant wagers won through boldness or deceit, and rival families brought to disgrace and ruin by the same.": "当云端巨人沉迷于赌博和下注时，财富也在他们之间易手。云雾巨人参与赌博并不是为了享受；与其说这是一种娱乐，不如说是一种不流血的争斗。没有一个云雾巨人是好的输家，如果听到别人说：\"我输了40磅黄金，但我玩得很开心\"，人们会感到惊奇。家庭之间的赌战可以持续几代人，财富和财产（以及与之相伴的在军团中的地位）反复传递。父母失去的东西，孩子希望有一天能赢回来，再加上更多；孩子赢回来的东西，孙子可能最终会再次失去。云端巨人讲述他们祖先的故事，很少是关于战争、魔法或与龙的战斗--它们是关于通过大胆或欺骗赢得的辉煌赌注，以及竞争对手的家族因同样的事情而蒙羞和毁灭。",
	"Ancient depictions of Memnor often showed him wearing a two-faced mask. Because of this, cloud giant nobles seldom show their faces, but instead wear exquisite masks made of precious materials adorned with gemstones. Each noble has a collection of these masks that it wears to conceal its face but still reflect its current mood; an individual might change masks many times during the day as its emotions shift.": "古代对梅姆诺尔的描绘经常显示他戴着两面的面具。正因为如此，云巨人贵族很少露出他们的脸，而是戴着用宝石装饰的珍贵材料制成的精致面具。每个贵族都有一套这样的面具，戴着它可以掩盖自己的脸，但仍能反映其当前的心情；一个人在一天中可能会随着情绪的变化而多次更换面具。"
