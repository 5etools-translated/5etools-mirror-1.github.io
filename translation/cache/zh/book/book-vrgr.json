	"A scream shatters the still gloom. Inhuman shapes slip between crumbling tombs. The shadows reach forth. Do instincts and imagination conspire against you? Or have otherworldly evils claimed you, drawing you into the mists of Ravenloft?": "一声尖叫打破了寂静的阴霾。非人的身影在坍塌的墓穴间滑过。阴影伸向前方。本能和想象力在密谋对付你吗？或者是其他世界的邪恶占据了你，把你拉进拉文洛夫特的迷雾中？",
	"In hidden corners of the Shadowfell are nightmare domains that hunger for the brave and the innocent, the ambitious and the wicked. Some call this collection of eerie realms the Land of the Mists, but monster hunters know it as Ravenloft. Terror, magic, mystery, and suspense fill these fractured domains, an infinite gallery of unfolding evils, age-old plots, cursed bloodlines, legendary monsters, and immortal villains. Evildoers from countless worlds regard Ravenloft as their prison—infamous figures such as the lich-king Azalin Rex, the unscrupulous scientist Viktra Mordenheim, and the diabolical first vampire Strahd von Zarovich. These Darklords wield incredible power within their isolated domains, yet they're held captive in eternal torment as victims of malign forces known as the Dark Powers.": "在阴影之城的隐秘角落里，有一些噩梦般的领域，它们渴求着勇敢者和无辜者、野心家和邪恶者。有些人把这个阴森恐怖的国度称为 \"迷雾之地\"，但怪物猎人却把它称为 \"雷文洛夫特\"。恐怖、魔法、神秘和悬念充斥着这些支离破碎的领域，这是一个无限的画廊，里面有正在展开的邪恶、古老的阴谋、受诅咒的血统、传奇的怪物和不朽的恶棍。来自无数世界的邪恶之徒将雷文洛夫特视为他们的监狱，著名的人物包括巫妖王阿萨林-雷克斯（Azalin Rex）、不择手段的科学家维克特拉-莫登海姆（Viktra Mordenheim）和邪恶的第一吸血鬼斯特拉赫-冯-扎罗维奇（Strahd von Zarovich）。这些黑暗领主在其孤立的领域内拥有令人难以置信的力量，但他们作为被称为黑暗势力的邪恶力量的受害者，被关押在永恒的折磨中。",
	"Ravenloft is a fundamentally magical realm, one that takes its name from its most infamous haunted location, the dreaded Castle Ravenloft in Barovia—home of the notorious Strahd von Zarovich. In this mysterious setting, the land, the passage of time, the tides, and every other reliable truth can shift unpredictably. Rather than being bound by proximity or politics, the lands of Ravenloft—also known as the Domains of Dread—are mist-bound islands drifting through the boundless gloom of the Shadowfell. Innumerable domains lie hidden within these supernatural mists, and of these secret realms, the most terrifying are those born of your nightmares and given grim life through your adventures.": "拉文洛夫特是一个基本的魔幻王国，它的名字来自于其最臭名昭著的闹鬼地点--位于巴罗维亚的可怕的拉文洛夫特城堡--臭名昭著的斯特拉赫-冯-扎罗维奇。在这个神秘的环境中，土地、时间的流逝、潮汐和其他所有可靠的事实都会发生不可预知的变化。拉文洛夫特（Ravenloft）的土地--也被称为恐惧之域--不是被距离或政治所束缚，而是被雾气所束缚的岛屿，在阴影之城的无边阴暗中漂流。在这些超自然的迷雾中隐藏着无数的领域，而在这些秘密的领域中，最可怕的是那些从你的噩梦中诞生的，并通过你的冒险赋予其严峻的生命。",
	"Although Ravenloft is a setting of storied evils, the domains aren't without heroes. Brave souls such as the investigator Ez d'Avenir, the monster-hunting Weathermay-Foxgrove sisters, and the scholar Rudolph van Richten explore the domains' secrets. Though few in number, such adventurers represent defiant lights that shine like beacons through the darkness, and characters from all lands and worlds may be eager—or compelled—to challenge the sinister forces lurking in the shadows.": "虽然Ravenloft是一个充满邪恶传说的环境，但该领域并不是没有英雄。勇敢的灵魂，如调查员Ez d'Avenir、猎杀怪物的Weathermay-Foxgrove姐妹，以及学者Rudolph van Richten，都在探索这片领域的秘密。虽然数量不多，但这样的冒险家代表着像灯塔一样照亮黑暗的反抗之光，来自所有土地和世界的角色都可能渴望或被迫挑战潜伏在阴影中的邪恶力量。",

	"We continue our pursuit of that were-wretch, Natalia Vhorishkova. Before she fled our last confrontation, she shed a cord threaded through a wolf's tooth. Laurie used the talisman as you and Uncle George taught us, and it guided us through the Mists to Skald, a quaint, music-loving place in a land called Kartakass. The folk here are hospitable. Fawning actually. They hang on our every word. I've escaped their attentions by sequestering myself in our room at a local taverna while Laurie overindulges in attention for both of us. We've found no trace of Vhorishkova since arriving, but I feel her watching. It's like she's everywhere.": "我们继续追捕那个卑鄙小人，纳塔利娅-弗里什科娃。在她逃离我们的最后一次对抗之前，她流下了一根穿在狼牙上的绳子。劳里按照你和乔治叔叔教给我们的方法使用了这个护身符，它引导我们穿过迷雾，来到斯卡尔德，一个古色古香、热爱音乐的地方，叫做卡塔卡斯。这里的人很好客。实际上是献媚。他们对我们的每句话都很关注。我把自己关在当地一家小酒馆的房间里，躲避他们的关注，而劳里则为我们两个人过度关注。自从到达后，我们没有发现霍里什科娃的踪迹，但我感觉到她在监视。好像她无处不在。",

	"The lands and characters of Ravenloft don't share a planet. Rather, the Domains of Dread consist of innumerable demiplanes hidden amid the Plane of Shadow. Mysterious Mists surround each of these island-realms. The bravest souls might creep from one domain to another, but doing so involves considerable danger, and many who enter the Mists are never seen again.": "拉文洛夫特的土地和人物并不共享一个星球。相反，恐惧之域由隐藏在阴影地带的无数个半位面组成。神秘的迷雾围绕着每一个岛国。最勇敢的灵魂可能会从一个领域爬到另一个领域，但这样做涉及到相当大的危险，许多进入迷雾的人再也没有见过。",
	"Sinister entities known as the Dark Powers manipulate the Domains of Dread and all who dwell within. Immortal, unknowable, and omnipotent, the Dark Powers revel in sowing terror and subtly manipulating their captives over the course of generations.": "被称为黑暗势力的邪恶实体操纵着恐惧之域和所有居住在其中的人。黑暗势力是不朽的、不可知的、无所不能的，他们陶醉于播种恐怖，并在几代人的时间里巧妙地操纵着他们的俘虏。",
	"Ravenloft's demiplanes range in size from solitary structures to vast regions. These domains serve as the prisons of Darklords, villainous beings trapped and tormented by the Dark Powers. The specifics of each domain exist to ironically twist its Darklord's desires, capturing them and their lands' residents in cycles of dread and despair.": "拉文洛夫特的半位面大小不一，从孤独的建筑到广阔的区域。这些领域是黑暗领主的监狱，是被黑暗力量困住并折磨的恶棍。每个领域的具体情况都是为了讽刺地扭曲黑暗领主的欲望，在恐惧和绝望的循环中俘虏他们和他们土地上的居民。",
	"Supernatural haze suffuses the Domains of Dread. These are the Mists of Ravenloft, ominous fogs that gird each domain, rising and falling as the Dark Powers desire. Tales attribute ominous powers to the Mists, from cloaking monsters to causing entire villages to vanish. The Mists are not bound to Ravenloft and slip across the planes, potentially dragging anyone into the Domains of Dread.": "超自然的阴霾笼罩着恐惧之域。这就是拉文洛夫特的迷雾，不祥的雾气笼罩着每个领域，随着黑暗势力的发展而起伏。传说将不祥的力量归于迷雾，从隐身怪物到导致整个村庄消失。迷雾并不拘泥于拉文洛夫特，它在各个星球间游走，可能会把任何人拖入恐惧之域。",
	"The Mists of Ravenloft are notorious for kidnapping innocent souls and trapping them within the Domains of Dread, but they also collect characters to participate in specific terrifying adventures. Ravenloft can claim a soul for one night of terror or for an inescapable nightmare, whichever suits the needs of your adventures.": "拉文洛夫特的迷雾因绑架无辜的灵魂并将他们困在恐惧之域中而臭名昭著，但他们也会收集角色来参与特定的恐怖冒险。拉文洛夫特可以在一个恐怖的夜晚或一个无法逃脱的噩梦中索要一个灵魂，以适合你的冒险的需要为准。",
	"Ravenloft is not a land of heroes. Few seek out danger in the Mists or challenge Darklords. Fear and forces within characters themselves—potentially in the form of rare lineages or Dark Gifts—threaten personal dooms. Yet those who face these terrors shine as lights amid the Mists, beacons to attract other heroes but also greater threats.": "拉文洛夫特并不是一片英雄的土地。很少有人在迷雾中寻找危险或挑战黑暗领主。恐惧和人物自身的力量--可能以稀有血统或黑暗天赋的形式--威胁着个人的末日。然而，那些面对这些恐怖的人在迷雾中闪耀着光芒，是吸引其他英雄的灯塔，也是更大的威胁。",
	"The Domains of Dread provide malleable settings for any kind of horror adventure. As domains are unmoored from conventional reality, anything can happen within their borders. Normal people undergo terrifying transformations, whole villages disappear unnoticed, and the Mists bar every method of escaping a threat. Any surreal development you desire is also the will of the Dark Powers, assuring that the most terrifying possibilities come to pass. As a result, even the most familiar races, magic items, and monsters in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, and {@book Monster Manual|MM} have places in Ravenloft, but with twists that make them creepy or mysterious.": "恐惧之域为任何类型的恐怖冒险提供了可塑的环境。由于领域与传统的现实脱节，任何事情都可能在其边界内发生。正常人会发生可怕的转变，整个村庄会在不知不觉中消失，而迷雾会阻止每一种逃离威胁的方法。你想要的任何超现实的发展也是黑暗势力的意志，确保最可怕的可能性成为现实。因此，即使是{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}、{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}和{@book Monster Manual|MM}中最熟悉的种族、魔法物品和怪物，在《雷文洛夫特》中也有一席之地，但会有一些转折，使它们变得令人毛骨悚然或神秘。",
	"Although the Domains of Dread are dramatically different, certain realities underpin their terrors. The nature of domains, the influence of Darklords, the mysteries of the Mists, and the machinations of the Dark Powers present a wealth of ominous possibilities. All these elements share a shadowy uncertainty and the potential for terror to take on unpredictable forms.": "虽然恐惧之域有很大的不同，但某些现实是其恐怖的基础。领域的性质、黑暗领主的影响、迷雾的奥秘以及黑暗势力的阴谋诡计呈现出大量不祥的可能性。所有这些因素都有一个朦胧的不确定性，以及恐怖的潜在的不可预知的形式。",
	"The following sections are written for you, the DM, to consider and incorporate into your adventures as you see fit. If you wish to reveal the core mysteries of Ravenloft to your players and explore the Land of the Mists with shared knowledge, by all means do so.

	"By the standards of what other worlds' inhabitants consider true and sane, the Domains of Dread don't make sense. The setting's domains don't neatly flow into one another, histories don't record a collectively remembered past, fictions spawn terrible facts, and sheltered villagers remain stubbornly ignorant about the world beyond. Ravenloft is a setting designed to cultivate uncertainty, mystery, paranoia, and dread in defiance of logic or common sense.": "以其他世界的居民认为真实和理智的标准来看，恐惧之域是没有意义的。设定中的领域并不整齐地相互连接，历史并不记录集体记忆中的过去，虚构的东西会产生可怕的事实，而受庇护的村民对外面的世界仍然固执地一无所知。拉文洛夫特是一个旨在培养不确定性、神秘感、偏执狂和无视逻辑或常识的恐惧的设定。",
	"The characters in your Ravenloft adventures might be the first to inquire after obvious inconsistencies or to notice plain impossibilities. But why has no one before them sought answers to such unignorable questions? The Dark Powers, the Mists, and the nature of domains and Darklords all claim part of the answer, but ultimately they reflect aspects of the same cause: nightmare logic.": "你的Ravenloft冒险中的人物可能是第一个询问明显的不一致或注意到明显的不可能的人。但是，为什么在他们之前没有人去寻找这些不可忽视的问题的答案？黑暗势力、迷雾、领域和黑暗领主的性质都要求得到部分答案，但最终它们反映了同一个原因的各个方面：噩梦般的逻辑。",
	"Ravenloft is inherently a vast nightmare. Most of those who experience its terrors never suspect its surreal nature; only a few gradually realize that things don't add up. Whether they do or don't, the setting's supernatural features and malicious masterminds exist to foster terror. The details described in this section are true, but truth is malleable in Ravenloft. The exact limits of the Dark Powers' influence, the Mists' reach, and the Darklords' control over their domains are purposefully vague.": "拉文洛夫特本来就是一个巨大的噩梦。大多数经历过它的恐怖的人从未怀疑它的超现实性质；只有少数人逐渐意识到事情不对劲。无论他们是否有，这个设定的超自然特征和恶意的主谋都是为了制造恐怖。本节描述的细节是真实的，但在雷文洛夫特，真相是可塑的。黑暗势力的影响、迷雾的范围以及黑暗领主对其领域的控制的确切界限是有意模糊的。",
	"As with any nightmare, the Domains of Dread aren't shackled to the laws of reality. Domains exist not to simulate a believable world, but to terrify. This flexibility provides a powerful tool to upend assumptions of safety and tailor your characters' struggles. It also encourages layers of mysteries about the nature of the setting. Is each domain unique or just one in a series of recurring nightmares? How many forms of Castle Ravenloft exist, have existed, and will yet reveal themselves in the Mists? What is truth among the Domains of Dread, and how long will that remain certain? The answers are for you to decide.": "与任何恶梦一样，\"恐惧之域 \"并不受现实法则的束缚。领域的存在不是为了模拟一个可信的世界，而是为了吓唬人。这种灵活性提供了一个强大的工具，可以颠覆安全的假设，并为你的角色定制斗争。它还鼓励对环境的性质进行层层揭秘。每个领域都是独一无二的，还是只是一系列反复出现的噩梦中的一个？拉文洛夫特城堡有多少种形式存在，曾经存在，并将在迷雾中显现出来？恐惧之域中的真相是什么，这一点还能保持多久？答案将由你来决定。",

	"The Dark Powers don't move in the shadows of Ravenloft; they are the shadows. They're the Mists and the darkness.

Ever-present and inscrutable, the Dark Powers are akin to gods in Ravenloft, but they are unknown to mortals and desire no worship.": "黑暗势力并不在雷文洛夫特的阴影中活动，他们就是阴影。他们是迷雾和黑暗。他们是水表现为河流和星星出现在脱离宇宙的天空中的原因。他们是囚禁黑暗领主的看守者。黑暗势力无处不在，高深莫测，在雷文洛夫特类似于神明，但他们不为凡人所知，也不希望受到崇拜。",
	"Despite the control the Dark Powers exert, these beings remain distant from the domains they manipulate. Although some of their names whisper through sinister lore—names like Osybus, Shami-Amourae, and Tenebrous—domain inhabitants know almost nothing of the Dark Powers. While some Darklords realize they're imprisoned by antagonistic entities, discourse regarding the Dark Powers remains the province of soothsayers, obsessed scholars, and otherworldly beings. Anyone who spreads tales of sinister forces manipulating reality is ignored or worse. For residents of Ravenloft, ignorance provides a well-defended shelter against unfathomable truths.": "尽管黑暗势力施加了控制，但这些生命仍然远离他们所操纵的领域。虽然他们的一些名字在险恶的传说中低语--如奥西伯斯（Osybus）、沙米-阿莫拉（Shami-Amourae）和特尼布拉斯（Tenebrous）--但领域内的居民几乎对黑暗力量一无所知。虽然有些黑暗领主意识到他们被敌对的实体所囚禁，但关于黑暗力量的讨论仍然是占卜师、痴迷的学者和其他世界的人的事情。任何传播操纵现实的邪恶力量的故事的人都会被忽视，甚至更糟。对于拉文洛夫特的居民来说，无知为他们提供了一个抵御深不可测的真相的良好庇护。",
	"The true nature of the Dark Powers is for you to decide. How you perceive these forces can influence your view of their actions and agendas, who they abduct into Ravenloft and why. Through your adventures, you might reveal these mysteries and use them to hint at ways to escape the Domains of Dread. Consider the following possibilities when developing your perspective on the Dark Powers:": "黑暗势力的真正性质由你来决定。你如何看待这些力量，可以影响你对他们的行动和议程的看法，他们把谁绑架到拉文洛夫特，以及为什么。通过你的冒险，你可能会揭开这些谜团，并利用它们来暗示逃离恐惧之域的方法。在发展你对黑暗势力的看法时，请考虑以下可能性。",

	"Known throughout Ravenloft, the Mists are manifestations of the Dark Powers' will. They divide, surround, and isolate every domain, creating fog-shrouded borders that imprison Darklords within their territories. The Mists slip through the Domains of Dread, rising to claim unwitting travelers or releasing terrors upon unsuspecting villagers. Most infamously, the Mists slither into other worlds to claim innocents, villains, or whole lands, dragging them back to become the newest prisoners of Ravenloft.": "迷雾在整个拉文洛夫特都很有名，它是黑暗势力意志的体现。它们分割、包围和隔离每一个领域，创造出雾气笼罩的边界，将黑暗领主禁锢在他们的领土内。迷雾在恐惧之域中溜达，升起后夺走不知情的旅行者，或向毫无戒心的村民释放恐怖。最臭名昭著的是，迷雾溜进其他世界，夺取无辜者、恶棍或整个土地，把他们拖回来，成为拉文洛夫特最新的囚犯。",
	"Inhabitants of the Domains of Dread know of the Mists and ascribe sinister stories to them, but they accept the Mists as a natural part of their homeland. Many who travel between domains even refer to their world as the Land of the Mists. Any supernatural happening, inexplicable disappearance, or malicious force can be blamed on the Mists, and those who interact with the Mists or who come from beyond them are met with suspicion. The Mists confound travel between domains, whether one wishes to leave a place to reach another land or to escape the realm they're in.": "恐惧之域的居民知道迷雾，并赋予它们险恶的故事，但他们接受迷雾是他们家园的一个自然组成部分。许多在各域之间旅行的人甚至把他们的世界称为迷雾之国。任何超自然的事件、莫名其妙的消失或恶意的力量都可以归咎于迷雾，而那些与迷雾互动或来自迷雾之外的人都会受到怀疑。迷雾混淆了领域之间的旅行，无论一个人是想离开一个地方到达另一个地方还是想逃离他们所在的领域。",

	"Each domain is surrounded by the Mists, its boundaries fading away into haze. Domains share neither borders nor common geography, and you can't peer from one domain into another. The environments, cultures, and residents of one domain don't influence those of other domains.": "每个领域都被迷雾所包围，其边界渐渐消失在雾气中。各个领域既没有共同的边界，也没有共同的地理环境，你无法从一个领域窥视到另一个领域。一个域的环境、文化和居民不会影响其他域的环境、文化和居民。",

	"Those who run afoul of a Darklord might find that the Mists prevent them from leaving the villain's domain. Like a haunted house that conveniently seals its doors or summons a deadly storm, so do domains create inescapable spaces where horror adventures unfold.": "那些触犯黑暗领主的人可能会发现，迷雾使他们无法离开恶棍的领地。就像鬼屋方便地封住门或召唤出致命的风暴一样，领域也创造了无法逃避的空间，恐怖的冒险在这里展开。",
	"Each domain reflects its Darklord and facilitates horror tales related to that villain. Just as creepy manors suit ghostly inhabitants, so does each domain inspire and encourage a distinct type of terror.": "每个领域都反映了它的黑暗领主，并促进了与该反派有关的恐怖故事。就像令人毛骨悚然的庄园适合幽灵般的居民一样，每个领域都会激发和鼓励一种独特的恐怖类型。",

	"The nature of Ravenloft provides powerful tools to craft tales of terror. Shifting reality, inescapable danger, and foes with shocking powers are useful for creating horror adventures (a topic further discussed in {@book chapter 4|VRGR|4}). As a balancing factor, use these tools judiciously and occasionally, in the characters' favor. The Dark Powers delight in tormenting villains as much as they do innocents, the Mists equally confound both predators and prey, and Darklords frequently exhibit hubris or other exploitable flaws. Use Ravenloft's nature to sow dread but also to inspire hope. Relentless despair gradually beats characters down and takes the fun out of adventures. Punctuate your horror tales with moments of relief, comedy, and fortuitous coincidences. These moments of hope help characters push through the dark to the thrill of dawn.": "拉文洛夫特的性质为制作恐怖故事提供了强有力的工具。变化的现实、无法逃避的危险和拥有令人震惊的力量的敌人对于创造恐怖的冒险是非常有用的（这个话题在{@book chapter 4|VRGR|4}中进一步讨论）。作为一个平衡因素，明智地、偶尔地使用这些工具，对人物有利。黑暗势力喜欢折磨恶棍，就像他们折磨无辜者一样，迷雾同样让捕食者和猎物感到困惑，而黑暗领主经常表现出傲慢或其他可利用的缺陷。利用拉文洛夫特的性质来播种恐惧，同时也激发希望。无情的绝望会逐渐击垮角色，并使冒险的乐趣消失。用解脱、喜剧和偶然的巧合的时刻来补充你的恐怖故事。这些希望的时刻可以帮助人物冲破黑暗，迎接黎明的到来。",
	"Central to each domain is a Darklord, the seed from which a thorny thicket blooms. The villain might be a nation's leader, a prominent citizen, a notorious monster, a mysterious recluse, or a seemingly innocuous character. Regardless of the Darklord's current role, their wickedness led to the creation of their domain and their imprisonment in Ravenloft.": "每个领域的核心是一个黑暗领主，它是荆棘丛生的种子。这个恶棍可能是一个国家的领导人，一个著名的公民，一个臭名昭著的怪物，一个神秘的隐士，或者一个看起来无害的人物。无论黑暗领主目前的角色是什么，他们的邪恶导致了他们的领域的建立和他们在雷文洛夫特的监禁。",

Even death rarely allows a Darklord to escape their prison for long.": "黑暗领主不能离开他们的领地。如果一个黑暗领主进入迷雾或使用其他方法试图逃跑，黑暗势力会将他们送回他们的领域。即使是死亡也很少能让黑暗领主长久地逃离他们的监狱。",

	"Although Darklords hate their domains, they exert considerable control over them. This might be the influence of a governmental leader, the magic of a supernatural overlord, or a more fundamental connection.

	"Darklords range from monstrous tyrants to depraved individuals who otherwise appear as ordinary people. A Darklord's position and powers stem from their deeds, not their game statistics. While some Darklords are deadly or possess foul gifts from the Dark Powers, many pose little threat in battle. Their menace is the result of capabilities beyond physical prowess.": "黑暗领主的范围从畸形的暴君到堕落的个人，否则就像普通人一样。黑暗领主的地位和权力来自他们的行为，而不是他们的游戏数据。虽然有些黑暗领主是致命的，或者拥有来自黑暗力量的肮脏的礼物，但许多人在战斗中并不构成威胁。他们的威胁来自于超越身体力量的能力。",
	"Darklords might brood over their failures, but nevertheless they relentlessly strive to achieve their ambitions. Their desperate struggles fuel their conflicts with characters. Liberally use Darklords in your adventures rather than saving them for distant climactic plots.": "黑暗统治者可能会对他们的失败耿耿于怀，但尽管如此，他们还是不懈地努力实现他们的野心。他们绝望的挣扎助长了他们与角色的冲突。在你的冒险中自由地使用黑暗君主，而不是把他们留到遥远的高潮情节中。",
	"With a few exceptions, Darklords don't realize they occupy a special place in the world. Their agendas, obsessions, and egotism distract them from focusing on the strangeness of the world and petty concerns such as eerie fog.": "除了少数例外，黑暗君主并没有意识到他们在这个世界上占据了一个特殊的位置。他们的议程、痴迷和自负分散了他们的注意力，使他们无法专注于这个世界的奇怪之处，以及诸如阴森的雾气等琐碎的问题。",
	"Darklords are casually immortal, many having no concept of how long they've lived, how many times they've died, or why they returned to life. Should a Darklord fall, the temporary defeat lasts until they're restored by the Dark Powers. In their absence, those who sought to escape or supplant them seize their chance.": "黑暗领主是随意不死的，许多人对自己活了多久，死了多少次，或者为什么复活都没有概念。如果一个黑暗领主倒下了，暂时的失败会持续到他们被黑暗势力恢复。在他们不在的时候，那些试图逃离或取代他们的人抓住了机会。",
	"The Domains of Dread don't typically breed heroes. For the inhabitants of most domains, simply surviving the night is an act of courage. Those willing to confront the terrors of the Mists are rare, but when they do, they have one of the following origins:": "恐惧之域通常不孕育英雄。对于大多数领域的居民来说，仅仅是在黑夜中生存就是一种勇气的表现。那些愿意与迷雾的恐怖对抗的人很少，但当他们这样做时，他们有以下的起源之一。",

By the same token, the DM can't craft an enjoyably spooky experience if they're not aware of your interests in and thresholds for participating in fear-focused adventures.

What you shrug off other players might find personally unsettling—everyone's experiences and tolerances are distinct and real, even if they differ from your own. Before creating a character, ask your DM and the rest of the group the aforementioned questions, along with any others that come to mind. {@book Chapter 4|VRGR|4|Preparing for Horror} encourages DMs to facilitate pregame discussions to make sure the entire group agrees on content, boundaries, and tools to keep the terror fun.

	"When planning to play a scary adventure, create a character prepared to be scared. Consider how your character reacts to being frightened and how that affects the creepy atmosphere of the adventure. Don't consider fear a tactical disadvantage or something to be avoided. As part of playing a frightening game, you're a participant in building and reinforcing a sense of dread for everyone at the table. If your character laughs in the face of every danger, they undermine the adventure's threats and its broader atmosphere.": "当计划玩一个可怕的冒险时，创造一个准备被吓到的角色。考虑你的角色在受到惊吓时的反应，以及这对冒险的惊悚气氛的影响。不要认为恐惧是一种战术上的劣势或需要回避的东西。作为玩一个可怕的游戏的一部分，你是一个参与者，为桌子上的每个人建立和加强恐惧感。如果你的角色面对每一个危险都笑，他们就会破坏冒险的威胁和更广泛的气氛。",
	"When creating and playing your character, consider courage not as the absence of fear but as the process of overcoming it. How might your character react in surprise before they rally to overcome the terror they face? Do they scream, flee, or freeze? Or might they throw themself into battle, perhaps recklessly or for too long? Record a default reaction on your character sheet so you can respond consistently when shocking events occur.": "在创造和扮演你的角色时，不要把勇气看作是没有恐惧，而要看作是克服恐惧的过程。在你的角色团结起来克服他们所面临的恐怖之前，他们可能会有怎样的惊讶反应？他们会尖叫、逃亡、还是僵住？或者他们可能会不顾一切地投入战斗，或者时间过长？在你的角色表上记录一个默认的反应，这样你就可以在震惊的事件发生时做出一致的反应。",
	"Beyond this, discuss with your group how much fear ties into the game's rules. Would you prefer to keep frightful reactions narrative, or would you like to use game rules that present additional challenges and benefits? Ask your DM about the possibility of using the rules for inspiration to motivate fearful character reactions, as detailed in the \"{@variantrule Fear and Stress|VRGR}\" section of {@book chapter 4|VRGR|4}. Using this system, a character who possesses particular fears and uses them to guide their responses to horrific scenes might earn inspiration for reinforcing the adventure's frightful atmosphere. The DM might not employ these rules every time something frightening occurs, but your group might use them as a way to highlight individual fears and build an adventure's overarching sense of dread.": "除此之外，与你的小组讨论恐惧与游戏规则的关系有多大。你是愿意保持恐惧反应的叙述性，还是愿意使用提出额外挑战和好处的游戏规则？问问你的DM，是否有可能使用规则来激发角色的恐惧反应，正如(%%)的\"{@variantrule Fear and Stress|VRGR} \"部分所详述的。使用这个系统，一个拥有特殊恐惧并利用它们来指导自己对恐怖场景的反应的角色可能会获得灵感，以加强冒险的恐怖气氛。管理员可能不会在每次发生可怕的事情时都使用这些规则，但你的小组可以用它们来突出个人的恐惧，并建立冒险的总体恐惧感。",

	"Knowing what frightens your character provides insight into their past and can motivate their behavior. A character's fear of cats might stem from a terrible sight they witnessed at their grandmother's home, while a fear of earthquakes might hearken back to the experience of being trapped after a tremor. Consider two or three things that unsettle your character, what they tell you about their past, and if those fears shape who they are now.": "知道是什么让你的角色感到害怕，就能了解他们的过去，并能激发他们的行为。一个角色对猫的恐惧可能源于他们在祖母家看到的可怕景象，而对地震的恐惧可能源于地震后被困住的经历。考虑两三件让你的角色不安的事情，他们告诉你他们的过去，以及这些恐惧是否塑造了他们现在的形象。",

	"Body horror as a genre examines a universal fear: our own failing anatomies. We rarely think about what goes on beneath our skin. We understand that the organs operate in harmony: the heart beats, the lungs pump air, and the gastrointestinal system labors to supply us with nutrients. But we don't ponder the minutiae.

	"Gothic horror is about the terror within, not without. It shatters the illusion of humanity in a poignant way by holding a mirror up to us and saying: look at what we truly are, and look at what we pretend to be. Under that mask of civility, there is depravity. Under that thin veneer of society, there is wickedness. Under all the trappings of sophistication, are we not all predators or prey? Gothic horror shatters the lies we trick ourselves into believing and shows that we, not some distant entity, are and ever shall be the architects of our doom. The quest for perfection leads us to discover our own imperfection. Our quest for the divine leads us to believe we, ourselves, are gods. These are the themes that haunt stories of Gothic horror.": "哥特式恐怖是关于内部的恐怖，而不是外部的。它以一种凄美的方式打破了人类的幻觉，对我们举起一面镜子，说：看看我们真正是什么，看看我们假装是什么。在文明的面具下，存在着堕落。在社会的那层薄薄的外衣下，是邪恶的。在所有复杂的外衣下，我们不都是掠夺者或猎物吗？哥特式的恐怖打破了我们欺骗自己相信的谎言，并表明我们，而不是某个遥远的实体，是而且永远是我们厄运的设计者。对完美的追求使我们发现自己的不完美。我们对神性的追求使我们相信我们自己是神。这些都是萦绕在哥特式恐怖故事中的主题。",

	"In disaster horror adventures, the world has fallen to ruin—or it's getting there fast. The unthinkable has happened and, as a result, society is collapsing.

Regardless of a hero's power, the best-timed critical hit or the most powerful spell might not fix a city ruined by an earthquake or a world ravaged by plagues.": "在灾难性的恐怖冒险中，世界已经沦为一片废墟--或者说它正在迅速沦陷。不可思议的事情发生了，结果是，社会正在崩溃。在这些故事中，怪物或恶棍可能会被像流星雨或火山爆发所带来的连环灾难所取代。无论英雄的力量如何，最适时的关键一击或最强大的法术都可能无法修复一个被地震毁坏的城市或被瘟疫蹂躏的世界。",

	"Adventures rooted in the occult detective genre straddle the line between fantasy, mystery, and horror. For the occult detective, solving paranormal mysteries is all part of the job. In these adventures, villains employ supernatural powers toward nefarious ends while characters act as detectives, interpreting events, learning patterns, deducing goals, and ultimately putting an end to the threat. investigation and cleverness take center stage in these adventures, though as in the noir stories that inspire the genre, there's plenty of room for action.": "植根于神秘学侦探流派的冒险活动跨越了幻想、神秘和恐怖之间的界限。对于神秘学侦探来说，解决超自然的谜团是工作的一部分。在这些冒险中，恶棍利用超自然的力量达到邪恶的目的，而人物则扮演侦探的角色，解释事件，学习模式，推断目标，并最终结束威胁。调查和聪明在这些冒险中占据中心位置，尽管在激发这一类型的黑色故事中，有大量的行动空间。",
	"Occult detective adventures can be just as terrifying as any other horror adventures, but also might be lighter in tone. Adventurers might experience terrors only after they've happened and face a foe only once they're prepared to end its threat. Of course, there are ways to create threats distinct to this genre, such as when villains view detectives as rivals or targets.": "神秘的侦探冒险可以像其他恐怖冒险一样令人恐惧，但也可能在语气上更轻松。冒险者可能会在恐怖发生后才经历恐怖，并且只有在他们准备结束威胁时才面对敌人。当然，也有一些方法可以创造出与这一类型不同的威胁，例如当反派将侦探视为对手或目标时。",
	"When creating an occult detective adventure, consider what monster, magic, or other supernatural force might lend a thrilling twist to some criminal enterprise. How will the characters catch an invisible assassin or a thief that pilfers extradimensional spaces? Once you know the villain's mode of operation, consider how it might give itself away. Even if you're not sure, listen to the characters' plans and give them opportunities to feel brilliant in the course of running your adventures.": "在创作神秘的侦探冒险故事时，要考虑什么怪物、魔法或其他超自然力量会给某些犯罪行为带来惊心动魄的变化。角色们将如何抓住一个无形的刺客或一个偷窃次元空间的小偷？一旦你知道了反派的行动方式，就要考虑它可能如何暴露自己。即使你不确定，也要听从人物的计划，在运行冒险的过程中，给他们机会感受到辉煌。",

	"When creating adventures rooted in psychological horror, consider common fears and anxieties. These readily become metaphors for villains and monsters. Fear of being judged by one's peers might manifest as a jury of nothics, while fear of change could be represented by a medusa that petrifies those who threaten her community's status quo.": "在创作植根于心理恐怖的冒险时，要考虑常见的恐惧和焦虑。这些很容易成为恶棍和怪物的隐喻。对被同龄人评判的恐惧可能表现为一个无名小卒的陪审团，而对变化的恐惧则可以由一个使那些威胁到她的社区现状的人石化的美杜莎来代表。",
	"Uncertainty, paranoia, and blurred lines between reality and fiction also shape psychological horror stories. In your adventures, this might take the form of unreliable information. Characters might experience a deadly encounter only to wake up at the end, not having previously realized they were asleep. Before undermining characters' senses, though, make sure you know what's driving these skewed perceptions and how characters might overcome them. The \"{@variantrule Fear and Stress|VRGR}\" section of {@book chapter 4|VRGR|4} provides options for dealing with the stress of adventuring. If some force is actively trying to cause stress for characters, this might lead to its own psychological horror adventure.": "不确定性、偏执狂和现实与虚构之间的模糊界限也塑造了心理恐怖故事。在你的冒险中，这可能采取不可靠的信息的形式。角色可能会经历一次致命的遭遇，但在最后醒来时却没有意识到自己在睡觉。不过，在破坏角色的感官之前，要确保你知道是什么在驱动这些歪曲的感知，以及角色如何克服这些感知。{@book chapter 4|VRGR|4}的\"{@variantrule Fear and Stress|VRGR} \"部分提供了处理冒险压力的选项。如果某种力量正积极地试图给角色造成压力，这可能会导致其自身的心理恐怖冒险。",

When creating your own monster or slasher horror adventures, choose a creature with a challenge rating high enough that your party won't defeat it with a few lucky hits. Also consider foes with details you're eager to explore in various terrifying scenes. A medusa, for example, becomes all the more terrifying when it murders with petrified body parts or forces victims into unsettling poses before petrifying them. Also, consider who the villain's targets are and why the villain has chosen to prey upon that group. Is it out of hunger or for revenge, or does the creature have a more deep seated need to kill?": "这种类型的冒险通常包括一个威胁到一个团体的主要对手。这可能是一个特别大的或狡猾的野兽，一个恐吓邻里的杀人犯，一个跟踪城镇的怪物，或者一个传播一种标志性死亡的超自然威胁。在创造你自己的怪物或屠杀者恐怖冒险时，要选择一个挑战等级足够高的生物，使你的队伍不会因为几次幸运的打击而打败它。还要考虑具有你急于在各种恐怖场景中探索的细节的敌人。例如，当冥王星用石化的身体部位进行谋杀或在石化受害者之前强迫他们摆出令人不安的姿势时，就会变得更加可怕。此外，还要考虑反派的目标是谁，以及反派为什么选择捕食这个群体。是出于饥饿或报复，还是该生物有更深层次的杀戮需求？",
	"The relentless killers presented in {@book chapter 5|VRGR|5|Relentless Killer} provide perfect foes for adventures embracing this type of horror. Also, when creating adventures inspired by monster or slasher horror, ask yourself the following questions:": "{@book chapter 5|VRGR|5|Relentless Killer}中呈现的无情的杀手为拥抱这种恐怖的冒险提供了完美的敌人。另外，在创建由怪物或屠杀者恐怖片启发的冒险时，要问自己以下问题。",

At this eerie edge of the multiverse, the Dark Powers collect the most wicked beings from across ages and worlds within inescapable, mist-shrouded domains.

	"The Dark Powers also grant Darklords limited ability to manipulate the Mists surrounding their domains, allowing most to open or close their domains' borders to others on a whim. If a domain's borders are closed, supernatural agitation is obvious to any who approach the Mists.

Creatures that enter the Mists at this time, including flying creatures, are subject to the following effects:": "黑暗力量还赋予黑暗领主有限的能力来操纵其领地周围的迷雾，允许大多数人随心所欲地对他人开放或关闭其领地的边界。如果一个领域的边界被关闭，超自然的躁动对任何接近迷雾的人来说都是明显的。这表现为雾气中的咆哮干扰、威胁性的人影、威胁性的声音，或其他以黑暗领主或领地为主题的活动。在这个时候进入迷雾的生物，包括飞行生物，都会受到以下影响。",

Few who dwell in the Domains of Dread know how to use Mist talismans or have interest in traveling to other domains.

	"In some domains, magic is an everyday part of life, while in others, insular communities fear it as the province of monsters.

It's up to you to decide how pervasive magic is in a domain, choosing whether a dearth or an excess of magic is more terrifying.": "在某些领域，魔法是生活的一部分，而在另一些领域，孤立无援的社区则担心魔法是怪物的专利。很少有领地完全否认魔法或禁止使用魔法，但除了当地治疗师的咒语或偶尔的传家宝的力量之外，魔法可能是罕见的。由你来决定魔法在一个领域中的普及程度，选择魔法的匮乏还是过剩更令人恐惧。",
	"In domains where inhabitants regard simple magic as remarkable, those inhabitants' lack of engagement with the supernatural doesn't mean you should limit magic for adventurers. Rather, use this as an opportunity to feature magic-using characters as figures of awe or terror, or to assign storied origins to common magic items.": "在那些居民认为简单的魔法是了不起的领域，这些居民缺乏与超自然现象的接触并不意味着你应该限制冒险者的魔法。相反，你可以利用这个机会将使用魔法的角色作为敬畏或恐怖的人物，或者为普通的魔法物品赋予故事性的起源。",
	"The Dark Powers influence magical effects, imparting them with sinister qualities. How these changes manifest are for you to decide and can shift from domain to domain. Do summoned creatures appear undead in one domain or violently mutated in another? Do divination spells rasp in the voices of otherworldly ancients? Do the effects of drinking a {@item potion of healing} feel like grubs weaving wounds shut from within? Magic looks menacing in the Domains of Dread, but descriptive embellishments shouldn't change the actual effects of spells or magic items.": "黑暗力量影响着魔法效果，使它们具有邪恶的品质。这些变化是由你来决定的，并且可以在不同的领域中变化。召唤的生物在一个领域里是不死的，在另一个领域里是暴力变异的？占卜的咒语是否会发出其他世界的古人的声音？饮用{@item potion of healing}的效果是否感觉像蛴螬从内部编织出的伤口？在恐惧之域中，魔法看起来很可怕，但描述性的修饰不应该改变法术或魔法物品的实际效果。",
	"Everyone among the Domains of Dread is a prisoner. The Darklords number among the most prominent captives, but every creature claimed by the Mists dwells outside the natural order of the multiverse. Even death doesn't afford an escape from the Dark Powers, which hoard every soul that falls into their clutches. In the Land of the Mists, death isn't an escape, but the beginning of a new terror.": "恐惧之域中的每个人都是囚犯。黑暗领主是最突出的俘虏之一，但每一个被迷雾领走的生物都生活在多元宇宙的自然秩序之外。即使是死亡也无法从黑暗势力手中逃脱，他们囤积了每一个落入他们魔掌的灵魂。在迷雾之地，死亡并不是一种逃避，而是一种新的恐怖的开始。",
	"Not every being among the Domains of Dread has a soul. Many inhabitants of each domain are creations of the Dark Powers, whose bodies have been formed from the land and the Mists. For all intents and purposes, and even under magical detection, these beings are what they appear to be. The Dark Powers fashion them as living puppets—individuals who live unremarkable lives that reinforce the status quo, culture, and frustration that torment a domain's Darklord.": "在恐惧之域中，并非每个生命都有灵魂。每个领域的许多居民都是黑暗势力的创造物，他们的身体由土地和迷雾形成。就所有的意图和目的而言，甚至在魔法检测下，这些生命都是他们的表象。黑暗势力将他们塑造成活生生的傀儡--他们过着不起眼的生活，强化了现状、文化和折磨一个领域的黑暗势力的挫折感。",
	"Individuals born in the Land of the Mists who have souls tend to be vibrant, imaginative, and ambitious. But they find these virtues stifled by the dour, soulless individuals who outnumber them, leading many to seek better lives and answers to the mysteries of their home domain. Every player's character who was born in a domain is one of these vibrant souls.": "出生在迷雾之地的有灵魂的人往往充满活力、富有想象力和野心。但他们发现这些美德被那些数量多于他们的沉闷、没有灵魂的人扼杀了，导致许多人寻求更好的生活和对他们家乡领域的神秘的答案。每个出生在某个领域的玩家的角色都是这些充满活力的灵魂之一。",
	"When a creature with a soul dies among the Domains of Dread, its spirit becomes caught in the Mists and can't travel to the afterlife. If a creature who has been dead for at least 24 hours returns to life by way of a spell or other supernatural means, it realizes that its spirit is trapped within the Mists, likely forever. Using the rules for \"{@variantrule Fear and Stress|VRGR}\" from {@book chapter 4|VRGR|4}, the creature gains a new Seed of Fear.": "当一个有灵魂的生物在恐惧之域中死亡时，它的灵魂会陷入迷雾之中，无法前往来世。如果一个已经死了至少24小时的生物通过法术或其他超自然的方式恢复了生命，它就会意识到它的灵魂被困于迷雾之中，很可能永远地被困住。使用{@book chapter 4|VRGR|4}中\"{@variantrule Fear and Stress|VRGR} \"的规则，该生物获得一个新的恐惧之种。",
	"If a being with a soul dies and is not returned to life, that soul remains trapped within the Domains of Dread until it is reincarnated, a process that can take decades. Individuals who inherit the same soul over generations often look alike and might recall memories of their past lives.": "如果一个有灵魂的人死后没有复活，这个灵魂就会一直被困在恐惧之域中，直到转世，这个过程可能需要几十年。几代人继承同一个灵魂的人往往看起来很像，并可能回忆起他们过去生活的记忆。",
	"The state of souls in the Domains of Dread provides a dose of existential terror to those hoping to manipulate life and death to escape these realms. Beyond that, who does and doesn't have a soul among the domains rarely matters unless an adventure explores themes of life, death, and reincarnation. Players might create ties with long-dead individuals using the {@book Dark Gifts|VRGR|1} and {@book backgrounds|VRGR|1} presented in {@book chapter 1|VRGR|1}. But overall, spiritual stagnation in the Land of the Mists is meant to provide the opportunity for grim revelations, not existential bookkeeping.": "恐惧之域中的灵魂状态为那些希望操纵生死以逃离这些领域的人提供了一剂生存的恐怖。除此之外，在这些领域中谁有灵魂和谁没有灵魂很少有关系，除非冒险探索了生命、死亡和转世的主题。玩家可能会利用{@book chapter 1|VRGR|1}中提出的{@book Dark Gifts|VRGR|1}和{@book backgrounds|VRGR|1}与死去已久的人建立联系。但总的来说，迷雾之地的精神停滞是为了提供严峻的启示的机会，而不是存在主义的簿记。",
	"Each domain is its own demiplane, isolated from all other planes including the Material Plane. No spell—not even {@spell wish}—allows escape from the Domains of Dread. Spells such as {@spell astral projection}, {@spell plane shift}, {@spell teleport}, and similar magic cast for the purpose of escaping a domain simply fail, as do effects that banish a creature to another plane. These restrictions apply to all other effects, including magic items and artifacts that transport or banish creatures to other planes. Magic that allows transit to the Border Ethereal, such as the {@spell etherealness} spell and the Etherealness feature of ghosts, is the exception to this rule. A creature that enters the Border Ethereal from a domain is pulled back into the domain it left upon leaving the Ethereal.": "每个领域都是自己的半位面，与包括物质界在内的所有其他位面隔离。没有任何法术--甚至是{@spell wish}--可以从恐惧之域中逃脱。诸如(1%)、(2%)、(3%)之类的法术，以及为逃离领域而施放的类似魔法都会失败，将生物放逐到另一个位面的效果也一样。这些限制适用于所有其他效果，包括将生物运送或放逐到其他位面的魔法物品和神器。允许传送到边界虚空的魔法，例如(4%)咒语和鬼魂的虚空特性，是这个规则的例外。从一个领域进入边界虚空的生物在离开虚空后会被拉回它离开的领域。",
	"For the purpose of spells whose effects change across or are blocked by planar boundaries (such as {@spell sending}), each domain is considered its own plane. Magic that summons creatures or objects from other planes functions normally, as does magic that involves an extradimensional space. Spells cast within an extradimensional space (such as that created by {@spell Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion}) are subject to the same restrictions as magic cast within a domain.": "对于那些效果跨越平面边界变化或被平面边界阻挡的法术（比如（%0%）），每个领域都被视为自己的平面。从其他位面召唤生物或物体的魔法功能正常，涉及超维空间的魔法也一样。在次元空间内施展的魔法（例如由（%%）创建的空间）受到与在领域内施展的魔法相同的限制。",
	"While in the Domains of Dread, characters who receive spells from deities or otherworldly patrons continue to do so. In addition, spells that allow contact with beings from other planes function normally, with one proviso: the domain's Darklord senses when someone in their domain casts such a spell and can choose to make themself the spell's target, so that they become the one who is contacted.": "在恐惧之域中，从神灵或其他世界的赞助者那里接受法术的角色继续这样做。此外，允许与其他位面的生命接触的法术也能正常运作，但有一个条件：当他们领域的人施展这样的法术时，领域的黑暗领主会察觉，并可以选择让自己成为法术的目标，这样他们就会成为被联系到的人。",
	"The realities of the Domains of Dread seem strange or impossible to individuals from other worlds, but for those who live among the Mists, they're facts of life. With no basis for comparison, domain inhabitants call those who speak of other worlds liars. For them, the following topics are standard aspects of life in their home domain or in a broader collection of domains they call the Land of the Mists.": "对于来自其他世界的人来说，恐惧之域的现实似乎很奇怪或不可能，但对于生活在迷雾中的人来说，它们是生活的事实。由于没有比较的基础，领域内的居民称那些谈论其他世界的人为骗子。对他们来说，以下话题是他们家乡领域或被称为 \"迷雾之地 \"的更广泛领域中的标准生活内容。",
	"Each domain boasts its own culture, either drawn from the Material Plane or a parody manufactured to torment a Darklord. As such, a domain might exhibit traditions and technologies unheard of in other domains. The specifics of each domain's technological advancements are left to you. If you wish domains to feature cutting-edge weird science or inventions such as {@book firearms|DMG|9|Firearms} (see the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}), feel free to do so. Regardless of a domain's culture and innovations, the Mists prevent knowledge of them from spreading. Even if an innovation is taken from one domain to another, the suspicion of the new domain's inhabitants prevents it from gaining acceptance. Such is the subtle control of the Dark Powers, ensuring their nightmare realms remain just so.": "每个领域都拥有自己的文化，要么来自物质世界，要么是为折磨黑暗领主而制造的模仿品。因此，一个领域可能表现出其他领域闻所未闻的传统和技术。每个领域的技术进步的具体细节由你决定。如果你希望某个领域以尖端的怪异科学或发明为特色，如（%0%）（见（%1%）），请自由发挥。无论一个领域的文化和创新如何，迷雾会阻止它们的知识传播。即使一项创新从一个领域被带到另一个领域，新领域居民的怀疑也会阻止它获得接受。这就是黑暗势力的微妙控制，确保他们的梦魇之域保持原样。",
	"Many domains mint their own gold, silver, and copper coins. Though these currencies bear different markings, merchants aren't particular about the designs stamped on coinage. A gold piece from Barovia spends as well in Borca as it does in Har'Akir, as long as it weighs true. Platinum and electrum coins rarely circulate through the domains, but they appear often enough—originating from hidden troves or ancient vaults—that no trader questions their value.": "许多领域都铸造了自己的金币、银币和铜币。虽然这些货币有不同的标记，但商人们对印在钱币上的设计并不挑剔。一块来自巴罗维亚的金币在博尔卡和在哈克尔的消费一样好，只要它的重量是真实的。铂金和银币很少在各地区流通，但它们经常出现--或来自隐藏的宝库或古老的金库--所以没有商人质疑它们的价值。",
	"By impossible coincidence, all domains share a language despite their profoundly different origins: Common, which functions as a shared tongue throughout the Land of the Mists. Beyond this, all the other languages noted in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} and {@book Monster Manual|MM} are spoken among the Domains of Dread, some more pervasively than others. The same language spoken in multiple domains might bear subtle differences or unique words. Speakers from different domains might also have distinct accents, but their words are understandable.": "由于不可能的巧合，所有的领域都有一种语言，尽管它们的起源截然不同。通用语，它作为整个迷雾之地的共同语言发挥作用。除此之外，{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}和{@book Monster Manual|MM}中提到的所有其他语言都在恐惧之域中使用，有些比其他语言更普遍。在多个领域使用的同一种语言可能会有细微的差异或独特的词汇。来自不同领域的说话者也可能有明显的口音，但他们的话是可以理解的。",
	"If you want to highlight the differences between domains, you can do away with Common and decide that the inhabitants of each domain speak their own unique language, which either take the name of their domain or a culturally specific name. For example, the language of Barovia could be Barovian or Balok. The languages of specific races, such as Elvish or Dwarvish, remain the same in every domain. Those who wish to learn a domain's language can do so using the training downtime activity (see the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}). Although it takes 250 days to gain mastery of a language, consider allowing characters to navigate basic social interactions—such as asking for directions or conveying peaceful intentions—after 7 days of training.": "如果你想突出各域之间的差异，你可以不使用通用语，而决定每个域的居民说他们自己独特的语言，这些语言要么采用他们域的名称，要么采用文化上的特定名称。例如，巴罗维亚的语言可以是巴罗维亚语或巴洛克语。特定种族的语言，如精灵语或矮人语，在每个领域都保持不变。那些希望学习某个领域的语言的人可以通过训练停工活动来实现（见（%0%））。尽管掌握一种语言需要250天的时间，但可以考虑在训练7天后允许角色驾驭基本的社会互动--比如问路或传达和平意图。",
	"In many domains, locals maintain chilly relationships with aloof deities, knowing \"the gods\" only through hollow rituals and clergy with scant supernatural powers. Conversely, some people privately worship ancestral gods—deities of their family's tradition with whom they form deep, personal connections. Divergent faiths abound, and some that begin as charlatanry inexplicably gain the power of true faith. Ultimately, any deity from the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} or any other setting might find followers among the Domains of Dread. By the same token, the Dark Powers breathe life into the beliefs of cruel practices and the faiths of false zealots.": "在许多地区，当地人与冷漠的神灵保持着冷淡的关系，只通过空洞的仪式和没有超自然能力的神职人员了解 \"神\"。相反，有些人私下里崇拜祖先的神灵--他们家族传统中的神灵，与他们形成深刻的个人联系。不同的信仰比比皆是，有些开始时是骗人的，后来却莫名其妙地获得了真正信仰的力量。最终，任何来自{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}或任何其他背景的神灵都可能在恐惧之域中找到追随者。同样地，黑暗势力也为残忍的做法和虚假的狂热者的信仰注入了活力。",
	"One noteworthy exception to this is the worship of the god Ezra, which has its origins in the Mists (see the \"Ezra, God of the Mists\" sidebar). For your adventures, you define what deities are worshiped in a domain and whether those deities are actual gods, manifestations of the Dark Powers, or one masquerading as the other.": "一个值得注意的例外是对以斯拉神的崇拜，它起源于迷雾（见 \"以斯拉，迷雾之神 \"侧边栏）。在你的冒险中，你要定义一个领域中所崇拜的神灵，以及这些神灵是真正的神灵，还是黑暗势力的表现，或者是伪装成其他神灵。",
	"The denizens of several domains worship an aloof god known as Ezra. Depicted as a vague, vaporous figure, the god is known for her dark, billowing hair and for her ability to manipulate the Mists. Her holy symbol is a sprig of belladonna atop a silver kite shield. Beyond that, her disparate sects of worshipers view her differently—and contradictorily. For some, Ezra is a goodly guardian, while others perceive her as a soul-stealing embodiment of the Mists. Ultimately, though, her true nature is a mystery. Whether she's a manifestation of the Dark Powers, an aspect of the Plane of Shadow's mysterious Raven Queen, or something else entirely is for you to decide. Whatever the case, Ezra's followers, traditions, alignment, and the domains she grants her clerics vary widely. Collaborate with players who want to create characters devoted to Ezra to define the god's role in their domain of origin.": "几个领域的居民都崇拜一个冷漠的神，称为 \"埃兹拉\"。该神被描绘成一个模糊的、虚无缥缈的形象，以她那乌黑、飘逸的头发和操纵迷雾的能力而闻名。她的神圣标志是银色风筝盾牌上的一枝颠茄。除此之外，她的不同教派的崇拜者对她的看法各不相同，而且相互矛盾。对一些人来说，以斯拉是一个善良的守护者，而其他人则认为她是一个偷窃灵魂的迷雾化身。但最终，她的真实性质是一个谜。她是黑暗力量的表现，还是阴影世界神秘的乌鸦女王的一个方面，或者完全是其他什么东西，由你来决定。无论怎样，以斯拉的追随者、传统、结盟以及她授予她的牧师的领域都有很大不同。与那些想要创建献身于艾兹拉的角色的玩家合作，以确定该神在其起源领域的作用。",
	"The Domains of Dread don't share a unified calendar. However, in most domains, locals measure time by \"moons\" rather than months. As a measurement of time, each moon begins on the first night of a full moon and lasts a full lunar cycle. A year consists of twelve moons, or twelve lunar cycles. While domains don't ascribe to a shared history, the populace of all domains inexplicably accept the current year as 735. Some local histories cleave to anomalous dates and methods of tracking years, but these are considered obsolete. No such irregularities exist in Barovia, though, where year 1 corresponds with the founding of Barovia by the von Zarovich family.": "恐惧之域不共享统一的日历。然而，在大多数地区，当地人用 \"月亮 \"而不是月来衡量时间。作为对时间的衡量，每个月亮从满月的第一个晚上开始，持续一个完整的月球周期。一年由12个月亮组成，或12个月球周期。虽然各领域没有共同的历史，但所有领域的民众都莫名其妙地接受目前的年份为735。有些地方的历史会采用反常的日期和追踪年份的方法，但这些被认为是过时的。但在巴罗维亚不存在这种不正常的情况，第一年与冯-扎罗维奇家族建立巴罗维亚的时间相一致。",
	"In some domains, the residents are aware that realms exist beyond the Mists, but most have little interest in lands beyond their own. The Darklords' obsessions distract them from concerns about the nature of their domains or what lies beyond the Mists. This preoccupation, along with the lack of shared borders or reliable travel, means that mercantile ventures and military conquests between domains are essentially impossible.": "在一些领域，居民们意识到迷雾之外的领域存在，但大多数人对自己领域之外的土地没有兴趣。黑暗领主们的痴迷让他们无暇顾及自己领地的性质或迷雾之外的东西。这种专注，加上缺乏共同的边界或可靠的旅行，意味着域与域之间的商业冒险和军事征服基本上是不可能的。",
	"Rare individuals do travel between the domains, such as adventurers or roving Vistani families (detailed at the end of this {@book chapter|VRGR|3|Vistani}).

These ravens deliver envelopes and tiny parcels between private rookeries maintained by the Keepers. Individuals and businesses friendly with the Keepers—such as a village notary or inn—might surreptitiously contract their services, allowing customers to send a letter for 1 gp. These letters must include a destination where another Keeper can receive them, then either hold or deliver the correspondence—with delivery costs an additional 1 gp. Letters take at least one day to deliver. The Keepers of the Feather make no assurances about the safe delivery of letters in their charge, but their services prove relatively reliable. Rumors speak of more expensive services the Keepers provide to select clients, such as delivery to individuals whose whereabouts are unknown or verbal messages relayed by talking ravens.": "由于在迷雾中旅行的危险和不可靠，那些对家乡领域之外感兴趣的少数人将写信作为他们的首选沟通方式。一个名为{@book Keepers of the Feather|VRGR|3|Keepers of the Feather}的团体（详见本章后面的\"{@book Travelers in the Mists|VRGR|3} \"部分）监管着一个由信鸽组成的私人网络，它拥有在迷雾中航行的不可思议的能力。这些乌鸦在守护者们维护的私人鸟巢之间运送信封和小包裹。与守护者友好的个人和企业--比如村里的公证人或旅馆--可能会偷偷地承包它们的服务，允许顾客以1戈比寄信。这些信件必须包括一个其他守护者可以接收它们的目的地，然后持有或递送信件--递送费用为额外的1戈比。信件至少需要一天时间才能送达。羽毛守护者对他们负责的信件的安全递送没有保证，但他们的服务被证明是相对可靠的。有传言说，守卫者为特定的客户提供更昂贵的服务，例如为下落不明的人送信或由会说话的乌鸦转达口头信息。",

A Darklord is often far from the most physically daunting creature in their domain, but their nature as a Darklord makes permanently defeating them challenging. To defeat a Darklord, the characters should focus on undermining the Darklord's plots and striking at the core of the Darklord's torments to make them vulnerable (topics explored in \"{@book The Domain's Downfall|VRGR|2|The Domain's Downfall}\" in {@book chapter 2|VRGR|2}).

Their homes occupy opposite ends of the domain, and their interests rarely overlap—that is, until suitably intriguing characters arrive.": "伊万娜-鲍里西和伊万-迪利斯尼亚是鲍尔卡的共同统治者。由于他们同时在同一片土地上犯下了堕落的罪行，黑暗势力将他们两人都集中到了恐惧之域。不过，一般来说，伊万娜和伊万彼此之间没有什么关系。他们的家占据了领域的两端，他们的兴趣也很少重叠--也就是说，直到有适当的有趣的人物到来。",
	"Ivana and Ivan are opposite sides of the same tarnished coin. Ivana fought for all she has and now loathes it; Ivan was given everything and believes he was denied what he deserves. Ivana is forced into society; Ivan thirsts for attention. Ivana appears perpetually youthful; Ivan bears the weight of ages.": "伊万娜和伊万是同一枚被玷污的硬币的两面。伊万娜为她所拥有的一切而奋斗，现在却厌恶它；伊万得到了一切，却认为他被剥夺了他应得的东西。伊万娜被迫进入社会；伊万则渴求关注。伊万娜看起来永远年轻；伊万则承受着岁月的重量。",
	"Although your adventures might focus on either Darklord, Borca presents the opportunity to explore multiple facets of arrogance, selfishness, and obsession. The characters might become the objects of both Darklords' interests. This could put them at the center of a rivalry between the two or provide them with the unique opportunity to leverage one Darklord's power against another. An adventure in Borca doesn't have to involve a conflict between its two Darklords, but if it does, consider putting the party at the center of it.": "虽然你的冒险可能集中在任何一个黑暗领主身上，但博尔卡提供了探索傲慢、自私和痴迷等多个方面的机会。人物可能会成为两个黑暗领主的兴趣对象。这可能使他们处于两个人之间竞争的中心，或者为他们提供独特的机会，利用一个黑暗领主的力量来对付另一个。在博尔卡的冒险不一定要涉及两个黑暗领主之间的冲突，但如果有的话，可以考虑让当事人处于冲突的中心。",
	"The firstborn of the fantastically wealthy Boritsi aristocrats, Ivana was clever, poised, and—in her father Klaus's eyes—utterly unfit to lead their family. Unwilling to accept her father's view, Ivana spent her youth eschewing the dalliances of her kin, instead learning every aspect of her family's business in perfumes and medicinal herbs. Her mother, Camille, encouraged her daughter and tried to ensure that Ivana would one day lead the family.": "伊万娜是富可敌国的Boritsi贵族的长子，她聪明、有风度，在她父亲克劳斯眼中，完全不适合领导他们的家庭。由于不愿意接受她父亲的观点，伊万娜在年轻时就避开了她的亲属的暧昧关系，而是学习她家族的香水和药草业务的各个方面。她的母亲卡米尔鼓励她的女儿，并试图确保伊万娜有一天会领导这个家庭。",
	"Ivana's focus on her goals faltered when she met Pieter, a skilled chemist in the family's service. From him, Ivana learned alchemy and the perfumer's art, and the two grew close. Camille recognized Ivana's budding romance and saw the lowborn Pieter as a threat to Ivana's prospects. Camille thus seduced the young man and arranged for Ivana to discover them, intent on convincing her daughter to forsake this and all future romances.": "当她遇到为家族服务的熟练化学家彼得（Pieter）时，她对自己目标的关注有所动摇。从他那里，伊凡娜学会了炼金术和调香师的艺术，两人的关系也越来越好。卡米尔认识到伊凡娜正在萌芽的爱情，并将出身低微的皮特视为对伊凡娜前景的威胁。因此，卡米尔勾引了这个年轻人，并安排伊凡娜发现他们，打算说服她的女儿放弃这个和所有未来的浪漫。",
	"Ivana took a different lesson from the experience. Realizing the depths of her family's corruption, she poisoned her mother and her callous brothers, with the goal of forcing Klaus to name her his heir. Creating and employing a series of aromatic toxins, she watched her siblings and treacherous mother sicken and die. None suspected her involvement.": "伊凡娜从这次经历中得到了不同的教训。意识到她的家庭腐败的深度，她毒死了她的母亲和她冷酷无情的兄弟，目的是迫使克劳斯指定她为继承人。她创造并使用了一系列芳香的毒素，看着她的兄弟姐妹和奸诈的母亲生病和死亡。没有人怀疑她的参与。",
	"On Ivana's eighteenth birthday, the aged and ailing Klaus summoned her to his office to share a momentous decision. Having lost his sons, Klaus named Ivana's cousin, Ivan Dilisnya, his heir. He had already announced his decision to the estate staff and sent a messenger to inform the Dilisnyas.": "在伊万娜的18岁生日那天，年老体衰的克劳斯把她叫到办公室，分享一个重要的决定。由于失去了儿子，克劳斯指定伊万娜的表弟伊万-迪利斯尼亚为他的继承人。他已经向庄园的工作人员宣布了他的决定，并派出一名信使通知迪利斯尼亚家族。",
	"Ivana only laughed as a toxic mist poured across the Boritsi estate. Having expected her father's pettiness, she had manufactured a disaster that turned all the estate's perfume into poison. Drinking the antidote, Ivana watched as Klaus and all the manor's workers and inhabitants died choking amid a violet fog. By the time the poison cleared, the land of Borca had become surrounded by the Mists.": "伊万娜只是笑了笑，因为一团有毒的雾气涌遍了鲍里西庄园。由于预料到她父亲的小气，她制造了一场灾难，把庄园里所有的香水都变成了毒药。喝下解毒剂后，伊凡娜看着克劳斯和庄园里所有的工人和居民在紫色的雾气中窒息死亡。当毒药清除的时候，博尔卡的土地已经被迷雾包围。",
	"Ivana appears to be a young human woman with statistics similar to a {@creature spy}. Since her arrival in the Land of the Mists, her blood has been tainted with poison, and angry red-and-black veins visibly show through her pale skin. While this discoloration is unignorable, the toxins grant her immunity to poison damage and being {@condition poisoned}. Her genius and ambition define her manipulations.": "伊凡娜看起来是个年轻的人类女性，统计学上类似于（%0%）。自从她来到迷雾之地，她的血液就被毒药污染了，愤怒的红黑色血管明显地从她苍白的皮肤上显现出来。虽然这种变色是不明显的，但这些毒素赋予她对毒物伤害的免疫力，并且是1%。她的天才和野心决定了她的操纵方式。",
	"By spending one uninterrupted hour within her laboratory at the Boritsi Estate, Ivana can create ten doses of any poison or re-create the effect of one wizard spell of 7th level or lower. She keeps a variety of poisons on hand at all times. See \"{@book Intrigue in Borca|VRGR|3|Intrigue in Borca}\" later in this section for details on how Ivana uses alchemy in her manipulations.": "只要在她位于Boritsi庄园的实验室里不间断地待上一个小时，Ivana就可以制造出10个剂量的任何毒药，或者重新创造出一个7级或更低级的巫师法术的效果。她随时都有各种毒药在手。参见本节后面的\"{@book Intrigue in Borca|VRGR|3|Intrigue in Borca}\"，以了解伊凡娜如何使用炼金术进行操纵的细节。",
	"Ivana's genius and cynicism, in combination with the Dark Powers' aid, grant her insight into the nature of Borca's people that borders on precognition. She's always one step ahead of her rivals and has prepared the perfect situation, stand-in, or poison accordingly. However, Ivana has a facile understanding of true love and companionship, so those who behave in an unexpectedly selfless manner might undermine her elaborate contingencies.": "伊凡娜的天才和愤世嫉俗，再加上黑暗势力的帮助，使她对博尔卡人的本质有了近乎预知的洞察力。她总是比她的对手领先一步，并相应地准备了完美的情况、替身或毒药。然而，伊凡娜对真爱和伴侣关系的理解很肤浅，所以那些表现得出乎意料的无私的人可能会破坏她精心设计的应急措施。",
	"Ivana delights in her gardens, both the exotic conservatories within the Boritsi Estate and the flower fields surrounding her manor. She has created innumerable unique plants, as well as plant creatures with strange abilities and unflagging loyalty to her.": "伊凡娜以她的花园为乐，包括波里茨庄园内的异国情调的温室和她庄园周围的花田。她创造了无数独特的植物，以及具有奇怪能力的植物生物，并对她忠心不二。",
	"Ivana's ambition drives her to take on any challenge. She reflexively seeks political and financial control over all Borca, and casually manipulates the domain's noble families into destroying one another.": "伊凡娜的野心促使她接受任何挑战。她反射性地寻求对整个博尔卡的政治和财政控制，并随意操纵该领地的贵族家庭互相毁灭。",
	"Ivana can close or open Borca's borders once per day. She rarely closes the borders, as her manipulations typically prevent her victims from leaving. She might open or close the borders to confound the whims of her co-Darklord, Ivan, though. When she does close Borca's borders, the Mists rise as a wall of acrid chemicals that affect creatures as detailed in \"{@book The Mists|VRGR|3|The Mists}\" section at the start of this chapter.": "伊凡娜每天可以关闭或打开博尔卡的边界一次。她很少关闭边界，因为她的操纵通常会阻止她的受害者离开。不过，她可能会打开或关闭边界，以迷惑她的共同暗黑领主伊凡的奇思妙想。当她关闭博尔卡的边界时，迷雾就会像一堵刺鼻的化学物质墙一样升起，对生物的影响详见本章开头的\"（%0%）\"部分。",
	"Ivana conquered her rivals, yet still suffers. The following circumstances endlessly torment the Darklord:": "伊凡娜征服了她的对手，但仍在遭受痛苦。以下情况无休止地折磨着黑暗君主。",
	"Ivana has not aged since the Mists claimed Borca, and her youthful appearance leads many to underestimate her.": "伊凡娜自迷雾中宣称的博尔卡以来一直没有变老，她年轻的外表导致许多人低估了她。",
	"Ivana rules her family's business and political empire brilliantly. Despite this, she is endlessly doubted and second guessed. Many believe she is a typical, vacant noble youth or the puppet of her elder cousin, Ivan Dilisnya.": "伊万娜出色地统治着她家族的商业和政治帝国。尽管如此，她还是受到无尽的怀疑和猜测。许多人认为她是一个典型的、空虚的贵族青年，或者是她的大表哥伊万-迪利斯尼亚的傀儡。",
	"Ivana's genius and refinement lead her to grow swiftly bored of most potential allies and rivals. She ever seeks her equal in intellect and ambition, and she is ever disappointed. Maintaining her family's vast array of social expectations is especially tedious.": "伊凡娜的天才和精致使她对大多数潜在的盟友和对手迅速感到厌烦。她一直在寻求在智力和野心方面与她相当的人，但她总是感到失望。维持她的家庭的大量社会期望是特别乏味的。",
	"Ivana never found her father's will and knows that should it fall into the wrong hands, her depraved cousin Ivan could claim all she's earned. She'll do anything to prevent this.": "伊凡娜从未找到她父亲的遗嘱，她知道如果遗嘱落入坏人之手，她堕落的表弟伊凡可能会索取她所赚取的一切。她将不惜一切代价来阻止这一切。",
	"Ivana Boritsi's exceptional mind and remarkable senses of hearing, taste, and smell inform her elevated fancies and expansive knowledge of art, food, fashion, social protocols, alchemy, and perfume. Few people can hold her attention, and none can redeem themselves in her eyes from even a moment's boorishness.": "Ivana Boritsi的非凡头脑和非凡的听觉、味觉和嗅觉，使她对艺术、食物、时尚、社会礼仪、炼金术和香水有了更高的幻想和广博的知识。很少有人能吸引她的注意力，在她眼里，没有人能够从哪怕是片刻的粗野中赎回自己。",
	"\"I'm perfect, and no one else understands the strain and expectation that comes with being the best at everything.\"": "\"我是完美的，没有人理解在每件事上都是最好的人所带来的压力和期望。\"",

	"\"It's insulting to think I haven't anticipated every possible outcome.\"": "\"认为我没有预料到每一个可能的结果是一种侮辱。\"",
	"The Dilisnya family maintains a tradition of treachery. The land of Borca originates from the same world as Barovia's conquerors, the von Zaroviches, and Dilisnyas were present at Castle Ravenloft the night of Strahd von Zarovich's transformation.": "Dilisnya家族保持着背叛的传统。波尔卡大陆与巴罗维亚的征服者冯-扎罗维奇家族源自同一个世界，在斯特拉赫-冯-扎罗维奇变身的那晚，迪利斯尼亚家族就出现在雷文洛夫特城堡。",
	"Ages later, the siblings Boris and Camille Dilisnya each plotted to steal the prestige of their cousins, the Boritsis. Camille manipulated her way into the Boritsi family while Boris prepared his son Ivan to be the new head of a united Boritsi–Dilisnya line. Despite abundant opportunities to excel, Ivan grew to embody childish vice and impulsiveness, with his family's wealth and doting servants exacerbating these whims. Frequent \"accidents\" transpired around Ivan, forcing his family to cover up the maimings and deaths of numerous pets and servants. Only Ivan's sister, Kristina, was exempt from his bullying and wicked tricks.": "几百年后，鲍里斯和卡米尔-迪利斯尼亚兄妹各自谋划着窃取他们的表兄弟鲍里西家族的声望。卡米尔操纵她的方式进入鲍里奇家族，而鲍里奇则准备让他的儿子伊万成为统一的鲍里奇-迪利斯尼亚家族的新首脑。尽管有很多机会出人头地，但伊万却逐渐体现出幼稚的恶习和冲动，而他家的财富和宠爱的仆人又加剧了这些奇思妙想。伊万身边经常发生 \"事故\"，迫使他的家人掩盖了许多宠物和仆人的伤残和死亡。只有伊万的妹妹克里斯蒂娜可以免受他的欺凌和恶作剧的影响。",
	"Over time, Kristina proved precocious and eager to learn. Ivan, however, became stubbornly obsessed with childish toys and behaviors. He encouraged his sister to indulge his idealized visions of their childhood, going so far as to affect childlike behaviors and ways of speaking. Although his family members grew increasingly unsettled, they sheltered the future head of their house, reshaping their estate and investing in whimsical diversions for him.": "随着时间的推移，克里斯蒂娜证明了她的早熟和对学习的渴望。然而，伊万却顽固地迷恋上了幼稚的玩具和行为。他鼓励妹妹沉迷于他对他们童年的理想化想象，甚至影响到孩子的行为和说话方式。尽管他的家人越来越不放心，但他们还是庇护了这个未来的一家之主，为他重塑了他们的财产，并投资于异想天开的娱乐活动。",
	"On the night Ivana Boritsi poisoned her family, Ivan learned of his parents' intention to send Kristina to a prestigious boarding school. Screams, cruel cackling, and clockwork screeching filled the Dilisnya estate that night. When it ended, Ivan was the last living member of the Dilisnya family, and the Mists closed in around Borca.": "在伊万娜-鲍里西毒死家人的那个晚上，伊万得知他的父母打算把克里斯蒂娜送到一所著名的寄宿学校。那天晚上，尖叫声、残忍的咯咯声和钟表的刺耳声充满了迪利斯尼亚庄园。当它结束时，伊万是迪利斯尼亚家族最后一个活着的成员，而迷雾则在博尔卡周围合拢。",
	"Ivan isn't a physically or magically powerful Darklord. He's an extremely old man, but supernaturally he remains as physically fit as he was in the prime of life and has the statistics of a human {@creature noble}. His menace manifests in the form of psychological manipulation, making others doubt reality, and causing victims to overestimate his control.": "伊万并不是一个身体或魔法强大的黑暗魔王。他是一个非常老的人，但在超自然的情况下，他的身体仍然和他的壮年时期一样健康，并且拥有人类的统计数据（%0%）。他的威胁表现为心理操纵，使他人怀疑现实，并使受害者高估了他的控制力。",
	"Ivan loathes leaving his estate, but the Dark Powers have granted him the ability to have his letters delivered anywhere he pleases.

	"One of Ivan's favorite manipulations is using his letters and his high-pitched voice to pretend to be a lonely youngster. Ivan keeps out of sight from those he targets for deception so they don't realize the discordance between his childlike affectations and his appearance. If forced to reveal his aged form, he pretends to be confused and employs elaborate clockwork toys, disguises, and conveyances that further mask his true ability.": "伊万最喜欢的手法之一是利用他的信件和他高亢的声音来假装成一个孤独的年轻人。伊万一直躲在他的欺骗对象的视线之外，这样他们就不会意识到他的孩子气和他的外表之间的不协调。如果被迫暴露出他年老的形态，他就会假装糊涂，并采用精心制作的发条玩具、伪装和运输工具，进一步掩盖他的真实能力。",
	"The Dark Powers provide Ivan with any toy he desires. Creatures of many sorts serve Ivan, and any of them, from maids to monstrous guardians, could be clockwork devices or stuffed toys. This doesn't change the creatures' statistics and is revealed only in dramatic moments. Individuals the characters have known for years might eventually be revealed as Ivan's toys.": "黑暗势力为伊万提供他想要的任何玩具。许多种类的生物为伊万服务，其中任何一个，从女仆到畸形的守护者，都可能是发条装置或填充玩具。这并不改变这些生物的统计数据，只有在戏剧性的时刻才会显示出来。角色们认识多年的人最终可能会被发现是伊万的玩具。",
	"The Dilisnya estate, Degravo, is a confusing tangle of topiary gardens, hedge mazes, and neglected petting zoos that abut sheer cliffs. The mansion lies at the heart of the estate, and is divided into multiple structures, including the Laughing House, a playhouse where life-sized toys enact brutal operas, and Ivan's Playroom, a wing dedicated to the master of the estate's clockwork tinkering and private decadences. Ivan tempts victims to his home, where they gradually realize they're trapped in a fun house of childish grotesqueries. Those unable to escape are eventually forced to don the ludicrous livery of the Dilisnya household staff and become Ivan's new servants.": "迪利斯尼亚庄园，即德格拉沃，是一个混乱的纠结，它由拓荒花园、树篱迷宫和被忽视的宠物园组成，紧邻峭壁。大宅位于庄园的中心，被分为多个结构，包括笑屋，这是一个游戏室，里面有真人大小的玩具上演残酷的歌剧，以及伊万的游戏室，这是一个专门用于庄园的钟表修补和私人颓废的主人的侧翼。伊万引诱受害者到他家，在那里他们逐渐意识到他们被困在了一个充满童趣的怪诞屋里。那些无法逃脱的人最终被迫穿上Dilisnya家庭工作人员的可笑服装，成为伊万的新仆人。",
	"Ivan can close or open Borca's borders once per day. He closes them to prevent those he's obsessing over from escaping. When he closes Borca's borders, the Mists rise as detailed in \"{@book The Mists|VRGR|3|The Mists}\" section at the start of this chapter. Additionally, the fog is filled with Ivan's taunting voice and patrolled by grim clockwork toys.": "伊万每天可以关闭或打开博尔卡的边界一次。他关闭边界是为了防止他所迷恋的人逃跑。当他关闭博尔卡的边界时，迷雾就会上升，详见本章开头的\"{@book The Mists|VRGR|3|The Mists} \"部分。此外，雾中充满了伊万嘲弄的声音，并有狰狞的发条玩具在巡逻。",

	"Ivan is alone, and the solitude terrifies him. He was given everything, destroyed it all, and doesn't know how to live. He endlessly creates fawning, fake family from clockwork creations to distract him from his solitude.": "伊万是孤独的，这种孤独使他感到恐惧。他被赋予了一切，摧毁了一切，不知道如何生活。他无休止地从钟表作品中创造出媚俗的假家庭，以分散他对孤独的注意力。",
	"Ivan resents Ivana Boritsi, his closest relative, for having the power he was groomed for, but he also views her as his only peer and as a potential replacement for his sister. Ivana, however, avoids him at all costs.": "伊万对他最亲近的亲戚伊万娜-鲍里奇拥有他被培养出来的权力感到不满，但他也把她看作是他唯一的同龄人，是他妹妹的潜在替代者。然而，伊万娜却不惜一切代价避开他。",

	"Ivan demands to be the center of attention while remaining deeply suspicious of the world beyond Degravo. With his family gone, he coaxes guests to his home to indulge in a perverse mixture of fabulous decadence and his off-putting, childish whims. Ivan delights in his guests' discomfort and in forcing them to entertain him.": "伊万要求成为关注的焦点，同时对德格拉沃以外的世界保持着深深的怀疑。他的家人都不在了，他哄骗客人到他家，让他们沉浸在美妙的颓废和他令人讨厌的、幼稚的奇思妙想的不正常混合体中。伊万以客人的不适为乐，强迫他们为他服务。",
