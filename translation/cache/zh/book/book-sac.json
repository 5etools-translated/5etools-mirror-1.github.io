	"The public statements of the D&D team, or anyone else at {@link Wizards of the Coast|https://dnd.wizards.com}, are not official rulings; they are advice. Jeremy Crawford's tweets are often a preview of rulings that will appear here.": "D&D团队或{@link Wizards of the Coast|https://dnd.wizards.com}的任何其他人的公开声明不是官方裁决；而是建议。杰里米-克劳福德（Jeremy Crawford）的推文通常是对将出现在这里的裁决的预览。",
	"A Dungeon Master adjudicates the game and determines whether to use an official ruling in play. The DM always has the final say on rules questions.": "地牢管理员对游戏进行裁决，并决定是否在游戏中使用官方的裁决。在规则问题上，管理员总是有最终决定权。",
	"Sage Advice answers that are relevant to the current state of the rules are compiled here.": "这里汇编了与规则的现状相关的Sage Advice答案。",
	"Rules are a big part of what makes D&D a game, rather than simply improvised storytelling.": "规则是使D&D成为游戏的重要部分，而不是简单的即兴故事。",
	"The game's rules are meant to help organize, and even inspire, the action of a D&D campaign. The rules are a tool, and we want our tools to be as effective as possible. No matter how good those tools might be, they need a group of players to bring them to life and a DM to guide their use.": "游戏规则的目的是帮助组织，甚至是激发D&D活动的行动。规则是一种工具，而我们希望我们的工具尽可能地有效。无论这些工具有多好，它们都需要一群玩家将其带入生活，并需要一个DM来指导其使用。",
	"The DM is key. Many unexpected things can happen in a D&D campaign, and no set of rules could reasonably account for every contingency. If the rules tried to do so, the game would become unplayable. An alternative would be for the rules to severely limit what characters can do, which would be counter to the open-endedness of D&D. The direction we chose for the current edition was to lay a foundation of rules that a DM could build on, and we embraced the DM's role as the bridge between the things the rules address and the things they don't.": "管理者是关键。在D&D活动中可能会发生许多意想不到的事情，没有一套规则能够合理地考虑到每一个意外情况。如果规则试图这样做，游戏就会变得不可玩。另一个选择是，规则要严格限制角色能做的事情，这与D&D的开放性是相悖的。我们为当前版本选择的方向是为规则打下基础，让管理员可以在此基础上发展，并且我们接受了管理员作为规则所涉及的事情和没有涉及的事情之间的桥梁作用。",
	"In a typical D&D session, a DM makes numerous rules decisions—some barely noticeable and others quite obvious. Players also interpret the rules, and the whole group keeps the game running. There are times, though, when the design intent of a rule isn't clear or when one rule seems to contradict another.": "在一个典型的D&D会议中，DM会做出许多规则决定--有些几乎看不出来，有些则相当明显。玩家也会对规则进行解释，而整个小组也会保持游戏的运行。不过，有时候，规则的设计意图并不明确，或者一条规则似乎与另一条规则相矛盾。",
	"Dealing with those situations is where {@i Sage Advice} comes in. This column doesn't replace a DM's adjudication. Just as the rules do, the column is meant to give DMs, as well as players, tools for tuning the game according to their tastes. The column should also reveal some perspectives that help you see parts of the game in a new light and that aid you in fine-tuning your D&D experience.": "处理这些情况就是（%0%）的作用。本专栏并不取代管理员的裁决。正如规则所做的那样，本专栏旨在为管理员以及玩家提供工具，根据他们的口味来调整游戏。本专栏还应该揭示一些观点，帮助你从新的角度看待游戏的某些部分，并帮助你微调你的D&D经验。",
	"When I answer rules questions, I often come at them from one to three different perspectives.": "当我回答规则问题时，我经常从一到三个不同的角度来看待它们。",
	"\"Rules as written\"—that's what RAW stands for. When I dwell on the RAW interpretation of a rule, I'm studying what the text says in context, without regard to the designers' intent. The text is forced to stand on its own.": "\"书面规则\"--这就是RAW的含义。当我纠结于规则的RAW解释时，我正在研究文本在上下文中的含义，而不考虑设计者的意图。文本被迫站在它自己的立场上。",
	"Whenever I consider a rule, I start with this perspective; it's important for me to see what you see, not what I wished we'd published or thought we'd published.": "每当我考虑一项规则时，我都从这个角度出发；对我来说，重要的是看到你所看到的东西，而不是我希望我们发表的或认为我们发表的东西。",
	"Some of you are especially interested in knowing the intent behind a rule. That's where RAI comes in: \"rules as intended.\" This approach is all about what the designers meant when they wrote something. In a perfect world, RAW and RAI align perfectly, but sometimes the words on the page don't succeed at communicating the designers' intent. Or perhaps the words succeed with one group of players but not with another.": "你们中的一些人对了解一项规则背后的意图特别感兴趣。这就是RAI的作用。\"规则的意图\"。这种方法是关于设计者写东西时的意思。在一个完美的世界里，RAW和RAI完全一致，但有时页面上的文字并不能成功传达设计者的意图。或者说，这些文字在一群玩家中成功了，但在另一群玩家中却没有。",
	"When I write about the RAI interpretation of a rule, I'll be pulling back the curtain and letting you know what the D&D team meant when we wrote a certain rule.": "当我写到RAI对一条规则的解释时，我将拉开帷幕，让你知道D&D团队在编写某条规则时是什么意思。",
	"Regardless of what's on the page or what the designers intended, D&D is meant to be fun, and the DM is the ringmaster at each game table. The best DMs shape the game on the fly to bring the most delight to their players. Such DMs aim for RAF, \"rules as fun.\" We expect DMs to depart from the rules when running a particular campaign or when seeking the greatest happiness for a certain group of players. Sometimes my rules answers will include advice on achieving the RAF interpretation of a rule for your group.": "无论页面上的内容或设计者的意图是什么，D&D都是为了好玩，而DM是每个游戏桌上的指挥者。最好的管理人在飞行中塑造游戏，给他们的玩家带来最大的快乐。这种DM的目标是RAF，即 \"作为乐趣的规则\"。我们希望DM在运行一个特定的活动时，或者在为某一群玩家寻求最大的快乐时，能够偏离规则。有时，我的规则答案会包括关于为你的团体实现规则的RAF解释的建议。",
	"I recommend a healthy mix of RAW, RAI, and RAF!": "我建议将RAW、RAI和RAF健康地混合在一起!",
	"{@book Chapter 1|PHB|1|Armor Class} of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} describes how to determine AC, yet AC calculations generate questions frequently. That fact isn't too surprising, given the number of ways the game gives you to change your AC! Here are some ways to calculate your base AC:": "{@book Chapter 1|PHB|1|Armor Class}中描述了如何确定AC，然而AC的计算却经常产生问题。这一事实并不太令人惊讶，因为游戏给你提供了很多改变AC的方法！你可以通过以下方法来改变你的AC。这里有一些计算你的基本AC的方法。",
	"10 + your Dexterity modifier.": "10+你的灵巧修改器。",
	"Use the AC entry for the armor you're wearing (see PHB, \"{@book Armor and Shields|PHB|5|Armor and Shields}\"). For example, in leather armor, you calculate your AC as 11 + your Dexterity modifier, and in chain mail, your AC is simply 16.": "使用你所穿的盔甲的AC条目（见PHB，\"（%0%）\"）。例如，穿皮甲时，你的AC值为11+你的灵巧修正值，而穿链甲时，你的AC值为16。",
	"10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier.": "10+你的灵巧修改器+你的宪法修改器。",
	"10 + your Dexterity modifier + your Wisdom modifier.": "10+你的灵巧修改器+你的智慧修改器。",
	"13 + your Dexterity modifier.": "13+你的灵巧修改器。",
	"10 + your Dexterity modifier + your natural armor bonus. This is a calculation method typically used only by monsters and NPCs, although it is also relevant to a druid or another character who assumes a form that has natural armor.": "10+你的灵巧修正值+你的自然护甲奖励。这是一种通常只由怪物和NPC使用的计算方法，尽管它也与德鲁伊或其他拥有自然护甲的角色有关。",
	"These methods—along with any others that give you a formula for calculating your AC—are mutually exclusive; you can benefit from only one at a time. If you have access to more than one, you pick which one to use. For example, if you're a sorcerer/monk, you can use either Unarmored Defense or Draconic Resilience, not both. Similarly, a druid/ barbarian who transforms into a beast form that has natural armor can use either the beast's natural armor or Unarmored Defense (you aren't considered to be wearing armor when you use natural armor).": "这些方法--以及任何其他给你计算AC的公式--是相互排斥的；你一次只能从一个方法中受益。如果你有机会使用多个方法，你可以选择使用哪一个。例如，如果你是一个巫师/僧侣，你可以使用 \"无甲防御 \"或 \"龙族恢复力\"，而不能同时使用。同样地，德鲁伊/野蛮人如果变身为有天然护甲的野兽形态，可以使用野兽的天然护甲或无护甲防御（当你使用天然护甲时，你不被认为是在穿护甲）。",
	"What about a shield? A shield increases your AC by 2 while you use it. For example, if you're unarmored and use a shield, your AC is 12 + your Dexterity modifier. Keep in mind that some AC calculations, such as a monk's Unarmored Defense, prohibit the use of a shield.": "盾牌呢？盾牌在你使用它的时候会增加你的AC值2。例如，如果你没有盔甲并使用盾牌，你的攻击力是12+你的灵巧修正值。请记住，有些AC计算方法，例如僧侣的无甲防御，禁止使用盾牌。",
	"Once you have your base AC, it can be temporarily modified by situational bonuses and penalties. For instance, having half cover gives you a +2 bonus to your AC, and three-quarters cover gives a +5 bonus. Spells sometimes modify AC as well. {@spell Shield of faith}, for example, grants a target a +2 bonus to AC until the spell ends.": "一旦你有了你的基本攻击力，它就可以被情况下的奖励和惩罚暂时修改。例如，有一半的遮蔽物会给你的AC值带来+2的奖励，而四分之三的遮蔽物会带来+5的奖励。法术有时也会修改AC。例如，{@spell Shield of faith}，给予目标一个+2的AC奖励，直到咒语结束。",
	"Magic items can also enhance your AC. Here are a few examples: {@item +1 chain mail} gives you an AC of 17, a {@item ring of protection} gives you a +1 bonus to AC no matter what you're wearing, and {@item bracers of defense} grant you a +2 bonus to AC if you're not wearing armor or using a shield.": "魔法物品也可以加强你的交流。这里有几个例子。{@item +1 chain mail}给你一个17的AC，一个{@item ring of protection}给你一个+1的AC奖励，无论你穿什么，{@item bracers of defense}给你一个+2的AC奖励，如果你不穿盔甲或使用盾牌。",
	"If an elf meditates during a long rest (as described in the Trance trait), the elf finishes the rest after only 4 hours. A meditating elf otherwise follows all the rules for a long rest; only the duration is changed.": "如果一个精灵在长时间的休息中进行冥想（如恍惚特性所描述的），那么这个精灵在4小时后就完成了休息。冥想中的精灵在其他方面遵循所有长期休息的规则；只有持续时间被改变。",
	"The lightfoot halfling and wood elf traits—Naturally Stealthy and Mask of the Wild—do allow members of those subraces to try to hide in their special circumstances even when observers are nearby. Normally, you can't hide from someone if you're in full view. A lightfoot halfling, though, can try to vanish behind a creature that is at least one size larger, and a wood elf can try to hide simply by being in heavy rain, mist, falling snow, foliage, or similar natural phenomena. It's as if nature itself cloaks a wood elf from prying eyes—even eyes staring right at the elf! Both subraces are capable of hiding in situations when most other creatures can't, but neither subrace's hiding attempt is assured of success; a Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check is required as normal, and an observant foe might later spot a hidden halfling or elf: \"I see you behind that guard, you tricksy halfling!\"": "光脚半身人和木精灵的特性--自然隐身和野性面具--允许这些子种族的成员在他们的特殊情况下尝试隐藏，即使观察者在附近。通常情况下，如果你在众目睽睽之下，你是无法躲避别人的。不过，一个轻足半身人可以尝试消失在一个至少大一号的生物后面，而一个木精灵可以通过在大雨、薄雾、落雪、树叶或类似的自然现象中尝试隐藏。就好像自然界本身为木精灵披上了隐身衣，使其免受窥视--甚至是盯着精灵的眼睛！这就是木精灵的魅力所在。这两个亚族都能在大多数其他生物无法躲藏的情况下躲藏起来，但是这两个亚族的躲藏尝试都不能保证成功；需要像平常一样进行灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）检查，观察力强的敌人后来可能会发现一个隐藏的半身人或精灵。\"我看到你在那个警卫后面了，你这个狡猾的半身人！\"",
	"A dragonborn sorcerer can choose a different ancestor for the racial trait and for the Dragon Ancestor feature. Your choice for the racial trait is your actual ancestor, while the choice for the class feature could be your ancestor figuratively—the type of dragon that bestowed magic upon you or your family or the kind of draconic artifact or location that filled you with magical energy.": "龙裔巫师可以为种族特征和龙族祖先特征选择一个不同的祖先。你对种族特征的选择是你真正的祖先，而对类别特征的选择则可以是你的祖先，即赋予你或你的家族以魔法的龙的类型，或使你充满魔法能量的龙族神器或地点。",
	"Unless a feature says otherwise, temporary hit points last until you finish a long rest (PH, 198).": "除非特征另有规定，临时命中率会持续到你完成一次长时休息（PH，198）。",
	"Magical darkness blocks {@sense darkvision} only if the rules text for a particular instance of darkness says it does. For example, the darkness spell specifies that it produces a magical darkness that obstructs {@sense darkvision}. That obstruction is a feature of the spell, not of magical darkness in general.": "魔法黑暗只有在特定的黑暗实例的规则文本中说它会阻挡（%0%）。例如，黑暗法术规定它产生的魔法黑暗会阻挡（%1%）。这种阻挡是该咒语的特征，而不是一般的魔法黑暗的特征。",
	"Extra Attack imposes no limitation on what you use for the attacks. You can use regular weapons, improvised weapons, unarmed strikes, or a combination of these options for the attacks.": "额外攻击对你使用的攻击方式没有限制。你可以使用普通武器、简易武器、徒手攻击或这些选项的组合进行攻击。",
	"You use Flash of Genius immediately after the triggering {@dice d20} is rolled and before any of the effects of the roll are applied. Unless a rule tells you otherwise, a reaction occurs immediately after its trigger.": "你在触发{@dice d20}的卷轴之后，在卷轴的任何效果被应用之前，立即使用 \"天才之光\"。除非有规则告诉你，一个反应在其触发后立即发生。",
	"Activating a Spell-Storing Item uses the Use an Object action.": "激活一个储存法术的物品需要使用 \"使用物品 \"动作。",
	"No. An infusion lasts until one of the circumstances described in the \"Infusing an Item\" section of the Infuse Item feature.": "输液持续到输液功能的 \"输液 \"部分所描述的情况之一。",
	"A barbarian's Danger Sense benefits the Dexterity saving throw against any effect that the barbarian can see.": "野蛮人的危险感应有利于对野蛮人所能看到的任何效果进行灵巧救赎。",
	"If you use the barbarian's Reckless Attack, all attack rolls have advantage against you until the start of your next turn.": "如果你使用野蛮人的鲁莽攻击，所有的攻击卷都对你有利，直到你下一回合开始。",
	"Yes, different effects stack if they don't have the same name. If a creature makes an ability check while it is under the effect of a {@spell guidance} spell and also has a Bardic Inspiration die, it can roll both a {@dice d4} and a {@dice d6} if it so chooses.": "是的，不同的效果如果不具有相同的名称，则可以叠加。如果一个生物在受到{@spell guidance}法术的影响时进行能力检定，并且也有一个吟游诗人的灵感模子，如果它选择的话，它可以同时掷出{@dice d4}和{@dice d6}。",
	"You can wait to use Cutting Words after the roll, but you must commit to doing so before you know for sure whether the total of the roll or check is a success or a failure. You can use Cutting Words to reduce the damage from any effect that calls for a damage roll (including {@spell magic missile}) even if the damage roll is not preceded by an attack roll.": "你可以在掷骰子之后再使用切割之语，但你必须在确定掷骰子或检查的总数是成功还是失败之前就承诺这样做。你可以使用切割之语来减少任何需要伤害卷的效果的伤害（包括（%0%）），即使伤害卷之前没有攻击卷。",
	"When you gain a level in the bard class, the class's Spellcasting feature lets you replace one bard spell you know with another bard spell of an appropriate level. A spell learned through your Magical Secrets feature counts as a bard spell for you, so it can be replaced upon gaining a bard level later. But it must be replaced by a bard spell, according to the rule in the Spellcasting feature.": "当你在吟游诗人等级中获得一个等级时，该等级的咒语功能可以让你用另一个相应等级的吟游诗人法术来替换你所知道的一个吟游诗人法术。通过你的魔法秘密功能学到的咒语对你来说算作一个吟游诗人的咒语，所以它可以在以后获得吟游诗人等级时被替换。但根据咒语功能的规则，它必须被一个吟游诗人的法术所取代。",
	"A bard can use any {@item spell scroll} that has a bard spell on it—including spells gained from the Magical Secrets feature, which are treated as bard spells for that character.": "吟游诗人可以使用任何带有吟游诗人法术的（%0%）--包括从魔法秘密特征中获得的法术，这些法术对该角色来说被视为吟游诗人法术。",
	"{@class Cleric||Destructive Wrath|Tempest} is meant to maximize lightning and thunder damage only.": "{@class Cleric||Destructive Wrath|Tempest}是为了最大限度地提高闪电和雷电伤害。",
	"No. Only a creature with 0 hit points benefits from the hit-point-restoration portion of the Circle of Mortality feature.": "不，只有命中率为0的生物才能从死亡之环的命中率恢复部分中获益。",
	"The druid explodes.": "德鲁伊爆炸了。",
	"Well, not actually. Druids have a taboo against wearing metal armor and wielding a metal shield. The taboo has been part of the class's story since the class first appeared in {@i Eldritch Wizardry} (1976) and the original {@i Player's Handbook} (1978). The idea is that druids prefer to be protected by animal skins, wood, and other natural materials that aren't the worked metal that is associated with civilization. Druids don't lack the ability to wear metal armor. They choose not to wear it. This choice is part of their identity as a mystical order. Think of it in these terms: a vegetarian can eat meat, but chooses not to.": "嗯，实际上不是。德鲁伊有一个禁忌，就是不能穿金属盔甲和挥舞金属盾牌。自从德鲁伊首次出现在{@i Eldritch Wizardry}(1976)和原始的{@i Player's Handbook}(1978)中，这个禁忌就一直是这个等级故事的一部分。这个想法是，德鲁伊更喜欢用兽皮、木材和其他自然材料来保护自己，而不是与文明相关的加工金属。德鲁伊并不缺乏穿金属盔甲的能力。他们选择不穿它。这种选择是他们作为一个神秘教团身份的一部分。可以这样想：一个素食者可以吃肉，但选择不吃。",
	"A druid typically wears {@item Leather Armor|PHB|leather}, {@item Studded Leather Armor|PHB|studded leather}, or {@item Hide Armor|PHB|hide} armor, and if a druid comes across {@item scale mail|PHB} made of a material other than metal, the druid might wear it. If you feel strongly about your druid breaking the taboo and donning metal, talk to your DM. Each class has story elements mixed with its game features; the two types of design go hand in hand in D&D, and the story parts are stronger in some classes than in others. Druids and paladins have an especially strong dose of story in their design. If you want to depart from your class's story, your DM has the final say on how far you can go and still be considered a member of the class. As long as you abide by your character's proficiencies, you're not going to break anything in the game system, but you might undermine the story and the world being created in your campaign.": "德鲁伊通常穿着（%0%）、（%1%）或（%2%）的盔甲，如果德鲁伊遇到了由金属以外的材料制成的（%3%），德鲁伊可能会穿着它。如果你强烈要求你的德鲁伊打破禁忌，穿上金属，请与你的管理员商量。每个等级都有故事元素和游戏特征；这两种设计在D&D中是相辅相成的，而故事部分在某些等级中比其他等级更强。德鲁伊和圣骑士的设计中的故事性特别强。如果你想偏离你的阶级的故事，你的管理员对你能走多远并且仍然被认为是该阶级的成员有最终决定权。只要你遵守你的角色的能力，你就不会破坏游戏系统中的任何东西，但你可能会破坏故事和你的活动中创造的世界。",
	"Transforming into a different size can be an effective way of escaping, depending on the nature of the bonds or confinement. All things considered, someone trying to keep a druid captive might be wise to stash the prisoner in a room with an opening only large enough for air to enter.": "根据束缚或禁锢的性质，变身为不同的体型可以是一种有效的逃跑方式。综上所述，试图囚禁德鲁伊的人可能会明智地将囚犯藏在一个开口只够空气进入的房间里。",
	"The creatures listed in Elemental Wild Shape—{@creature Air Elemental||air}, {@creature Earth Elemental||earth}, {@creature Fire Elemental||fire}, and {@creature Water Elemental||water} elementals—are specific creatures in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}, not creature types or subtypes. Elemental Wild Shape allows you to transform into one of those creatures.": "元素狂野之形中列出的生物--{@creature Air Elemental||air}、{@creature Earth Elemental||earth}、{@creature Fire Elemental||fire}和{@creature Water Elemental||water}元素--是{@book Monster Manual|MM}中的特定生物，而不是生物类型或次类型。元素野性之形允许你转化为这些生物中的一种。",
	"Yes, since the elementals listed in Elemental Wild Shape can speak.": "是的，因为《元素野性之形》中列出的元素可以说话。",
	"A literal interpretation (RAW) of Wild Shape could reasonably lead you to think that transformed druids can speak only languages that appear in an elemental's stat block, but the intent (RAI) is that druids retain their knowledge, including of languages, when they transform and can speak the languages they know if an adopted form can speak.": "对 \"野性之形 \"的字面解释（RAW）可以合理地让你认为，变身后的德鲁伊只能说元素属性块中出现的语言，但本意（RAI）是德鲁伊在变身时保留他们的知识，包括语言，并且如果采用的形态可以说话，他们就可以说他们知道的语言。",
	"A druid can cast spells in a Wild Shape form only upon gaining the Beast Spells feature at 18th level.": "德鲁伊只有在18级获得野兽法术特性时才能以野性形态施展法术。",
	"A druid's Ritual Casting requires a ritual to be prepared. The spell from Magic Initiate is known but not prepared.": "德鲁伊的 \"仪式施法 \"需要准备一个仪式。魔法入门中的咒语是已知的，但没有准备好。",
	"Action Surge gives you an extra action, not an extra bonus action. (Recent printings of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} no longer include the wording that provoked this question.)": "行动激增给你一个额外的行动，而不是一个额外的奖励行动。(最近印刷的（%0%）不再包括引起这个问题的措辞）。",
	"Dueling and Defense, for example. You can benefit from more than one Fighting Style option at a time, as long as they don't have conflicting requirements, as Dueling and Great Weapon Fighting do.": "例如，决斗和防御。你可以同时从一个以上的战斗风格选项中受益，只要它们没有冲突的要求，就像决斗和大武器战斗那样。",
	"No, the Archery feature benefits ranged weapons. A melee weapon, such as a {@item dagger|PHB} or {@item handaxe|PHB}, is still a melee weapon when you make a {@book ranged attack|PHB|9|Ranged Attacks} with it.": "不，射箭功能有利于远程武器。一个近战武器，例如{@item dagger|PHB}或{@item handaxe|PHB}，当你用它做一个{@book ranged attack|PHB|9|Ranged Attacks}时，仍然是一个近战武器。",
	"Yes. A character with the Dueling option usually pairs a one-handed weapon with a {@item shield|PHB}, a spellcasting focus, or a free hand.": "是的。拥有决斗选项的角色通常会将单手武器与一个（%0%）、一个施法焦点或一只自由手配对。",
	"The Great Weapon Fighting feature—which is shared by fighters and paladins—is meant to benefit only the damage roll of the weapon used with the feature. For example, if you use a {@item greatsword|PHB} with the feature, you can reroll any 1 or 2 you roll on the weapon's {@dice 2d6}. If you're a paladin and use Divine Smite with the greatsword, Great Weapon Fighting doesn't let you reroll a 1 or 2 that you roll for the damage of Divine Smite.": "伟大的武器战斗特性--由战士和圣骑士共享--是为了只让与该特性一起使用的武器的伤害卷受益。例如，如果你使用{@item greatsword|PHB}的功能，你可以在武器的{@dice 2d6}上重掷任何1或2。如果你是一个圣骑士并使用大剑的 \"神圣打击\"，\"伟大的武器战斗 \"不会让你为 \"神圣打击 \"的伤害重选1或2。",
	"Yes, you can use the {@class Fighter||Riposte|Battle Master} maneuver in response to an {@book opportunity attack|PHB|9|Opportunity Attacks} that misses you, assuming your {@book reaction|PHB|9|Reactions} is available.": "是的，你可以使用{@class Fighter||Riposte|Battle Master}机动性来应对错过你的{@book opportunity attack|PHB|9|Opportunity Attacks}，前提是你的{@book reaction|PHB|9|Reactions}可用。",
	"The bonus action comes after the cantrip, since using your action to cast a cantrip is what gives you the ability to make the weapon attack as a bonus action. That said, a DM would break nothing in the system by allowing an Eldritch Knight to reverse the order of the cantrip and the weapon attack.": "奖励动作在咒语之后，因为使用你的动作来施放咒语才使你有能力作为奖励动作进行武器攻击。也就是说，如果管理员允许长老骑士颠倒施放咒语和武器攻击的顺序，就不会破坏系统中的任何规定。",
	"No. The attack from War Magic is made normally, and you get the benefit of {@spell true strike} on your next turn if the spell hasn't ended.": "不，战争魔法的攻击是正常进行的，如果咒语还没有结束，你在下一回合会得到（%0%）的好处。",
	"No. Disarming {@action Attack} forces a creature to drop an object it is holding. Donned shields aren't merely held.": "不，解除武装{@action Attack}迫使一个生物放弃它所持有的物体。戴上的盾牌并不只是持有。",
	"Yes. A monk weapon must lack the two-handed property, but nothing prevents a monk from wielding such a weapon with two hands. Fundamentally, a monk weapon counts as such no matter how a monk uses it.": "是的。僧侣武器必须缺乏双手属性，但没有什么能阻止僧侣用双手挥舞这种武器。从根本上说，无论僧侣如何使用，僧侣武器都是如此。",
	"Starting equipment often lends versatility to a character. In this case, a monk's {@item Dart|PHB|darts} provide a ranged attack option, not a Martial Arts option.": "起步装备往往使一个角色具有多功能性。在这种情况下，和尚的（%0%）提供了一个远程攻击的选择，而不是一个武术的选择。",
	"No. The feature grants a benefit that is similar to the finesse property, but the feature doesn't confer that property.": "不，该特征赋予了一个类似于精巧属性的好处，但该特征并不赋予该属性。",
	"A missile counts as a monk weapon if it is thrown using Deflect Missiles; it deals its damage or Martial Arts damage (the monk's choice).": "如果使用 \"偏转导弹 \"投掷导弹，则该导弹算作僧侣武器；它造成其伤害或武术伤害（由僧侣选择）。",
	"Yes. Stunning Strike works with melee weapon attacks, and an unarmed strike is a special type of melee weapon attack.": "是的，眩晕攻击适用于近战武器攻击，而徒手攻击是一种特殊类型的近战武器攻击。",
	"The game often makes exceptions to general rules, and this is an important exception: that unarmed strikes count as melee weapon attacks despite not being weapons.": "游戏经常对一般规则做出例外，这是一个重要的例外：尽管不是武器，但徒手打击也算作近战武器攻击。",
	"Yes. The {@condition invisible|phb|invisibility} of the monk's Empty Body isn't ended by the monk attacking.": "是的，和尚空身的（%0%）并不因和尚的攻击而结束。",
	"That feature grants immunity to both. As a result, a monk with Purity of Body can, for example, inhale a {@creature Young Green Dragon||green dragon's} poison breath unharmed. Similarly, the monk is unaffected by {@spell ray of sickness}, which both deals poison damage and imposes the {@condition poisoned} condition.": "该功能对两者都有免疫力。因此，一个拥有 \"身体纯净 \"的僧侣可以，例如，吸入{@creature Young Green Dragon||green dragon's}的毒气而不受伤害。同样地，僧侣不受{@spell ray of sickness}的影响，而{@spell ray of sickness}会造成毒药伤害并施加{@condition poisoned}条件。",
	"The Open Hand Technique intentionally ignores creature size. A monk's ki fuels many extraordinary effects! If a feature is limited by creature size, the feature tells you so.": "张开手的技巧有意忽略了生物的大小。僧侣的气力为许多非凡的效果提供动力。如果一项功能受到生物体型的限制，该功能会告诉你。",
	"No. The ki point cost in the feature applies only to the other spells in it.": "不，特征中的基点成本只适用于其中的其他法术。",

	"A {@race tiefling} is a humanoid, not a fiend, and therefore escapes the notice of Divine Sense. The feature detects creatures that have the celestial, fiend, or undead creature type.": "A {@race tiefling}是一个人形生物，而不是一个魔族，因此能逃过神识的注意。该功能可以探测到具有天体、魔族或不死生物类型的生物。",
	"Yes, you can use Divine Smite on the same weapon attack that benefits from a smite spell, such as {@spell wrathful smite}—as long as the attack you make after casting the smite spell is a melee weapon attack. Divine Smite doesn't work with any other kind of attack.": "是的，你可以在同样的武器攻击上使用神力打击，这些武器攻击可以从神力打击法术中获益，比如（%0%）--只要你在施放神力打击法术后的攻击是近战武器攻击。神圣打击对任何其他类型的攻击都不起作用。",
	"No. Divine Smite requires a melee attack using a weapon. The rules don't consider unarmed strikes to be weapons.": "不，\"神圣打击 \"需要使用武器进行近战攻击。规则不认为徒手攻击是武器。",
	"Divine Smite does work with a melee weapon attack, and an unarmed strike can be used to make such an attack. But the text of Divine Smite also refers to the \"weapon's damage,\" and an unarmed strike isn't a weapon.": "神圣打击确实对近战武器攻击有效，而且徒手打击可以用来进行这样的攻击。但 \"神圣打击 \"的文字也提到了 \"武器的伤害\"，而徒手打击并不是武器。",
	"If a DM decides to override this rule, no imbalance is created. Tying Divine Smite to weapons was a thematic choice on our part—paladins being traditionally associated with weapons. It was not a game balance choice.": "如果管理员决定推翻这一规则，就不会产生不平衡。将 \"神圣打击 \"与武器联系起来是我们的一个主题选择--传统上，圣骑士与武器有关。这不是一个游戏平衡的选择。",
	"Like other spellcasters, the ranger follows the rule on {@book components|PHB|10|Components} in chapter 10 of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}. A ranger typically uses a component pouch for the material components of spells, but doesn't start with one because rangers don't have spells at 1st level.": "和其他法术师一样，游侠也遵循《{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}》第十章中关于{@book components|PHB|10|Components}的规则。游侠通常使用组件袋来存放法术的材料成分，但由于游侠在1级时没有法术，所以没有开始使用组件袋。",
	"No. Whirlwind Attack is unusual, in that it's a single attack with multiple attack rolls. In most other instances, an attack has one attack roll. The rule on moving between attacks ({@i PHB}, \"{@book Moving Between Attacks|PHB|9|Moving between Attacks}\") lets you move between weapon attacks, not between the attack rolls of an exceptional feature like Whirlwind Attack.": "不，旋风攻击是不寻常的，因为它是一个有多个攻击卷的单一攻击。在大多数其他情况下，一次攻击有一个攻击卷。在攻击之间移动的规则（{@i PHB}, \"{@book Moving Between Attacks|PHB|9|Moving between Attacks}\"）让你在武器攻击之间移动，而不是在像旋风攻击这种特殊功能的攻击卷之间移动。",

	"You sometimes get a chance to use Sneak Attack on someone else's turn. The most common way for this to happen is when a foe provokes an opportunity attack from you. If the requirements for Sneak Attack are met, your opportunity attack can benefit from that feature. Similarly, a fighter could use Commander's Strike to grant you an attack on the fighter's turn, and if the attack qualifies, it can use Sneak Attack. Both of those options rely on the use of your {@book reaction|PHB|9|Reactions}, so you could do only one of them in a round.": "你有时会有机会在别人的回合中使用偷袭。最常见的情况是，当一个敌人挑起你的机会攻击时。如果满足了偷袭的要求，你的机会攻击就可以从该特性中获益。同样地，一个战士可以使用指挥官的打击，在战士的回合给予你一次攻击，如果攻击符合要求，就可以使用偷袭。这两个选项都依赖于你的（%0%）的使用，所以你在一个回合中只能做其中一个。",
	"Because you get only one {@book reaction|PHB|9|Reactions} per round, you're unlikely to use Sneak Attack more than twice in a round: once with your action and once with your reaction.": "因为你每回合只得到一次（%0%），所以你不太可能在一回合内使用偷袭两次以上：一次是你的行动，一次是你的反应。",
	"The 5-foot limitation in Sneak Attack is unaffected by the reach of a weapon. That other enemy of the target is creating a close-up distraction, regardless of the weapon in hand.": "偷袭中的5英尺限制不受武器范围的影响。目标的那个其他敌人正在创造一个近距离的分心，不管手中的武器是什么。",
	"A use of Uncanny Dodge works against only one attack, since it expends your {@book reaction|PHB|9|Reactions}, and only if you can see the attacker. It works against attacks of all sorts, including spell attacks, but it is no help against a spell or other effect, such as {@spell fireball}, that delivers its damage after a saving throw rather than after an attack roll.": "使用不思议闪避只对一次攻击有效，因为它消耗了你的（%0%），而且只有在你能看到攻击者的情况下。它对各种攻击都有效，包括法术攻击，但对法术或其他效果没有帮助，比如（1%），它是在蓄力后而不是在攻击卷后造成伤害。",

	"That's correct. Elemental Affinity benefits one damage roll per casting of a spell, even if the spell allows more than one roll. So, for example, the feature improves one of the rays of a {@spell scorching ray} spell or one of the beams of an {@spell eldritch blast} spell.": "那是正确的。元素亲和力对每次施法的一个伤害卷有利，即使该法术允许多于一个卷。因此，举例来说，该功能可以提高{@spell scorching ray}法术的一个射线或{@spell eldritch blast}法术的一个光束。",
	"A sorcerer's Empowered Spell could affect more than one ray of a {@spell scorching ray}, abiding by the feature's die limit. For instance, if you create three rays with the spell and you have a +3 Charisma modifier, you could reroll one of the damage dice for each ray, or two of the damage dice for one ray and one of the damage dice for another one.": "巫师的赋能法术可以影响一个以上的射线（%0%），遵守该特征的骰子限制。例如，如果你用这个咒语创造了三条射线，并且你有+3的魅力修正值，你可以为每条射线重掷一个伤害骰子，或者为一条射线重掷两个伤害骰子，为另一条射线重掷一个伤害骰子。",
	"No, the sorcerer must follow the rule for casting a spell as a bonus action and casting another spell on the same turn; the other spell must be a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.": "不，巫师必须遵循作为额外行动施放一个法术并在同一回合施放另一个法术的规则；另一个法术必须是施放时间为1个行动的咒语。",
	"Yes, you can. It costs the number of sorcery points appropriate for the level of the spell you're duplicating.": "是的，你可以。它要花费与你所复制的咒语等级相适应的巫术点数。",
	"The spell and the {@table Wild Magic Surge|PHB} effect both happen. As clarified in the errata for the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, a surge effect that normally requires {@book concentration|PHB|10|Concentration} does not require concentration in this case.": "咒语和（%0%）的效果都会发生。如同{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}的勘误表所说明的，通常需要{@book concentration|PHB|10|Concentration}的激增效果在此情况下不需要专注。",
	"The spells granted by that feature aren't automatically known by a warlock. Those spells are added to the warlock spell list for the character, who can choose them when learning a new warlock spell of the appropriate level. Once learned, such a spell does count against the number of spells the warlock knows.": "该特征所赋予的法术并不自动被术士所知。这些法术被添加到角色的术士法术列表中，他可以在学习相应等级的新术士法术时选择这些法术。一旦学会，这种法术就会被计入术士所知道的法术数量。",

	"The warlock's Pact of the Blade feature lets you create a melee weapon out of nothing. Whenever you do so, you determine the weapon's form, choosing from the melee weapon options in the {@book Weapons table|PHB|5|Weapons} in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}. For example, you can create a {@item greataxe|PHB}, and then use the feature again to create a {@item javelin|PHB}, which causes the greataxe to disappear.": "术士的 \"刀之契约 \"功能让你无中生有地创造出一件近战武器。每当你这样做的时候，你会决定武器的形态，从{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的{@book Weapons table|PHB|5|Weapons}近战武器选项中选择。例如，你可以创造一个{@item greataxe|PHB}，然后再次使用该功能来创造一个{@item javelin|PHB}，这将使大斧消失。",
	"You can also use Pact of the Blade to bond with a magic weapon, turning it into your pact weapon. This magic weapon doesn't have to be a melee weapon, so you could use the feature on a {@item +1 longbow}, for instance. Once the bond is formed, the magic weapon appears whenever you call your pact weapon to you, and you can't change the magic weapon's form when it appears. For example, if you bond with a {@item Flame Tongue Longsword||flame tongue (longsword)} and send the weapon to an extradimensional space, the weapon comes back as a longsword when you summon it. You don't get to turn it into a club. Similarly, if you bond with a {@item dagger of venom}, you can't summon it as a maul; it's always a dagger.": "你也可以使用 \"刀之契约 \"与一件魔法武器结合，把它变成你的契约武器。这个魔法武器不一定是近战武器，所以你可以把这个功能用在（%0%）上，比如说。一旦结合形成，只要你召唤你的契约武器，这个魔法武器就会出现，而且当它出现时你不能改变魔法武器的形式。例如，如果你与一个{@item Flame Tongue Longsword||flame tongue (longsword)}的法宝结合，并把法宝送到一个次元空间，当你召唤它时，法宝就会以长剑的形式回来。你不能把它变成一根棍子。同样地，如果你与{@item dagger of venom}结合，你不能把它召唤为大锤；它总是一把匕首。",
	"The feature allows the conjuring forth of a melee weapon, yet we allow more versatility when it comes to magic weapons. We didn't want a narrow focus in this feature to make a warlock unhappy when a variety of magic weapons appear in a campaign. Does this versatility extend outside the melee theme of the feature? It sure does, but we're willing to occasionally bend a design concept if doing so is likely to increase a player's happiness.": "该功能允许召唤出近战武器，但当涉及到魔法武器时，我们允许更多的多样性。我们不希望在这个功能中出现一个狭窄的焦点，使术士在战役中出现各种魔法武器时不高兴。这种多功能性是否延伸到该功能的近战主题之外？当然是的，但是如果这样做有可能增加玩家的快乐，我们愿意偶尔弯曲一个设计概念。",
	"Yes. Someone other than the warlock can use a pact weapon before the weapon disappears.": "是的，术士以外的人可以在武器消失之前使用契约武器。",
	"The feature is intended to provide one-way communication. The warlock can use the feature to speak telepathically to a creature, but the feature doesn't give that creature the ability to telepathically reply.

	"The first benefit of the feat lets you ignore the loading property of the {@item hand crossbow|PHB} if you're proficient with that weapon. The upshot is that you can fire it more than once if you have a feature like Extra Attack. You're still limited, however, by the fact that the weapon has the ammunition property. The latter property requires you to have a bolt to fire from the {@item hand crossbow|PHB}, and the hand crossbow isn't going to load itself (unless it's magical or a gnomish invention). You need to load each bolt into the weapon, and doing so requires a hand.": "该特技的第一个好处是，如果你精通该武器，可以忽略（%0%）的装填属性。其结果是，如果你有额外攻击这样的功能，你可以多次发射。然而，你仍然受到武器具有弹药属性这一事实的限制。后者的属性要求你必须有枪栓来发射（%1%），而手弩是不会自己装弹的（除非它是魔法或地精的发明）。你需要将每根弩箭装入武器，而这样做需要一只手。",
	"To dig deeper into this point, take a look at the following sentence in the definition of the ammunition property: \"Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack.\" The sentence tells us two important things. First, you're assumed to be drawing—that is, extracting with your hand—the ammunition from a container. Second, the act of drawing the ammunition is included in the attack and therefore doesn't require its own action and doesn't use up your free interaction with an object on your turn.": "为了更深入地挖掘这一点，请看一下弹药属性定义中的以下句子。\"从箭筒、箱子或其他容器中提取弹药是攻击的一部分。\" 这句话告诉我们两件重要的事情。首先，你被认为是在抽取--即用你的手将弹药从容器中取出。第二，拔出弹药的行为包括在攻击中，因此不需要自己的行动，也不会占用你在回合中与一个物体的自由互动。",
	"What does that all mean for a {@item hand crossbow|PHB}?

	"It does! Take a look at the feat's third benefit. It says you can attack with a hand crossbow as a bonus action when you use the {@action Attack} action to attack with a one-handed weapon. A {@item hand crossbow|PHB} is a one-handed weapon, so it can, indeed, be used for both attacks, assuming you have a hand free to load the hand crossbow between the two attacks.": "它是这样的! 看一下该特技的第三个好处。它说当你使用{@action Attack}动作用单手武器攻击时，你可以用手弩作为额外动作。{@item hand crossbow|PHB}是一种单手武器，所以它确实可以用于两次攻击，前提是在两次攻击之间你有一只手可以给手弩装子弹。",

	"The {@feat Lucky} feat represents extraordinary luck that can help you when you need it most. It lets you spend a luck point; roll an extra {@dice d20} for an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw; and then choose which {@dice d20} to use. This is true no matter how many d20s are in the mix. For example, if you have advantage or disadvantage on your attack roll, you could spend a luck point, roll a third {@dice d20}, and then decide which of the three dice to use. You still have advantage or disadvantage, since the feat doesn't say it negates it, but you get to pick the die. The upshot of this fact is that a rogue, for instance, who has disadvantage on an attack roll couldn't use Sneak Attack even if the rogue uses the Lucky feat to pick the die.": "{@feat Lucky}特技代表了非凡的运气，可以在你最需要它的时候帮助你。它可以让你花费一个运气点；为攻击卷、能力检查或蓄力投掷掷出一个额外的（%1%）；然后选择使用哪个（%2%）。无论有多少个D20都是如此。例如，如果你在攻击卷上有优势或劣势，你可以花一个运气点，掷第三个（%3%），然后决定使用这三个骰子中的哪一个。你仍然有优势或劣势，因为这个特技并没有说它否定了优势或劣势，但你可以挑选骰子。这个事实的结果是，比如说，一个流氓在攻击卷上有劣势，就不能使用偷袭，即使这个流氓使用幸运特技来挑选骰子。",
	"The {@feat Lucky} feat is a great example of an exception to a general rule. The general rule in this case is the one that tells us how advantage and disadvantage work. The specific rule is the Lucky feat, and we know that a specific rule trumps a general rule if they conflict with each other.": "{@feat Lucky}的壮举是一个很好的例子，说明一般规则的例外。本例中的一般规则是告诉我们优势和劣势是如何发挥作用的。具体的规则是 \"幸运 \"特技，我们知道，如果具体规则与一般规则相冲突，那么具体规则将战胜一般规则。",
	"If a DM wants advantage and disadvantage to play their normal roles even when the {@feat Lucky} feat is used, here's a way to do so: roll two d20s for advantage/disadvantage, roll a third {@dice d20} for Lucky, eliminate one of the three dice, and then use the higher (for advantage) or lower (for disadvantage) of the two dice that remain.": "如果DM想让优势和劣势在使用{@feat Lucky}特技时也能发挥正常的作用，这里有一个方法：掷两个D20表示优势/劣势，掷第三个{@dice d20}表示幸运，消除三个骰子中的一个，然后用剩下的两个骰子中较高的（表示优势）或较低的（表示劣势）。",
	"Yes, the feat doesn't say you can't. For example, if you're a wizard and gain the {@feat Magic Initiate} feat, you can choose wizard and thereby learn two more wizard cantrips and another 1st-level wizard spell.": "是的，这个特技并没有说你不能。例如，如果你是一个巫师并获得了（%0%）的特技，你可以选择巫师，从而再学习两个巫师咒语和另一个一级巫师法术。",
	"Yes, but only if the class you pick for the feat is one of your classes. For example, if you pick sorcerer and you are a sorcerer, the Spellcasting feature for that class tells you that you can use your spell slots to cast the sorcerer spells you know, so you can use your spell slots to cast the 1st-level sorcerer spell you learn from {@feat Magic Initiate}. Similarly, if you are a wizard and pick that class for the feat, you learn a 1st-level wizard spell, which you could add to your spellbook and subsequently prepare.": "是的，但是只有当你为该特技选择的等级是你的等级之一时。例如，如果你选择了巫师，而你是一个巫师，该类别的法术特性告诉你，你可以用你的法术槽来施放你所知道的巫师法术，所以你可以用你的法术槽来施放你所学的一级巫师法术（%0%）。同样地，如果你是个巫师，并选择该类别的特技，你就会学到一个1级的巫师法术，你可以将其加入你的法术书，并随后准备。",
	"In short, you must follow your character's normal spellcasting rules, which determine whether you can expend spell slots on the 1st-level spell you learn from Magic Initiate.": "简而言之，你必须遵循你的角色的正常施法规则，这决定了你是否可以将法术槽消耗在你从魔法入门学习的一级法术上。",
	"Yes. If you have the feat and use the {@action Attack} action to attack with a {@item glaive|PHB}, {@item halberd|PHB}, or {@item quarterstaff|PHB}, you can also strike with the weapon's opposite end as a bonus action. For that bonus attack, you add your ability modifier to the attack roll, as you do whenever you attack with that weapon, and if you hit, you add the same ability modifier to the damage roll, which is normal for weapon {@book damage rolls|PHB|9|Damage Rolls}.": "如果你有这个特技，并使用{@action Attack}动作来攻击{@item glaive|PHB}、{@item halberd|PHB}或{@item quarterstaff|PHB}，你也可以用该武器的另一端作为额外动作。对于该额外攻击，你在攻击卷上加上你的能力修改器，就像你每次用该武器攻击时一样，如果你击中了，你在伤害卷上加上同样的能力修改器，这对武器（%%4%）来说是正常的。",
	"A specific rule, such as the rule for {@book two-weapon fighting|PHB|9|Two-Weapon Fighting}, might break the general rule by telling you not to add your ability modifier to the damage. {@feat Polearm Master} doesn't have such a rule.": "一个特定的规则，例如{@book two-weapon fighting|PHB|9|Two-Weapon Fighting}的规则，可能会打破一般的规则，告诉你不要把你的能力修正值加到伤害上。{@feat Polearm Master}没有这样的规则。",
	"A creature doesn't provoke an opportunity attack if it is moved without the use of its movement, its action, or its {@book reaction|PHB|9|Reactions}. For example, the effect of the {@spell antipathy/sympathy} spell requires the target to use its movement, meaning that it would provoke opportunity attacks when it does so.": "如果一个生物在没有使用其移动、行动或其（%0%）的情况下被移动，就不会挑起机会攻击。例如，（1%）法术的效果需要目标使用其移动，这意味着当它这样做的时候会挑起机会攻击。",
	"Similarly, {@spell dissonant whispers} requires the target to move using its {@book reaction|PHB|9|Reactions} (if available), so that activity also provokes opportunity attacks. In contrast, a creature that's pushed by a {@spell gust of wind} spell does not provoke opportunity attacks.": "同样地，{@spell dissonant whispers}要求目标使用其{@book reaction|PHB|9|Reactions}移动（如果有的话），因此该活动也会引发机会攻击。相比之下，一个被（%2%）法术推动的生物不会引发机会攻击。",
	"No. {@feat Savage Attacker} relies on a weapon's damage dice, and an unarmed strike isn't a weapon (a point that was clarified in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} errata).": "不，{@feat Savage Attacker}依赖于武器的伤害骰子，而徒手攻击并不是武器（这一点在{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}勘误表中得到了澄清）。",
	"No. The benefit of {@feat Savage Attacker} applies only to rolls of the weapon's damage dice, not to any extra damage that a feature or other ability might grant.": "不，{@feat Savage Attacker}的好处只适用于武器的伤害骰子的滚动，而不是任何特征或其他能力可能给予的额外伤害。",
	"The bonus attack takes place after the triggering attack. Here's why: the feat doesn't specify the bonus attack's timing, and when a {@book reaction|PHB|9|Reactions} has no timing specified, the reaction occurs after its trigger finishes ({@i DMG}, \"{@book Adjudicating Reaction Timing|DMG|8|Adjudicating Reaction Timing}\"). In contrast, an {@book opportunity attack|PHB|9|Opportunity Attacks} specifically takes place before its trigger finishes—that is, right before the target creature leaves your reach.": "奖励攻击发生在触发的攻击之后。这就是原因：该特技没有指定奖励攻击的时间，当{@book reaction|PHB|9|Reactions}没有指定时间时，反应会在其触发结束后发生（{@i DMG}, \"{@book Adjudicating Reaction Timing|DMG|8|Adjudicating Reaction Timing}\"）。相比之下，{@book opportunity attack|PHB|9|Opportunity Attacks}则是在其触发结束之前发生的，也就是说，在目标生物离开你的范围之前。",
	"Does the character with the {@feat Sentinel} feat still get the opportunity attack? The second benefit of the Sentinel feat is intended to counteract the {@action Disengage} action only. An enemy with the Fancy Footwork feature ({@book Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|SCAG}) or one that has the {@feat Mobile} feat can avoid provoking opportunity attacks from someone who has the Sentinel feat, as long as that enemy doesn't take the {@action Disengage} action.": "拥有{@feat Sentinel}特技的角色是否还能得到机会攻击？哨兵特技的第二个好处只是为了对抗{@action Disengage}的行动。一个拥有花式步法（{@book Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|SCAG}）或拥有{@feat Mobile}特技的敌人可以避免从拥有哨兵特技的人那里挑起机会攻击，只要该敌人不采取{@action Disengage}行动。",
	"No. The bonus action provided by the {@feat Shield Master} feat has a precondition: that you take the {@action Attack} action on your turn. Intending to take that action isn't sufficient; you must actually take it before you can take the bonus action. During your turn, you do get to decide when to take the bonus action after you've taken the Attack action.": "{@feat Shield Master} 特技所提供的额外行动有一个前提条件：你在你的回合中采取{@action Attack}的行动。仅仅打算采取该行动是不够的，你必须在采取奖励行动之前实际采取该行动。在你的回合中，你确实可以决定在你采取攻击行动后何时采取奖励行动。",
	"This sort of if-then setup appears in many of the game's rules. The \"if\" must be satisfied before the \"then\" comes into play.": "这种 \"如果-然后 \"的设置出现在许多游戏规则中。在 \"然后 \"发挥作用之前，\"如果 \"必须得到满足。",
	"The intent is no. The {@feat Tough} feat affects a druid's hit points, which are replaced by the beast's hit points while using Wild Shape.": "意图是否定的。{@feat Tough}的特技会影响德鲁伊的命中率，在使用野性塑形时，这些命中率会被野兽的命中率所取代。",
	"They aren't. It's easy to mistake the three rolls as three faces of the same thing, because they each involve rolling a {@dice d20}, adding any modifiers, and comparing the total to a {@book Difficulty Class|PHB|7|Ability Checks}, and they're all subject to advantage and disadvantage. In short, they share the same procedure for determining success or failure.": "它们并不是。我们很容易误认为这三种掷法是同一件事的三个方面，因为它们都涉及到掷一个{@dice d20}，加上任何修饰物，然后将总数与一个{@book Difficulty Class|PHB|7|Ability Checks}相比较，而且它们都受到优势和劣势的影响。简而言之，它们有相同的程序来决定成功或失败。",
	"Despite this common procedure, the three rolls are separate from each other. If something in the game, like the {@spell guidance} spell, affects one of them, the other two aren't affected unless the rules specifically say so. The next few questions touch on this point again.": "尽管有这种常见的程序，但这三个卷轴是相互独立的。如果游戏中的某些东西，比如{@spell guidance}的咒语，影响了其中一个，其他两个就不会受到影响，除非规则中特别说明。接下来的几个问题再次触及这一点。",
	"Ability checks don't score critical hits. Attack rolls do.": "能力检查并不能获得关键命中。攻击卷可以。",
	"Rolling a 1 on an ability check or a saving throw is not an automatic failure. A 1 is an automatic miss for an attack roll.": "在能力检查或蓄力投掷中掷出1并不意味着自动失败。1是攻击卷的自动失败。",
	"No, the {@spell hex} spell's description says it affects ability checks that use the chosen ability. The description says nothing about affecting attack rolls or saving throws. This means, for example, that if you choose Constitution, the spell's target doesn't suffer disadvantage when trying to maintain {@book concentration|PHB|10|Concentration} on a spell, since concentration requires a Constitution saving throw, not a Constitution check.": "不，{@spell hex}法术的描述说它会影响使用所选能力的能力检查。描述中没有提到影响攻击卷或蓄力的问题。例如，这意味着如果你选择了体质，那么当你试图在一个法术上保持（%1%）时，该法术的目标不会受到不利影响，因为专注需要体质救赎，而不是体质检查。",
	"Curious about the spell's intent? The spell is meant to be a classic jinx—the sort seen in folklore—that is useful in and out of combat. In combat, the spell provides some extra necrotic damage. Outside combat, you could foil a cunning diplomat, for example, by casting the spell and imposing disadvantage on his or her Charisma checks.": "对该咒语的意图感到好奇？这个咒语是一个经典的扫把星--在民间传说中看到的那种--在战斗中和战斗外都很有用。在战斗中，该咒语提供一些额外的坏死伤害。在战斗之外，你可以挫败一个狡猾的外交官，比如说，通过施展这个咒语并对他或她的魅力检查施加不利因素。",
	"No. The feature benefits only ability checks. Don't forget that initiative rolls are Dexterity checks, so Jack of All Trades can benefit a bard's initiative, assuming the bard isn't already adding his or her proficiency bonus to it.": "不，该功能只对能力检查有利。不要忘了，主动性卷轴是灵巧检查，所以 \"万事通 \"可以使吟游诗人的主动性受益，前提是吟游诗人还没有把他或她的熟练度奖励加进去。",
	"No. That check is an ability check, so game effects tied to attack rolls don't apply to it. Going back to an earlier question, the {@spell hex} spell could be used to diminish a grappler's effectiveness. And if the grappler's target is under the effect of the {@action Dodge} action, that action doesn't inhibit the {@book grapple|PHB|9|Grappling}, since Dodge doesn't affect ability checks.": "不，那个检查是一个能力检查，所以与攻击卷相联系的游戏效果不适用于它。回到先前的问题，{@spell hex}咒语可以用来削弱抓捕者的效力。如果抓捕者的目标处于{@action Dodge}行动的影响下，该行动不会抑制{@book grapple|PHB|9|Grappling}，因为闪避不会影响能力检查。",
	"The only hard limit on the number of {@book short rests|PHB|8|Short Rest} you can take is the number of hours in a day. In practice, you're also limited by time pressures in the story and foes interrupting.": "你可以服用的（%0%）数量的唯一硬性限制是一天中的时间数。在实践中，你还会受到故事中的时间压力和敌人干扰的限制。",
	"An extradimensional space (aka an extraplanar space) is outside other planes. Therefore, if you're on the Material Plane and your foe is in an extradimensional space, the two of you aren't on the same plane of existence.": "一个超维空间（又称平面外空间）是在其他平面之外。因此，如果你在物质位面，而你的敌人在一个超维空间，你们两个人就不在同一个存在位面。",

	"No. If you can't see something, it's not within your line of sight. Speaking of \"line of sight,\" the game uses the English meaning of the term, which has no special meaning in the rules.": "如果你看不到某个东西，它就不在你的视线范围内。说到 \"视线\"，游戏中使用的是这个术语的英文含义，在规则中没有特殊含义。",
	"Yes. Spellcasting is more strenuous than the activities listed on page 186 of the Player's Handbook: \"eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.\"": "是的，施法比《玩家手册》第186页所列的活动更费力气。\"吃、喝、阅读和处理伤口\"。",
	"No, here's how surprise works.": "不，这里是惊喜的作用。",
	"The first step of any combat is this: the DM determines whether anyone in the combat is surprised (reread \"{@book Combat Step by Step|PHB|9|Combat Step by Step}\" in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}). This determination happens only once during a fight and only at the beginning. In other words, once a fight starts, you can't be surprised again, although a hidden foe can still gain the normal benefits from being unseen (see \"{@book Unseen Attackers and Targets|PHB|9|Unseen Attackers and Targets}\" in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}).": "任何战斗的第一步都是这样的：DM决定战斗中是否有人受到惊吓（重读（%1%）中的\"（%0%）\"）。这种判断在一场战斗中只发生一次，而且只在开始时发生。换句话说，一旦战斗开始，你就不能再被惊动了，尽管一个隐藏的敌人仍然可以从不被发现中获得正常的好处（见{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的\"{@book Unseen Attackers and Targets|PHB|9|Unseen Attackers and Targets}\"）。",
	"To be surprised, you must be caught off guard, usually because you failed to notice foes being stealthy or you were startled by an enemy with a special ability, such as the {@creature Gelatinous Cube||gelatinous cube's} Transparent trait, that makes it exceptionally surprising. You can be surprised even if your companions aren't, and you aren't surprised if even one of your foes fails to catch you unawares.": "要出其不意，你必须猝不及防，通常是因为你没有注意到敌人的隐身，或者你被一个具有特殊能力的敌人吓了一跳，比如{@creature Gelatinous Cube||gelatinous cube's}透明特性，使其异常惊讶。即使你的同伴不惊讶，你也能感到惊讶，即使你的一个敌人未能让你措手不及，你也不会感到惊讶。",
	"If anyone is surprised, no actions are taken yet. First, initiative is rolled as normal. Then, the first round of combat starts, and the unsurprised combatants act in initiative order. A surprised creature can't move or take an action or a {@book reaction|PHB|9|Reactions} until its first turn ends (remember that being unable to take an action also means you can't take a bonus action). In effect, a surprised creature skips its first turn in a fight. Once that turn ends, the creature is no longer surprised.": "如果有人感到惊讶，还没有采取任何行动。首先，主动权如常被掷出。然后，第一轮战斗开始，未受惊吓的战斗人员按主动权顺序行动。一个被惊动的生物在其第一轮结束之前，不能移动或采取行动或（%0%）（记住，不能采取行动也意味着你不能采取奖励行动）。实际上，一个被惊动的生物在战斗中跳过了它的第一个回合。一旦该回合结束，该生物就不再被惊奇。",
	"In short, activity in a combat is always ordered by initiative, whether or not someone is surprised, and after the first round of combat has passed, surprise is no longer a factor. You can still try to hide from your foes and gain the benefits conferred by being hidden, but you don't deprive your foes of their turns when you do so.": "简而言之，战斗中的活动总是由主动权决定的，无论某人是否感到惊讶，而在第一轮战斗结束后，惊讶不再是一个因素。你仍然可以试图躲避你的敌人，并获得被隐藏所赋予的好处，但你这样做时并不剥夺你的敌人的回合。",
	"The surprise rule is relevant only when a combat is starting. Any ambushes during the fight use the rules for Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks.": "奇袭规则只在战斗开始时才有意义。战斗中的任何伏击都使用灵巧（（%0%））检查的规则。",
	"Being surprised has no effect on saves. If you're surprised, you can't move or take an action on your first turn of the combat and you can't take a {@book reaction|PHB|9|Reactions} until that turn ends.": "被惊讶对救赎没有影响。如果你被惊吓，你在战斗的第一个回合不能移动或采取行动，并且在该回合结束前不能采取（%0%）。",
	"No. When it's your turn, either you do something or you don't. If you don't want to do anything, consider taking the {@action Dodge} action so that you'll, at least, have some extra protection. If you want to wait to act in response to something, take the {@action Ready} action, which lets you take part of your turn later.": "不，当轮到你时，你要么做什么，要么不做。如果你不想做任何事，可以考虑采取{@action Dodge}行动，这样你至少会有一些额外的保护。如果你想等着对某件事情做出反应，就采取{@action Ready}行动，这可以让你在以后的回合中采取部分行动。",
	"For a variety of reasons, we didn't include the option to delay your turn:": "由于各种原因，我们没有包括延迟转身的选项。",
	"Your turn involves several decisions, including where to move and what action to take. If you could delay your turn, your decision-making would possibly become slower, since you would have to consider whether you wanted to take your turn at all. Multiply that extra analysis by the number of characters and monsters in a combat, and you have the potential for many slowdowns in play.": "你的回合涉及几个决定，包括在哪里移动和采取什么行动。如果你能推迟你的回合，你的决策可能会变得更慢，因为你将不得不考虑你是否要采取你的回合。将这种额外的分析乘以战斗中的角色和怪物的数量，你就有可能在游戏中出现许多迟缓的情况。",
	"The ability to delay your turn can make initiative meaningless, as characters and monsters bounce around in the initiative order. If combatants can change their place in the initiative order at will, why use initiative at all? On top of that, changing initiative can easily turn into an unwelcome chore, especially for the DM, who might have to change the initiative list over and over during a fight.": "延迟回合的能力会使主动权变得毫无意义，因为角色和怪物在主动权的顺序中跳来跳去。如果战斗人员可以随意改变他们在主动权顺序中的位置，那么为什么还要使用主动权？此外，改变主动权很容易变成一个不受欢迎的苦差事，特别是对管理员来说，他可能不得不在战斗中一次又一次地改变主动权列表。",
	"Being able to delay your turn can let you wreak havoc on the durations of spells and other effects, particularly any of them that last until your next turn. Simply by changing when your turn happens, you could change the length of certain spells. The way to guard against such abuse would be to create a set of additional rules that would limit your ability to change durations. The net effect? More complexity would be added to the game, and with more complexity, there is greater potential for slower play.": "能够推迟你的回合可以让你对法术和其他效果的持续时间进行破坏，特别是任何持续到你下一回合的效果。仅仅通过改变你的回合发生时间，你就可以改变某些法术的长度。防止这种滥用的方法是建立一套额外的规则，以限制你改变持续时间的能力。净效果是什么？更多的复杂性将被添加到游戏中，而随着更多的复杂性，有更大的可能性会出现更慢的游戏。",
	"Two of our goals for combat were for it to be speedy and for initiative to matter. We didn't want to start every combat by rolling initiative and then undermine turn order with a delay option. Moreover, we felt that toying with initiative wasn't where the focus should be in battle. Instead, the dramatic actions of the combatants should be the focus, with turns that happen as quickly as possible.": "我们对战斗的两个目标是使其快速和主动性重要。我们不希望每次战斗都以滚动主动权开始，然后用延迟选项破坏回合秩序。此外，我们觉得玩弄主动权并不是战斗中的重点所在。相反，战斗人员的戏剧性行动应该是重点，回合应该尽可能快地发生。",
	"If you have an action readied, you can make an opportunity attack, which causes you to stop readying.": "如果你有一个行动准备好了，你可以进行一次机会攻击，这使你停止准备。",
	"No. Actions and bonus actions aren't interchangeable. In the example, the bard could use Bardic Inspiration or {@spell healing word} on a turn, not both.": "不，行动和奖励行动是不能互换的。在这个例子中，吟游诗人可以在一个回合中使用吟游诗人的灵感或（%0%），而不是同时使用。",

	"The {@condition prone} condition doesn't override the rule that prevents you from moving through an enemy's space, unless that enemy is at least two sizes larger or two sizes smaller than you.": "{@condition prone}的条件并不推翻阻止你在敌人的空间中移动的规则，除非那个敌人至少比你大两号或小两号。",

	"What about unusual cases like the {@spell green-flame blade|TCE} spell? The spell, which appears in the {@book Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|SCAG}, tells you to make a melee attack with a weapon. Look at the table above, and you see that, under normal circumstances, you use your Strength modifier when you make a melee weapon attack. It doesn't matter that a spell told you to attack. If a spell expects you to make a spell attack, the spell's description says so. For examples, take a look at {@spell fire bolt} and {@spell ray of frost}. Both say it—\"spell attack.\"": "像{@spell green-flame blade|TCE}的咒语这种不寻常的情况怎么办？这个出现在（%1%）的咒语，告诉你用武器进行近战攻击。看看上面的表格，你会发现，在正常情况下，当你进行近战武器攻击时，你会使用你的力量修改器。一个法术告诉你要攻击并不重要。如果一个法术希望你进行法术攻击，那么法术的描述就会这样说。举例来说，看看（%2%）和（%3%）。两者都说了--\"法术攻击\"。",
	"It means a melee attack with a weapon. Similarly, \"ranged weapon attack\" means a ranged attack with a weapon. Some attacks count as a melee or ranged weapon attack even if a weapon isn't involved, as specified in the text of those attacks. For example, an unarmed strike counts as a melee weapon attack, even though the attacker's body isn't considered a weapon.": "它是指用武器进行的近战攻击。同样，\"远程武器攻击 \"是指使用武器的远程攻击。有些攻击算作近战或远程武器攻击，即使不涉及武器，正如这些攻击的文本所规定的那样。例如，徒手攻击算作近战武器攻击，尽管攻击者的身体不被视为武器。",

For example, if you're wielding a {@item halberd|PHB}, a creature that is right next to you could move 5 feet away without triggering an opportunity attack.

Go look for it in the room at the top of the next tower.\" You failed your saving throw, and off you went to the other tower, thinking it was your idea to go there. You and your companions might deduce that you were beguiled if evidence of the spell is found. It's ultimately up to the DM whether you discover the presence of inconspicuous spells. Discovery usually comes through the use of skills like {@skill Arcana}, {@skill Investigation}, {@skill Insight}, and {@skill Perception} or through spells like {@spell detect magic}.": "有些法术是如此微妙，以至于你可能不知道你曾经受到过它们的影响。这种法术的一个典型例子是（%0%）。假设你没有注意到施法者的施法，你可能只记得施法者说：\"你要找的宝藏不在这里。去下一个塔顶的房间里找吧。\" 你的救赎失败了，然后你就去了另一座塔，以为是你的主意。如果找到了咒语的证据，你和你的同伴可能会推断出你被诱骗了。你是否发现不显眼的法术的存在，最终取决于DM。发现通常是通过使用技能，如（1%）、（2%）、（3%）和（4%），或通过法术，如（5%）。",

That casting of {@spell hold monster} is, therefore, 5th level, which is the lowest possible level for that spell.": "术士的卡塞里之链（Chains of Carceri）功能允许术士在不使用法术槽的情况下施放（%0%）。因此，{@spell hold monster}的施放是5级的，这是该法术的最低等级。",

	"You sure can! Here's a common way for it to happen: Cornelius the wizard is casting {@spell fireball} on his turn, and his foe casts {@spell counterspell} on him.

If the spell, such as {@spell aid}, also has a somatic component, she can perform that component with the shield hand and keep holding the mace in the other.": "另一个例子：一个牧师的（%0%）被印在她的（%1%）上。她喜欢一手拿着（%2%），一手拿着盾牌，涉足近战。她用神圣的标志作为她的法术重点，所以当她施展有物质成分的牧师法术时，她需要手握盾牌。如果该法术，例如{@spell aid}，也有体质成分，她可以用盾牌的手执行该成分，另一只手继续拿着长矛。",
	"If the same cleric casts {@spell cure wounds}, she needs to put the {@item mace|PHB} or the {@item shield|PHB} away, because that spell doesn't have a material component but does have a somatic component.

If she had the {@feat War Caster} feat, she could ignore this restriction.": "如果同一个教士施展（%0%），她需要把（%1%）或（%2%）收起来，因为这个咒语没有物质成分，但有体质成分。她需要一只自由的手来做这个咒语的手势。如果她有{@feat War Caster}的特技，她可以忽略这个限制。",

	"Keep in mind that temporary hit points aren't cumulative. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you don't add them together, unless a game feature says you can. You decide which temporary hit points to keep.

You currently have 2 temporary hit points remaining from {@spell Armor of Agathys||armor of Agathys}, you just slew a monster, and your Dark One's Blessing can now give you 4 temporary hit points. If you take those temporary hit points, they replace the ones from {@spell armor of Agathys} and end that spell, so you might not want to take them and keep the spell going instead, so as to continue benefiting from the cold damage it delivers.": "请记住，临时命中率是不能累积的。如果你有临时命中率并得到了更多的命中率，你不能把它们加在一起，除非有游戏特征说你可以。你要决定保留哪些临时打击点数。举个例子，假设你是一个拥有 \"黑暗者的祝福 \"特性的术士，当你将一个生物的命中率降至0时，该特性会给你临时命中点。你目前有2个临时命中率（%0%），你刚刚杀死了一个怪物，而你的黑暗者的祝福现在可以给你4个临时命中率。如果你接受这些临时命中率，它们会取代{@spell armor of Agathys}的命中率，并结束该咒语，所以你可能不想接受它们，而是继续保持该咒语，以便继续受益于它带来的寒冷伤害。",
	"{@spell Barkskin} specifies that your AC can't be lower than 16 while you are affected by the spell.

	"{@spell Dispel magic} has a particular purpose: to break other spells. It has no effect on a vampire's Charm ability or any other magical effect that isn't a spell. It also does nothing to the properties of a magic item. It can, however, end a spell cast from a magic item or from another source. Spells—they're what {@spell dispel magic} is about. For example, if you cast {@spell dispel magic} on a {@item staff of power}, the spell fails to disrupt the staff's magical properties, but if the staff's wielder casts {@spell hold monster} from the staff, {@spell dispel magic} can end that spell if cast on the target of {@spell hold monster}.": "{@spell Dispel magic}有一个特殊的目的：破解其他法术。它对吸血鬼的魅惑能力或任何其他不是咒语的魔法效果没有影响。它对魔法物品的属性也没有任何作用。然而，它可以结束一个从魔法物品或其他来源施放的咒语。法术--它们是{@spell dispel magic}的内容。例如，如果你在一个{@spell dispel magic}的法杖上施放{@item staff of power}，这个法术不能破坏法杖的魔法属性，但是如果法杖的持有者从法杖上施放{@spell hold monster}，如果对{@spell hold monster}的目标施放，{@spell dispel magic}可以结束这个法术。",
	"There are abilities and other spells that can end or suspend magical effects that aren't spells. For example, the {@spell greater restoration} spell can end a charm effect of any sort on a target (such as a {@creature Vampire||vampire's} Charm or a {@creature Dryad||dryad's} Fey Charm), and a paladin's Aura of Devotion can prevent or suspend such an effect.": "有一些能力和其他法术可以结束或暂停不是法术的魔法效果。例如，{@spell greater restoration}法术可以结束对目标的任何种类的魅惑效果（如{@creature Vampire||vampire's}魅惑或{@creature Dryad||dryad's}魅惑），而圣骑士的奉献光环可以阻止或暂停这种效果。",
	"Three of the most versatile spells for ending certain magical effects are {@spell lesser restoration}, {@spell greater restoration}, and {@spell remove curse}.": "三个最通用的结束某些魔法效果的法术是（%0%）、（%1%）和（%2%）。",
	"Whenever you wonder whether a spell's effects can be dispelled or suspended, you need to answer one question: is the spell's duration instantaneous? If the answer is yes, there is nothing to dispel or suspend. Here's why: the effects of an {@book instantaneous spell|PHB|10|Instantaneous} are brought into being by magic, but the effects aren't sustained by magic. The magic flares for a split second and then vanishes. For example, the instantaneous spell {@spell animate dead} harnesses magical energy to turn a corpse or a pile of bones into an undead creature. That necromantic magic is present for an instant and is then gone. The resulting undead now exists without the magic's help. Casting {@spell dispel magic} on the creature can't end its mockery of life, and the undead can wander into an {@spell antimagic field} with no adverse effect.": "每当你想知道一个法术的效果是否可以被驱散或中止时，你需要回答一个问题：这个法术的持续时间是瞬时的吗？如果答案是肯定的，就没有什么可以驱除或中止的。这就是原因：一个（%0%）的效果是由魔法带来的，但效果并不是由魔法维持的。魔力在一瞬间爆发，然后就消失了。例如，瞬发咒语（%1%）利用魔法能量将一具尸体或一堆骨头变成不死生物。这种亡灵魔法只存在一瞬间，然后就消失了。产生的亡灵现在没有魔法的帮助而存在。对该生物施放{@spell dispel magic}不能结束它对生命的嘲弄，而且该亡灵可以游荡到{@spell antimagic field}的地方，没有任何不良影响。",
	"Another example: {@spell cure wounds} instantaneously restores hit points to a creature. Because the spell's duration is instantaneous, the restoration can't be later dispelled. And you don't suddenly lose hit points if you step into an {@spell antimagic field} !": "另一个例子。{@spell cure wounds} 瞬间恢复一个生物的命中率。因为该法术的持续时间是瞬时的，所以该恢复不能在之后被驱散。而且，如果你踏入一个{@spell antimagic field}！你也不会突然失去命中率。",
	"In contrast, a spell like {@spell conjure woodland beings} has a non-instantaneous duration, which means its creations can be ended by {@spell dispel magic} and they temporarily disappear within an {@spell antimagic field}.": "相比之下，像{@spell conjure woodland beings}这样的法术有一个非瞬时的持续时间，这意味着它的创造可以被{@spell dispel magic}结束，它们在{@spell antimagic field}内暂时消失。",
	"The easiest way to stop a spell is to cast {@spell counterspell} on its caster while it's being cast. If successful, {@spell counterspell} interrupts the other spell's casting, and that spell fails to take effect. {@spell Counterspell} works against any spell, regardless of a spell's casting time or duration.": "阻止一个法术的最简单的方法是在它被施放的时候对它的施法者施放（%0%）。如果成功，{@spell counterspell}会打断另一个法术的施放，并且该法术无法生效。{@spell Counterspell}对任何法术都有效，不管法术的施法时间或持续时间。",
	"With the {@action Ready} action, dispel magic can be cast in response to another spell being cast, yet {@spell dispel magic} can't substitute for {@spell counterspell}. The main reason is that {@spell dispel magic} removes a spell that is already on a target, whether that target is a creature, an object, or some other phenomenon. {@spell Dispel magic} can't dispel something in advance. If a spell isn't already present on a target, {@spell dispel magic} does nothing to that target. The best that a readied {@spell dispel magic} can do is dispel a spell immediately after the spell has been cast to prevent it from having any effect after the action used to cast it. For example, on your turn you could say something like this: \"I ready {@spell dispel magic}, and if the high priest casts a spell on anyone, I cast {@spell dispel magic} on the target if the spell takes hold.\" If the high priest then cast {@spell hold person} on your companion who fails the save against it, you could unleash your readied {@spell dispel magic} and end {@spell hold person}.": "通过{@action Ready}动作，驱散魔法可以对另一个正在施放的法术做出反应，然而{@spell dispel magic}不能代替{@spell counterspell}。主要原因是，{@spell dispel magic}会移除已经在目标上的咒语，无论目标是生物、物体还是其他现象。{@spell Dispel magic}不能提前驱除一些东西。如果目标上还没有咒语，（%5%）对该目标没有任何作用。已准备好的{@spell dispel magic}能做的最好的事是在施法后立即驱散一个咒语，以防止它在施法的行动后产生任何影响。例如，在你的回合，你可以这样说。\"我准备好了（%7%），如果大祭司对任何人施法，我对目标施法（%8%），如果该法术生效。\" 如果大祭司对你的同伴施放（%9%），而你的同伴对它的拯救失败，你可以释放你准备好的（%10%）并结束（%11%）。",
	"Yes, {@spell dispel magic} can dispel the barrier created by {@spell globe of invulnerability}, but not any magical effects that are active inside the barrier.": "是的，{@spell dispel magic}可以驱除{@spell globe of invulnerability}所创造的屏障，但不能驱除任何在屏障内活动的魔法效果。",
	"{@spell Dispel magic} ends a spell on one target. It doesn't end the same spell on other targets.": "{@spell Dispel magic}结束一个目标的法术。它不会对其他目标结束相同的法术。",
	"A {@spell Find Familiar||familiar} can't attack, but it can take non-attack actions, including {@action Help}. As the text of the {@action Help} action indicates, the action doesn't require you to be able to attack; you simply need to be able to provide some sort of distraction.": "一个（%0%）不能攻击，但它可以采取非攻击行动，包括（%1%）。正如{@action Help}行动的文字所示，该行动并不要求你能够攻击，你只需要能够提供某种分心。",
	"A {@spell Find Familiar||familiar} is an allied creature. Its proximity to a target can allow you to use the Sneak Attack feature or any other feature that requires the presence of an ally.": "一个{@spell Find Familiar||familiar}是一个盟友生物。它接近目标可以让你使用偷袭功能或任何其他需要盟友在场的功能。",
	"No, the intent of find familiar is that any objects are left behind when the familiar vanishes. This intent will be reflected in future printings of the Player's Handbook.": "不，寻找熟悉物的意图是，当熟悉物消失时，任何物体都会被留下。这一意图将反映在未来出版的《玩家手册》中。",
	"The fire of the {@spell fireball} spell can spread around corners, but it's limited by the spell's 20-foot radius. It doesn't extend farther than 20 feet from the point of origin no matter where it is cast.": "{@spell fireball}法术的火焰可以在角落里蔓延，但它受到法术的20英尺半径的限制。无论在哪里施法，它都不会从起源点延伸到20英尺以外的地方。",
	"Yes. The Disciple of Life feature would make each berry restore 4 hit points, instead of 1, assuming you cast {@spell goodberry} with a 1st-level spell slot.": "是的，\"生命的门徒 \"特征会使每颗浆果恢复4点生命值，而不是1点，假设你用1级法术槽施放（%0%）。",
	"Introduced in the {@book Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|SCAG}, the {@spell green-flame blade|TCE} and {@spell booming blade|TCE} spells pose a number of questions, because they each do something unusual: require you to make a melee attack with a weapon as part of the spell's casting.": "在{@book Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide|SCAG}中引入的{@spell green-flame blade|TCE}和{@spell booming blade|TCE}法术提出了一些问题，因为它们都做了一些不寻常的事情：要求你用武器进行近战攻击，作为施法的一部分。",
	"First, each of these spells involves a normal melee weapon attack, not a spell attack, so you use whatever ability modifier you normally use with the weapon. (A spell tells you if it includes a spell attack, and neither of these spells do.) For example, if you use a {@item longsword|PHB} with {@spell green-flame blade|TCE}, you use your Strength modifier for the weapon's attack and damage rolls.": "首先，这些法术中的每一个都涉及到普通的近战武器攻击，而不是法术攻击，所以你使用你通常对武器使用的任何能力修改器。(一个法术会告诉你它是否包括法术攻击，而这些法术都没有）。例如，如果你用{@item longsword|PHB}和{@spell green-flame blade|TCE}，你用你的力量修正器来进行武器的攻击和伤害卷。",
	"Second, neither {@spell green-flame blade|TCE} nor {@spell booming blade|TCE} works with Extra Attack or any other feature that requires the {@action Attack} action. Like other spells, these cantrips require the {@action Cast a Spell} action, not the Attack action, and they can't be used to make an opportunity attack, unless a special feature allows you to do so.": "其次，{@spell green-flame blade|TCE}和{@spell booming blade|TCE}都不能与额外攻击或任何其他需要{@action Attack}动作的功能一起使用。和其他法术一样，这些咒语需要{@action Cast a Spell}动作，而不是攻击动作，而且它们不能被用来进行机会攻击，除非有特殊功能允许你这样做。",
	"Third, these weapon attacks work with Sneak Attack if they fulfill the normal requirements for that feature. For example, if you have the Sneak Attack feature and cast {@spell green-flame blade|TCE} with a finesse weapon, you can deal Sneak Attack damage to the target of the weapon attack if you have advantage on the attack roll and hit.": "第三，如果这些武器攻击满足了偷袭的正常要求，它们就可以与偷袭一起使用。例如，如果你有偷袭功能，并使用精巧的武器施放（%0%），如果你在攻击卷上有优势并命中，你可以对武器攻击的目标造成偷袭伤害。",
	"Is it 20 because that's how much it dealt or 10 because that's how much the target took? It dealt 10 damage to the creature, so 10 is subtracted from the total.": "是20，因为它造成了多少伤害，还是10，因为目标承受了多少伤害？它对生物造成的伤害是10，所以从总数中减去了10。",
	"{@spell Hail of thorns} lasts until you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack or your {@book concentration|PHB|10|Concentration} ends, whichever comes first.": "{@spell Hail of thorns}持续到你用远程武器攻击击中一个生物或你的{@book concentration|PHB|10|Concentration}结束，以先到者为准。",

	"Temporary hit points aren't cumulative. The spell would tell you if you were meant to add together the temporary hit points it provides. At the start of each of your turns, the spell, effectively, refreshes the number of temporary hit points you have from it; if you lost some or all of the temporary hit points, the spell gives them back to you.": "临时命中率是不能累积的。咒语会告诉你，如果你是要把它提供的临时命中率加在一起的话。在你每个回合开始时，该咒语，有效地，从它那里刷新了你的临时命中点数；如果你失去了部分或全部临时命中点数，该咒语会把它们还给你。",
	"The {@spell heroism} spell would suppress a frightening effect that was already on its target. When the spell ends, the target's immunity goes away and the frightening effect resumes if it has not expired or been removed.": "{@spell heroism}的法术会抑制已经在目标身上的惊吓效果。当咒语结束时，目标的免疫力会消失，如果惊吓效果没有过期或被移除，则会重新开始。",
	"The extra damage in the {@spell hex} spell requires an attack that hits.": "{@spell hex}的法术中的额外伤害需要有一次击中的攻击。",
	"The most important factors are time and convenience. During a short rest, which takes at least 1 hour, a character who meets the qualifications can determine the properties of one magic item (see \"{@book Identifying a Magic Item|DMG|7|Identifying a Magic Item}\" in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}).

If your speed is 30 feet, you can use only 30 feet of that jump distance on your turn, unless you take the {@action Dash} action, which allows you to leap the full 45 feet.": "例如，如果你的力量得分是15分，当你进行远跳时，如果你在紧接之前移动了至少10英尺，你通常可以跃过15英尺。如果{@spell jump}的法术被施加在你身上，这个潜在的跳跃距离会增加三倍。这就是45英尺的跳跃! 如果你的速度是30英尺，你在你的回合中只能使用30英尺的跳跃距离，除非你采取{@action Dash}的行动，这样你可以跳满45英尺。",
	"{@spell Mage armor} works with a {@item shield|PHB}. Shields are grouped with armor in the equipment rules in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, but various game features distinguish between the armor you wear and a shield you wield.

In the monk's version, you must both forgo wearing armor and forgo wielding a shield if you want to benefit from the feature, whereas a barbarian must only forgo wearing armor.": "{@spell Mage armor}与{@item shield|PHB}一起工作。盾牌在装备规则中与盔甲归为{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}，但各种游戏特性区分了你穿的盔甲和你挥舞的盾牌。看看僧侣的无甲防御功能，并将其与野蛮人的版本进行比较。在僧侣的版本中，如果你想从该功能中获益，你必须同时放弃穿戴盔甲和放弃挥舞盾牌，而野蛮人则必须只放弃穿戴盔甲。",
	"Unarmored Defense doesn't work with {@spell mage armor}. You might be asking yourself, \"Why don't they work together? {@spell Mage armor} specifies that it works on a creature who isn't wearing armor.\" It's true that the target of {@spell mage armor} must be unarmored, but {@spell mage armor} gives you a new way to calculate your AC (13 + your Dexterity modifier) and is therefore incompatible with Unarmored Defense or any other feature that provides an AC calculation.": "无装甲防御不与（%0%）合作。你可能会问自己，\"为什么它们不能一起使用？{@spell Mage armor}规定它对没有穿戴盔甲的生物有效\"。的确，{@spell mage armor}的目标必须是无甲的，但{@spell mage armor}给了你一个新的方法来计算你的攻击力（13+你的灵巧修饰），因此与无甲防御或任何其他提供攻击力计算的特性不兼容。",
	"Some spells and class features have figurative, not literal, names. The text of the spell or class feature explains what it does. In this case, {@spell mage armor} surrounds the target with \"protective magical force\"; the spell doesn't provide armor.": "有些法术和类特性的名称是比喻性的，而不是字面的。咒语或类特性的文字解释了它的作用。在这个例子中，{@spell mage armor}用 \"保护性的魔法力量 \"包围目标；该法术不提供护甲。",

	"Some teleportation effects do specify that you teleport with your gear; such specification is an example of a rule being needlessly fastidious, since no teleportation effect in the game assumes that you teleport without your clothes, just as the general movement rules don't assume that you drop everything when you walk.": "有些传送效果确实规定你要带着装备传送；这种规定是一个规则不必要地急功近利的例子，因为游戏中没有任何传送效果是假定你不穿衣服就传送的，就像一般的移动规则不假定你走路时放下所有东西一样。",
	"The answer to both questions is no. Here's some elaboration on that answer.": "这两个问题的答案都是否定的。下面是对这个答案的一些阐述。",
	"Some spells and other game features create an area of effect that does something when a creature enters that area for the first time on a turn or when a creature starts its turn in that area. On the turn when you cast such a spell, you're primarily setting up hurt for your foes on later turns. {@spell Moonbeam}, for example, creates a beam of light that can damage a creature who enters the beam or who starts its turn in the beam.": "有些法术和其他游戏功能创造了一个效应区域，当一个生物在某一回合第一次进入该区域时，或当一个生物在该区域开始其回合时，该效应区域就会发生作用。在你施放这种法术的那一回合，你主要是为你的敌人在以后的回合中设置伤害。例如，{@spell Moonbeam}创造了一道光束，可以伤害进入该光束的生物或在该光束中开始其回合的生物。",
	"Here are some spells with the same timing as {@spell moonbeam} for their areas of effect:": "下面是一些法术，其作用区域的时间与（%0%）相同。",
	"Reading the description of any of those spells, you might wonder whether a creature is considered to be entering the spell's area of effect if the area is created on the creature's space. And if the area of effect can be moved—as the beam of {@spell moonbeam} can—does moving it into a creature's space count as the creature entering the area? Our design intent for such spells is this: a creature enters the area of effect when the creature passes into it. Creating the area of effect on the creature or moving it onto the creature doesn't count. If the creature is still in the area at the start of its turn, it is subjected to the area's effect.": "在阅读这些法术的描述时，你可能会想，如果该区域是在生物的空间上建立的，那么生物是否会被视为进入法术的效果区域。如果效果区域可以被移动--就像{@spell moonbeam}的光束一样--那么将它移动到生物的空间中是否算作生物进入该区域？我们对这类法术的设计意图是这样的：当生物进入效果区域时，该生物就进入了该区域。在生物上创造效果区或将其移到生物上并不算数。如果该生物在其回合开始时仍在该区域内，它就会受到该区域的效果影响。",
