	"This is a pretty special installment of the Plane Shift series for me, because I was the creative lead for Ixalan world building. Perhaps betraying my fourteen-year history working on Dungeons & Dragons, Ixalan is a world of exploration and treasure, marked by ancient sites waiting to be explored by intrepid heroes. One of those sites, shown on a card in the Ixalan set, is obviously inspired by a classic D&D adventure, The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan. This plane lacks only dragons to be a fully realized D&D milieu—there's even a world map! Ultimately, that means that writing Plane Shift: Ixalan was both a ton of fun and relatively easy. The people who populate Ixalan have a lot in common with D&D characters already, and mapping them to existing classes and backgrounds was a pretty straightforward task. Similarly, the creatures of the plane—especially the dinosaurs—had a lot of analogues in the game already. And still, this is the longest installment of Plane Shift yet! That's partly because I had the freedom to really cut loose on ideas and inspiration to help you play a character in this exciting world. You'll find more tables in here than ever before—tables of personality traits and ideals to flesh out your character, of treasures to flavor your hoards, and inspiration to bring your party together. This sort of thing is both really enjoyable and really challenging to write—a lot like the flavor text on Magic cards, actually, because each one is a self-contained nugget, a complete idea in a single sentence. I hope that all this stuff enriches your game. The appendix in this document is an extended musing on the colors of Magic and their relationship to D&D characters and spells. This is the sort of thing that dominates a lot of lunchtime conversations with members of the Magic creative team who are also avid D&D fans, and also the sort of thing I get a lot of questions about on Twitter. As with much of the rest of this document, the focus is more on roleplaying and character building than on rules. It's a first stab, though, toward a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the worlds of both games. As always, The Art of Magic: The Gathering—Ixalan is the definitive resource for information about the plane. With this document, you can use that information to build a campaign with a minimum of changes to the fifth edition D&D rules, which you can find here. And even without the book, you can find lore about Ixalan on the Magic web site. There's a lot of open space on that map. I hope you have fun exploring the world of Ixalan!": "对我来说，这是一个相当特别的 \"位面转移 \"系列，因为我是伊克萨兰世界建设的创意负责人。也许是背叛了我在《龙与地下城》工作的14年历史，艾克萨兰是一个探索和宝藏的世界，有许多古老的遗址等待着无畏的英雄们去探索。其中一个地点，显示在艾克萨兰套装的卡片上，显然是受到D&D经典冒险的启发，塔莫阿坎的隐秘神殿。这个位面只需要龙就可以成为一个完整的D&D环境--甚至还有一个世界地图 归根结底，这意味着编写《星球转移》。伊萨兰》既充满乐趣，又相对容易。Ixalan的居民与D&D的角色有很多共同点，将他们与现有的类别和背景进行映射是一项非常简单的任务。同样地，飞机上的生物--尤其是恐龙--在游戏中已经有很多类似的东西了。尽管如此，这仍然是《飞机转移》中最长的一期！这部分是因为我有一个很好的机会，让我能够在游戏中找到类似的东西。部分原因是我可以自由地发挥创意和灵感，帮助你在这个令人兴奋的世界中扮演一个角色。你会发现这里有比以往更多的表格--用来充实你的角色的个性特征和理想的表格，用来充实你的囤积物的宝物表格，以及用来将你的队伍团结起来的灵感表格。这种东西写起来既有趣又有挑战性--实际上，这很像魔术卡上的风味文字，因为每张卡都是一个自成一体的小块，一个完整的想法在一句话里。我希望所有这些东西都能丰富你的游戏。本文件的附录是对魔法的颜色及其与D&D角色和法术的关系的延伸思考。这是在午餐时间与同时也是狂热的D&D粉丝的《魔法》创作团队成员的谈话中占主导地位的那种东西，也是我在Twitter上收到的很多问题的那种东西。就像本文件的大部分内容一样，重点在于角色扮演和角色塑造，而不是规则。但这是对这两个游戏的世界之间的关系的更全面的理解的第一次尝试。一如既往，《魔法：集会-艾克萨兰的艺术》是关于这个平面的权威信息资源。有了这份文件，你就可以利用这些信息来建立一个对第五版D&D规则进行最少改动的战役，你可以在这里找到这些规则。即使没有这本书，你也可以在魔法网站上找到关于伊萨兰的传说。那张地图上有很多开放的空间。我希望你在探索伊克萨兰世界的过程中能获得乐趣!",
	"The Sun Empire is a powerful civilization that dominates the eastern coast of Ixalan. The empire's fierce warriors are supported by priests who wield the power of the sun and command the mighty dinosaurs that inhabit the continent. A new ruler has brought the empire into an era of expansion, seeking to reclaim the lands in the continent's interior that it once held. At the same time, a foreign incursion into those same lands sparks a search for the artifact known as the Immortal Sun, which the people of the empire view as a potent symbol of their identity.": "太阳帝国是一个强大的文明，统治着伊萨兰的东海岸。帝国凶猛的战士们得到了祭司的支持，他们挥舞着太阳的力量，指挥着居住在大陆上的强大的恐龙。一位新的统治者将帝国带入了一个扩张的时代，试图夺回它曾经拥有的大陆内部的土地。与此同时，外国对这些土地的入侵引发了对被称为不朽太阳的文物的搜寻，帝国的人民将其视为他们身份的有力象征。",
	"Consider the following class options for your Sun Empire character.": "考虑为你的太阳帝国角色提供以下等级选择。",
	"Certain warriors devoted to Tilonalli (the destructive aspect of the Threefold Sun—the deity worshiped by the folk of the empire) enter a berserk rage in combat. The Path of the Berserker is appropriate for these characters, or the Path of the Totem Warrior (replacing bear, eagle, and wolf totem spirits with ceratops, aerosaur, and raptor spirits, respectively).": "某些献身于蒂罗纳利（Threefold Sun的破坏性方面--帝国人民崇拜的神灵）的战士在战斗中进入狂暴状态。狂暴者之路适合这些角色，或者图腾战士之路（分别用角龙、气龙和猛禽的精神取代熊、鹰和狼的图腾精神）。",
	"Poetry is a respected art among the warriors of the Sun Empire, so bards of the College of Valor might be found within their ranks.": "诗歌在太阳帝国的战士中是一种受人尊敬的艺术，所以在他们的队伍中可能会发现英勇学院的吟游诗人。",
	"Sun Empire clerics are typically devoted to one particular aspect of the Threefold Sun. Kinjalli, the Wakening Sun, represents the deity's creative aspects and grants access to the Life and Light domains. Ixalli, the Verdant Sun, represents its sustaining and nourishing aspects, granting access to the Life and {@skill Nature} domains. Tilonalli, the Burning Sun, represents its destructive aspects and grants access to the Tempest and War domains.": "太阳帝国的神职人员通常致力于三倍太阳的一个特定方面。唤醒的太阳金加利（Kinjalli）代表了神灵的创造性方面，并授予进入生命和光明领域的权限。Ixalli，青翠的太阳，代表其维持和滋养的方面，授予进入生命和（%0%）领域的权利。Tilonalli，燃烧的太阳，代表其破坏性的一面，授予进入暴风雨和战争领域的权限。",
	"Certain shamans of the Sun Empire are closely attuned to the forces of nature, and use wild shape to take on dinosaur forms. These druids typically follow the Circle of the Moon.": "太阳帝国的某些巫师与自然界的力量密切相关，并利用野生形状化身为恐龙形态。这些德鲁伊通常遵循 \"月之环\"。",
	"Highly trained soldiers and warriors are the backbone of the Sun Empire. They are typically Battle Masters or Champions.": "训练有素的士兵和战士是太阳帝国的骨干力量。他们通常是战斗大师或冠军。",
	"Knights of the Sun Empire are drawn to the Oath of the Ancients and (increasingly, as vampires and pirates mount incursions into their lands) the Oath of Vengeance. These paladins often use the {@spell find steed} spell to acquire dinosaur mounts (typically a hadrosaurus, described in Volo's Guide to Monsters).": "太阳帝国的骑士们被古人之誓和（随着吸血鬼和海盗入侵他们的土地，越来越多地）复仇之誓所吸引。这些圣骑士经常使用（%0%）法术来获得恐龙坐骑（通常是黑龙，在沃罗的怪物指南中有所描述）。",
	"Scouts of the Sun Empire are often rangers, including both Beast Masters and Hunters. The pteranodon, dimetrodon, and velociraptor are all appropriate ranger's companions.": "太阳帝国的侦察兵通常是游侠，包括野兽大师和猎人。翼龙、迪米特龙和迅猛龙都是合适的游骑兵的伙伴。",
	"The trickiest thing about playing D&D in a highly factionalized setting like Ixalan is bringing player characters together who belong to different groups and would have no obvious reason to want to cooperate—let alone trust each other with their lives. One possibility, of course, is for all the characters to belong to the same faction. An all-vampire party bent on conquest or an all-pirate party set to explore the Stormwreck Sea can find plenty of adventure in Ixalan. But if one player is intent on playing a merfolk and one is determined to be an orc, some extra effort is required to bring them together.": "在Ixalan这样一个高度派系化的环境中玩D&D，最棘手的事情是把属于不同团体的玩家角色聚集在一起，他们没有明显的理由想要合作--更不用说把生命交给对方了。当然，一种可能性是所有角色都属于同一派别。一个一心想要征服的全吸血鬼队伍或一个准备探索风暴残骸海的全海盗队伍可以在伊萨兰找到大量的冒险。但是，如果一个玩家打算扮演人鱼族，而另一个则决心成为兽人，那么就需要付出一些额外的努力来将他们聚在一起。",
	"The most straightforward approach is to put the characters into a situation where they need to work together to survive or to achieve some goal they all share. Necessity makes strange bedfellows, as the saying goes, and characters who find themselves in a bad situation have a strong incentive to put aside their differences and work together, at least until they get out of that situation. They might all be trapped in the same place, or each character could have something that the whole group needs.": "最直接的方法是将人物置于需要合作生存或实现某些共同目标的情况下。俗话说 \"物以类聚，人以群分\"，发现自己处于不利境地的角色有强烈的动机去抛开他们的分歧，一起工作，至少在他们摆脱这种情况之前。他们可能都被困在同一个地方，或者每个角色都可能有整个团体需要的东西。",
	"You can roll on the following table to generate ideas for bringing characters together at the start of the campaign. Ideally, by the time they have overcome whatever circumstance has thrown them together, they will have learned to trust each other and perhaps even become friends.": "你可以在下面的表格中滚动，以产生在活动开始时将角色聚集在一起的想法。理想的情况是，当他们克服了将他们扔在一起的任何情况时，他们已经学会了相互信任，甚至可能成为朋友。",
	"The characters begin the campaign captured, whether as prisoners of the Legion of Dusk, captives in a pirate ship's brig, or trapped in jungle snares.": "活动开始时，角色们都被俘虏了，无论是黄昏军团的囚犯、海盗船上的俘虏，还是被困在丛林的陷阱里。",
	"The characters are fighting each other when a dinosaur attacks.": "角色们正在相互争斗，这时一只恐龙袭击了他们。",
	"The characters are trapped together by a cave-in, a sinkhole opening, or some similar disaster.": "角色们因塌陷、天坑开启或一些类似的灾难而被困在一起。",
	"Each character has one piece of a treasure map, or one key of several required to open a treasure vault.": "每个角色都有一张藏宝图，或者是打开宝库所需的几把钥匙中的一把。",
	"A strange dream leads each of the characters to the same destination.": "一个奇怪的梦将每个人物引向同一个目的地。",
	"The characters are all hopelessly lost in the jungle.": "这些人物都在丛林中无望地迷失了方向。",
	"Leaders of the characters' factions have ordered them to cooperate on a secret mission.": "人物所在派别的领导人命令他们合作完成一项秘密任务。",
	"A pirate captain or other villain is a common enemy to all the characters.": "海盗船长或其他恶棍是所有人物的共同敌人。",
	"A magical or natural phenomenon threatens all folk of Ixalan.": "一个神奇的或自然的现象威胁着伊萨兰的所有居民。",
	"The characters are all trying to avert the catastrophe of a fullscale war among their peoples.": "这些人物都在努力避免他们的民族之间发生全面战争的灾难。"
