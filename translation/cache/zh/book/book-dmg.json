	"It's good to be the dungeon master! Not only do you get to tell fantastic stories about heroes, villains, monsters, and magic, but you also get to create the world in which these stories live. Whether you're running a D&D game already or you think it's something you want to try, this book is for you.": "做地下城主是件好事！你不仅可以讲述关于英雄、恶棍和魔法的奇妙故事，而且还可以创造这些故事的世界。你不仅可以讲述关于英雄、恶棍、怪物和魔法的奇妙故事，而且还可以创造这些故事所处的世界。无论你是已经在经营D&D游戏，还是认为这是一个你想尝试的东西，这本书都是为你准备的。",
	"The {@i Dungeon Master's Guide} assumes that you know the basics of how to play the D&D tabletop roleplaying game. If you haven't played before, the Dungeons & Dragons Starter Set is a great starting point for new players and DMs.": "{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}假设你知道如何玩D&D桌面角色扮演游戏的基本知识。如果你以前没有玩过，《龙与地下城》入门套装是新玩家和DM的一个很好的起点。",
	"This book has two important companions: the Player's Handbook, which contains the rules your players need to create characters and the rules you need to run the game, and the Monster Manual, which contains ready-to use monsters to populate your D&D world.": "本书有两个重要的伙伴：《玩家手册》和《怪物手册》，前者包含玩家创建角色所需的规则和你运行游戏所需的规则，后者包含可随时使用的怪物以填充你的D&D世界。",
	"The Dungeon Master (DM) is the creative force behind a D&D game. The DM creates a world for the other players to explore, and also creates and runs adventures that drive the story. An adventure typically hinges on the successful completion of a quest, and can be as short as a single game session. Longer adventures might embroil players in great conflicts that require multiple game sessions to resolve. When strung together, these adventures form an ongoing {@b campaign.} A D&D campaign can include dozens of adventures and last for months or years.": "地牢管理员（DM）是D&D游戏背后的创造性力量。管理员为其他玩家创造了一个可以探索的世界，同时也创造和运行驱动故事的冒险。一个冒险通常取决于任务的成功完成，可以短至一个游戏会话。较长的冒险可能会使玩家陷入巨大的冲突，需要多个游戏会话来解决。当这些冒险串联在一起时，就形成了一个持续的（%0%）D&D活动可以包括几十个冒险，并持续数月或数年。",
	"A Dungeon Master gets to wear many hats. As the architect of a campaign, the DM creates adventures by placing monsters, traps, and treasures for the other players' characters (the {@b adventurers}) to discover. As a storyteller, the DM helps the other players visualize what's happening around them, improvising when the adventurers do something or go somewhere unexpected. As an actor, the DM plays the roles of the monsters and supporting characters, breathing life into them. And as a referee, the DM interprets the rules and decides when to abide by them and when to change them.": "地牢管理员可以戴上许多帽子。作为活动的设计者，DM通过放置怪物、陷阱和宝物来创造冒险，让其他玩家的角色（%0%）去发现。作为一个讲故事的人，DM帮助其他玩家想象他们周围发生的事情，当冒险者做一些事情或去一些意想不到的地方时，他就会即兴发挥。作为一个演员，DM扮演怪物和配角的角色，为他们注入活力。而作为裁判员，DM解释规则，决定何时遵守规则，何时改变规则。",
	"Inventing, writing, storytelling, improvising, acting, refereeing-every DM handles these roles differently, and you'll probably enjoy some more than others. It helps to remember that Dungeons & Dragons is a hobby, and being the DM should be fun. Focus on the aspects you enjoy and downplay the rest. For example, if you don't like creating your own adventures, you can use published ones. You can also lean on the other players to help you with rules mastery and world-building.": "发明、写作、讲故事、即兴创作、表演、裁判--每个DM处理这些角色的方式都不一样，你可能会比其他人更喜欢一些。记住 \"龙与地下城 \"是一种爱好，做管理员应该是有趣的。专注于你喜欢的方面，淡化其他方面。例如，如果你不喜欢创造你自己的冒险，你可以使用已出版的冒险。你也可以依靠其他玩家来帮助你掌握规则和构建世界。",
	"The D&D rules help you and the other players have a good time, but the rules aren't in charge. You're the DM, and you are in charge of the game. That said, your goal isn't to slaughter the adventurers but to create a campaign world that revolves around their actions and decisions, and to keep your players coming back for more! If you're lucky, the events of your campaign will echo in the memories of your players long after the final game session is concluded.": "D&D规则帮助你和其他玩家度过一段美好的时光，但规则并不负责任。你是管理员，你负责游戏的进行。也就是说，你的目标不是屠杀冒险者，而是创造一个围绕着他们的行动和决定的活动世界，并让你的玩家不断地回来找寻更多的东西 如果你运气好的话，你的战役事件在最后的游戏环节结束后还会在玩家的记忆中久久回荡。",
	"This book is organized in three parts. The first part helps you decide what kind of campaign you'd like to run. The second part helps you create the adventures-the stories-that will compose the campaign and keep the players entertained from one game session to the next. The last part helps you adjudicate the rules of the game and modify them to suit the style of your campaign.": "本书分为三部分。第一部分帮助你决定你想开展什么样的活动。第二部分帮助你创造冒险--故事--这些故事将构成竞选活动，使玩家从一个游戏环节到另一个游戏环节都能得到乐趣。最后一部分帮助你决定游戏规则，并修改它们以适应你的活动风格。",
	"Every DM is the creator of his or her own campaign world. Whether you invent a world, adapt a world from a favorite movie or novel, or use a published setting for the D&D game, you make that world your own over the course of a campaign.": "每个管理人都是他或她自己活动世界的创造者。无论你是发明了一个世界，还是从最喜欢的电影或小说中改编了一个世界，或者使用已出版的D&D游戏设定，你都会在活动过程中把这个世界变成你自己的。",
	"The world where you set your campaign is one of countless worlds that make up the D&D {@b multiverse}, a vast array of planes and worlds where adventures happen. Even if you're using an established world such as the Forgotten Realms, your campaign takes place in a sort of mirror universe of the official setting where Forgotten Realms novels, game products, and digital games are assumed to take place. The world is yours to change as you see fit and yours to modify as you explore the consequences of the players' actions.": "你设定竞选活动的世界是构成D&D{@b multiverse}的无数世界之一，是一系列冒险发生的星球和世界。即使你使用的是一个既定的世界，比如被遗忘的领域，你的活动也是发生在一种官方设定的镜像宇宙中，被遗忘的领域的小说、游戏产品和数字游戏都被认为是发生在这里。这个世界是你的，你可以根据自己的需要来改变，你可以在探索玩家行为的后果时对其进行修改。",
	"Your world is more than just a backdrop for adventures. Like Middle Earth, Westeros, and countless other fantasy worlds out there, it's a place to which you can escape and witness fantastic stories unfold. A well-designed and well-run world seems to flow around the adventurers, so that they feel part of something, instead of apart from it.": "你的世界不仅仅是一个冒险的背景。就像中土世界、维斯特洛和其他无数的幻想世界一样，它是一个你可以逃避并见证奇妙故事展开的地方。一个设计良好、运行良好的世界似乎围绕着冒险者流动，使他们感到自己是某些东西的一部分，而不是与它分离。",
	"Consistency is a key to a believable fictional world. When the adventurers go back into town for supplies, they should encounter the same {@b nonplayer characters} (NPCs) they met before. Soon, they'll learn the barkeep's name, and he or she will remember theirs as well. Once you have achieved this degree of consistency, you can provide an occasional change. If the adventurers come back to buy more horses at the stables, they might discover that the man who ran the place went back home to the large city over the hills, and now his niece runs the family business. That sort of change-one that has nothing to do with the adventurers directly, but one that they'll notice-makes the players feel as though their characters are part of a living world that changes and grows along with them.": "一致性是一个可信的虚构世界的关键。当冒险家们回到镇上购买补给品时，他们应该会遇到之前遇到的那些（%0%）（NPC）。很快，他们就会知道酒吧老板的名字，而他或她也会记住他们的名字。一旦你达到了这种程度的一致性，你就可以提供一个偶尔的变化。如果冒险者回来在马厩里买更多的马，他们可能会发现经营这个地方的人回到了山那边的大城市，现在他的侄女在经营家族生意。这种变化--与冒险者没有直接关系，但他们会注意到--使玩家感到他们的角色是一个活生生的世界的一部分，这个世界与他们一起变化和成长。",
	"Part 1 of this book is all about inventing your world. Chapter 1 asks what type of game you want to run, and helps you nail down a few important details about your world and its overarching conflicts. Chapter 2 helps you put your world in the greater context of the multiverse, expanding on the information presented in the {@i Player's Handbook} to discuss the planes of existence and the gods and how you can put them together to serve the needs of your campaign.": "本书的第一部分是关于发明你的世界。第1章问你想运行什么类型的游戏，并帮助你确定关于你的世界和其总体冲突的一些重要细节。第2章帮助你把你的世界放在多元宇宙的大背景下，在{@i Player's Handbook}中介绍的信息的基础上扩展，讨论存在平面和诸神，以及你如何把它们放在一起以满足你的活动的需要。",
	"Whether you write your own adventures or use published ones, expect to invest preparation time beyond the hours you spend at the gaming table. You'll need to carve out some free time to exercise your creativity as you invent compelling plots, create new NPCs, craft encounters, and think of clever ways to foreshadow story events yet to come.": "无论你是自己写冒险故事还是使用已出版的冒险故事，都需要投入准备时间，而不是在游戏桌前花费的时间。你需要抽出一些空闲时间来锻炼你的创造力，因为你要发明引人注目的情节，创造新的NPC，制作遭遇战，并想出巧妙的方法来预示即将发生的故事。",
	"Part 2 of this book is devoted to helping you create and run great adventures. Chapter 3 covers the basic elements of a D&D adventure, and chapter 4 helps you create memorable NPCs. Chapter 5 presents guidelines and advice for running adventures set in dungeons, the wilderness, and other locales, and chapter 6 covers the time between adventures. Chapter 7 is all about treasure, magic items, and special rewards that help keep the players invested in your campaign.": "本书的第二部分致力于帮助你创建和运行伟大的冒险。第3章介绍了D&D冒险的基本要素，第4章帮助你创建令人难忘的NPC。第5章介绍了在地下城、荒野和其他地方进行冒险的指南和建议，第6章涉及冒险之间的时间。第7章是关于宝藏、魔法物品和特殊奖励的内容，这些都有助于让玩家投入到你的活动中。",
	"Dungeons & Dragons isn't a head-to-head competition, but it needs someone who is impartial yet involved in the game to guarantee that everyone at the table plays by the rules. As the player who creates the game world and the adventures that take place within it, the DM is a natural fit to take on the referee role.": "龙与地下城并不是一场头对头的比赛，但它需要一个公正而又参与游戏的人，以保证桌子上的每个人都按规则行事。作为创造游戏世界和发生在其中的冒险的玩家，管理员自然适合担任裁判员的角色。",
	"As a referee, the DM acts as a mediator between the rules and the players. A player tells the DM what he or she wants to do, and the DM determines whether it is successful or not, in some cases asking the player to make a die roll to determine success. For example, if a player wants his or her character to take a swing at an orc, you say, \"Make an attack roll\" while looking up the orc's Armor Class.": "作为裁判员，DM在规则和玩家之间充当调解人。玩家告诉管理员他或她想做什么，而管理员则决定是否成功，在某些情况下，要求玩家进行掷骰子来决定是否成功。例如，如果玩家想让他或她的角色向一个兽人挥拳，你就说：\"做一个攻击卷\"，同时查一下兽人的装甲等级。",
	"The rules don't account for every possible situation that might arise during a typical D&D session. For example, a player might want his or her character to hurl a brazier full of hot coals into a monster's face. How you determine the outcome of this action is up to you. You might tell the player to make a Strength check, while mentally setting the {@b Difficulty Class} (DC) at 15. If the Strength check is successful, you then determine how a face full of hot coals affects the monster. You might decide that it deals {@dice 1d4} fire damage and imposes disadvantage on the monster's attack rolls until the end of its next turn. You roll the damage die (or let the player do it), and the game continues.": "这些规则并没有考虑到典型的D&D会议中可能出现的每一种情况。例如，玩家可能想让他或她的角色把一个装满热煤的火炉扔到怪物的脸上。如何决定这一行动的结果由你决定。你可以告诉玩家进行力量检查，同时在心理上将（%0%）（DC）设定为15。如果力量检查成功，你就会决定满脸的热煤对怪物的影响。你可以决定它造成{@dice 1d4}的火焰伤害，并对怪物的攻击卷轴施加不利因素，直到它的下一回合结束。你掷出伤害模子（或让玩家掷出），然后游戏继续。",
	"Sometimes mediating the rules means setting limits. If a player tells you, \"I want to run up and attack the orc,\" but the character doesn't have enough movement to reach the orc, you say, \"It's too far away to move up and still attack. What would you like to do instead?\" The player takes the information and comes up with a different plan.": "有时调解规则意味着设定限制。如果一个玩家告诉你，\"我想跑上去攻击那个兽人\"，但是角色没有足够的移动能力去接触那个兽人，你就说，\"它太远了，无法移动，而且还能攻击。你想怎么做呢？\" 玩家接受了这些信息，想出了一个不同的计划。",
	"To referee the rules, you need to know them. You don't have to memorize this book or the Player's Handbook, but you should have a clear idea of their contents so that, when a situation requires a ruling, you know where to find the proper reference.": "要做裁判，你需要了解这些规则。你不必记住这本书或玩家手册，但你应该对它们的内容有一个清晰的概念，这样，当有情况需要裁决时，你就知道在哪里可以找到适当的参考。",
	"The Player's Handbook contains the main rules you need to play the game. Part 3 of this book offers a wealth of information to help you adjudicate the rules in a wide variety of situations. Chapter 8 presents advice for using attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. It also includes options appropriate for certain play styles and campaigns, including guidelines for using miniatures, a system for handling chase scenes, and rules for madness. If you like to create your own stuff, such as new monsters, races, and character backgrounds, chapter 9 shows you how. That chapter also contains optional rules for unusual situations or play styles, such as the use of firearms in a fantasy setting.": "玩家手册》包含了你玩游戏所需的主要规则。本书第三部分提供了丰富的信息，帮助你在各种情况下对规则进行裁决。第8章介绍了使用攻击卷、能力检查和蓄力的建议。它还包括适合某些游戏风格和活动的选项，包括使用微型模型的指南、处理追逐场景的系统和疯狂规则。如果你喜欢创造自己的东西，比如新的怪物、种族和角色背景，第9章会告诉你如何做。这一章还包含了针对不寻常情况或玩法的可选规则，如在奇幻环境中使用枪支。",
	"The success of a D&D game hinges on your ability to entertain the other players at the game table. Whereas their role is to create characters (the protagonists of the campaign), breathe life into them, and help steer the campaign through their characters' actions, your role is to keep the players (and yourself) interested and immersed in the world you've created, and to let their characters do awesome things.": "D&D游戏的成功取决于你在游戏桌上招待其他玩家的能力。他们的作用是创造角色（活动的主角），为他们注入生命，并通过他们的角色行动来帮助引导活动，而你的作用是让玩家（和你自己）感兴趣并沉浸在你创造的世界中，并让他们的角色做一些了不起的事情。",
	"Knowing what your players enjoy most about the D&D game helps you create and run adventures that they will enjoy and remember. Once you know which of the following activities each player in your group enjoys the most, you can tailor adventures that satisfy your players' preferences as much as possible, thus keeping them engaged.": "了解你的玩家在D&D游戏中最喜欢什么，有助于你创建和运行他们会喜欢并记住的冒险。一旦你知道你的小组中的每个玩家最喜欢以下哪种活动，你就可以定制尽可能满足玩家喜好的冒险，从而保持他们的参与。",
	"Players who enjoy acting like getting into character and speaking in their characters' voices. Roleplayers at heart, they enjoy social interactions with NPCs, monsters, and their fellow party members.": "喜欢演戏的玩家，比如进入角色，用角色的声音说话。他们是内心深处的角色扮演者，喜欢与NPC、怪物和他们的同伴进行社交互动。",

	"This book, the {@i Player's Handbook}, and the {@i Monster Manual} present the default assumptions for how the worlds of D&D work. Among the established settings of D&D, the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Dragonlance, and Mystara don't stray very far from those assumptions. Settings such as Dark Sun, Eberron, Ravenloft, Spelljammer, and Planescape venture further away from that baseline. As you create your own world, it's up to you to decide where on the spectrum you want your world to fall.": "本书、{@i Player's Handbook}和{@i Monster Manual}提出了D&D世界如何运作的默认假设。在D&D的既定设定中，被遗忘的王国（Forgotten Realms）、灰鹰（Greyhawk）、龙之谷（Dragonlance）和秘境（Mystara）并没有偏离这些假设的范围。黑暗太阳、Eberron、Ravenloft、Spelljammer和Planescape等设定则进一步偏离了这一基线。当你创造你自己的世界时，你要决定你想让你的世界落在什么位置。",

	"The gods are real and embody a variety of beliefs, with each god claiming dominion over an aspect of the world, such as war, forests, or the sea. Gods exert influence over the world by granting divine magic to their followers and sending signs and portents to guide them. The follower of a god serves as an agent of that god in the world. The agent seeks to further the ideals of that god and defeat its rivals. While some folk might refuse to honor the gods, none can deny their existence.": "神是真实存在的，体现了各种信仰，每个神都声称对世界的某个方面有统治权，如战争、森林或海洋。众神通过向其追随者授予神圣的魔法，并发送征兆和预兆来引导他们，从而对世界施加影响。一个神的追随者作为该神在这个世界上的代理人。代理人寻求推进该神的理想并击败其对手。虽然有些人可能拒绝尊重神灵，但没有人能够否认他们的存在。",
	"Wild regions abound. City-states, confederacies, and kingdoms of various sizes dot the landscape, but beyond their borders the wilds crowd in. People know the area they live in well. They've heard stories of other places from merchants and travelers, but few know what lies beyond the mountains or in the depths of the great forest unless they've been there themselves.": "野生地区比比皆是。大大小小的城邦、邦联和王国点缀着这片土地，但在它们的边界之外，荒野拥挤不堪。人们对自己居住的地区非常了解。他们从商人和旅行者那里听说过其他地方的故事，但很少有人知道山外或大森林深处有什么，除非他们亲自去过那里。",
	"Empires rise and fall, leaving few places that have not been touched by imperial grandeur or decay. War, time, and natural forces eventually claim the mortal world, leaving it rich with places of adventure and mystery. Ancient civilizations and their knowledge survive in legends, magic items, and their ruins. Chaos and evil often follow an empire's collapse.": "帝国兴衰，很少有地方没有被帝国的宏伟或衰败所触动。战争、时间和自然力量最终夺走了凡人的世界，留下了丰富的冒险和神秘的地方。古代文明和他们的知识在传说、魔法物品和他们的废墟中幸存下来。混乱和邪恶往往伴随着一个帝国的崩溃。",
	"Powerful individuals strive to make their mark on the world, and factions of like-minded individuals can alter the course of history. Factions include religions led by charismatic prophets, kingdoms ruled by lasting dynasties, and shadowy societies that seek to master long-lost magic. The influence of such factions waxes and wanes as they compete with each other for power. Some seek to preserve the world and usher in a golden age. Others strive toward evil ends, seeking to rule the world with an iron fist. Still others seek goals that range from the practical to the esoteric, such as the accumulation of material wealth or the resurrection of a dead god. Whatever their goals, these factions inevitably collide, creating conflict that can steer the world's fate.": "有权势的人努力在这个世界上留下自己的印记，而志同道合的人组成的派别可以改变历史的进程。派别包括由有魅力的先知领导的宗教，由持久的王朝统治的王国，以及寻求掌握失传已久的魔法的阴暗社会。这些派别的影响力随着他们之间的权力竞争而消长。一些人寻求保护世界，迎来一个黄金时代。其他人则努力实现邪恶的目的，寻求用铁拳统治世界。还有一些人寻求从实用到深奥的目标，如积累物质财富或复活死去的神。无论他们的目标是什么，这些派别都不可避免地发生碰撞，产生冲突，从而引导世界的命运。",
	"Practitioners of magic are relatively few in number, but they leave evidence of their craft everywhere. The magic can be as innocuous and commonplace as a potion that heals wounds to something much more rare and impressive, such as a levitating tower or a stone golem guarding the gates of a city. Beyond the realms of civilization are caches of magic items guarded by magic traps, as well as magically constructed dungeons inhabited by monsters created by magic, cursed by magic, or endowed with magical abilities.": "魔法从业者的数量相对较少，但他们到处都留下了他们技艺的证据。这些魔法可以是无害的、普通的，如治疗伤口的药水，也可以是更罕见的、令人印象深刻的东西，如浮空塔或守卫城市大门的石雕。在文明的领域之外，还有由魔法陷阱守护的魔法物品库，以及由魔法创造的怪物、被魔法诅咒的怪物或被赋予魔法能力的怪物居住的魔法建造的地牢。",
	"In creating your campaign world, it helps to start with the core assumptions and consider how your setting might change them. The subsequent sections of this chapter address each element and give details on how to flesh out your world with gods, factions, and so forth. The assumptions sketched out above aren't carved in stone. They inspire exciting D&D worlds full of adventure, but they're not the only set of assumptions that can do so. You can build an interesting campaign concept by altering one or more of those core assumptions, just as well-established D&D worlds have done. Ask yourself, \"What if the standard assumptions weren't true in my world?\"": "在创建你的活动世界时，从核心假设开始，并考虑你的设定会如何改变它们，这是有帮助的。本章的后续章节将讨论每个要素，并详细介绍如何用神灵、派别等来充实你的世界。上面勾勒的假设并不是刻在石头上的。它们激发了令人兴奋的、充满冒险的D&D世界，但它们并不是唯一能够做到这一点的一套假设。你可以通过改变这些核心假设中的一个或多个来建立一个有趣的活动概念，就像成熟的D&D世界所做的那样。问问自己，\"如果标准的假设在我的世界里不是真的呢？\"",
	"What if magic is rare and dangerous, and even adventurers have limited or no access to it? What if your campaign is set in a version of our own world's history?": "如果魔法是罕见的、危险的，甚至冒险者也只能有限地或根本无法获得它，那该怎么办？如果你的活动设定在我们自己世界的历史版本中呢？",
	"What if your world is new, and the characters are the first of a long line of heroes? The adventurers might be champions of the first great empires, such as the empires of Netheril and Cormanthor in the Forgotten Realms setting.": "如果你的世界是新的，而角色是一长串英雄中的第一个呢？冒险家们可能是第一个伟大帝国的冠军，比如被遗忘的领域中的尼瑟尔和科曼托帝国。",
	"What if the world is completely charted and mapped, right down to the \"Here there be dragons\" notations? What if great empires cover huge stretches of countryside, with clearly defined borders between them? The Five Nations of the Eberron setting were once part of a great empire, and magically aided travel between its cities is commonplace.": "如果世界完全被绘制成地图，甚至包括 \"这里有龙 \"的标记，那会怎样？如果伟大的帝国覆盖了大片的乡村，它们之间有明确的边界，那会怎样？Eberron设定中的五国曾经是一个大帝国的一部分，在其城市之间进行魔法辅助的旅行是很常见的。",
	"What if monsters are rare and terrifying? In the Ravenloft setting, horrific domains are governed by monstrous rulers. The populace lives in perpetual terror of these darklords and their evil minions, but other monsters rarely trouble people's daily lives.": "如果怪兽是罕见的、可怕的呢？在《雷文洛夫特》的设定中，可怕的领地由畸形的统治者统治着。民众永远生活在对这些黑暗统治者及其邪恶爪牙的恐惧之中，但其他怪物却很少困扰人们的日常生活。",
	"What if every town is ruled by a powerful wizard? What if magic item shops are common? The Eberron setting makes the use of magic an everyday occurrence, as magical flying ships and trains carry travelers from one great city to another.": "如果每个城镇都被一个强大的巫师所统治呢？如果魔法物品商店很常见呢？Eberron的设定使魔法的使用成为一种日常现象，因为神奇的飞船和火车将旅行者从一个大城市带到另一个城市。",
	"What if the gods regularly walk the earth? What if the characters can challenge them and seize their power? Or what if the gods are remote, and even angels never make contact with mortals? In the Dark Sun setting, the gods are extremely distant-perhaps nonexistent-and clerics rely instead on elemental power for their magic.": "如果诸神定期在地球上行走呢？如果人物可以挑战他们并夺取他们的权力呢？或者，如果诸神很遥远，甚至天使也从不与凡人接触呢？在黑暗太阳的设定中，诸神非常遥远--也许是不存在的--而神职人员的魔法则依赖于元素的力量。",
	"Appendix B of the Player's Handbook presents a number of pantheons (loose groupings of deities not united by a single doctrine or philosophy) for use in your game, including the gods of established D&D worlds and fantasy-historical pantheons. You can adopt one of these pantheons for your campaign, or pick and choose deities and ideas from them as you please. See \"A Sample Pantheon\" in this section for an example. As far as the game's rules are concerned, it doesn't matter if your world has hundreds of deities or a church devoted to a single god. In rules terms, clerics choose domains, not deities, so your world can associate domains with deities in any way you choose.": "玩家手册》的附录B介绍了一些供你在游戏中使用的万神殿（不是由单一教义或哲学统一的松散的神灵组合），包括既定的D&D世界的神灵和幻想历史中的万神殿。你可以在你的活动中采用这些万神殿中的一个，也可以根据你的意愿从中挑选神灵和想法。请参阅本节中的 \"万神殿样本\"，了解一个例子。就游戏规则而言，如果你的世界有成百上千的神灵，或者只有一个教堂专门供奉一个神，这并不重要。在规则方面，牧师选择领域，而不是神灵，所以你的世界可以以任何你选择的方式将领域与神灵联系起来。",
	"Most D&D worlds have a loose pantheon of gods. A multitude of deities rule the various aspects of existence, variously cooperating with and competing against one another to administer the affairs of the universe. People gather in public shrines to worship gods of life and wisdom, or meet in hidden places to venerate gods of deception or destruction. Each deity in a pantheon has a portfolio and is responsible for advancing that portfolio. In the Greyhawk setting, Heironeous is a god of valor who calls clerics and paladins to his service and encourages them to spread the ideals of honorable warfare, chivalry, and justice in society. Even in the midst of his everlasting war with his brother Hextor, god of war and tyranny, Heironeous promotes his own portfolio: war fought nobly and in the cause of justice.": "大多数D&D世界都有一个松散的众神殿。众多的神灵统治着存在的各个方面，在管理宇宙事务时，他们相互合作或相互竞争。人们聚集在公共神殿中崇拜生命和智慧之神，或者在隐秘的地方聚会，敬仰欺骗或破坏之神。万神殿中的每个神灵都有一个组合，并负责推进该组合。在灰鹰的设定中，Heironeous是一位英勇之神，他召唤牧师和圣骑士为他服务，鼓励他们在社会上传播光荣的战争、骑士精神和正义的理想。即使在他与他的兄弟--战争和暴政之神海克斯托（Hextor）的永恒战争中，Heironeous也在宣传他自己的组合：为了正义而高尚地进行战争。",
	"People in most D&D worlds are polytheistic, honoring deities of their own and acknowledging pantheons of other cultures. Individuals pay homage to various gods, regardless of alignment. In the Forgotten Realms, a person might propitiate Umberlee before setting out to sea, join a communal feast to celebrate Chauntea at harvest time, and pray to Malar before going hunting.": "大多数D&D世界的人们都是多神论者，他们尊敬自己的神灵，也承认其他文化的万神殿。个人向不同的神灵致敬，而不考虑他们的取向。在被遗忘的领域，一个人可能会在出海前祭拜Umberlee，在收获季节参加庆祝Chauntea的集体宴会，并在打猎前向Malar祈祷。",
	"Some individuals feel a calling to a particular deity's service and claim that god as a patron. Particularly devoted individuals become priests by setting up a shrine or helping to staff a holy site. Much more rarely, those who feel such a calling become clerics or paladins invested with the responsibility of true divine power.": "有些人感到被召唤去为某一特定的神灵服务，并称该神为守护神。特别虔诚的人通过建立神龛或帮助圣地的工作人员成为牧师。更罕见的是，那些感受到这种召唤的人成为牧师或圣骑士，被赋予真正的神力的责任。",
	"Shrines and temples serve as community gathering points for religious rites and festivals. Priests at such sites relate stories of the gods, teach the ethics of their patron deities, offer advice and blessings, perform religious rites, and provide training in activities their deities favor. Cities and large towns can host several temples dedicated to individual gods important to the community, while smaller settlements might have a single shrine devoted to any gods the locals revere.": "祠堂和庙宇是社区宗教仪式和节日的聚集点。这些地方的祭司讲述神的故事，传授他们的守护神的道德观，提供建议和祝福，举行宗教仪式，并在他们的神灵所喜爱的活动中提供培训。城市和大城镇可以有几座寺庙，专门供奉对社区很重要的个别神灵，而较小的定居点可能有一座神龛，专门供奉当地人崇敬的任何神灵。",
	"To quickly build a pantheon for your world, create a single god for each of the eight domains available to clerics: Death, Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, and War. You can invent names and personalities for these deities, or borrow deities from other pantheons. This approach gives you a small pantheon that covers the most significant aspects of existence, and it's easy enough to extrapolate other areas of life each deity controls. The god of Knowledge, for example, might also be patron of magic and prophecy, while the god of Light could be the sun god and the god of time.": "为了迅速为你的世界建立一个万神殿，为神职人员可用的八个领域各创建一个神。死亡、知识、生命、光明、自然、暴风雨、诡计和战争。你可以为这些神灵发明名字和个性，或者从其他神殿借用神灵。这种方法为你提供了一个小型万神殿，涵盖了存在的最重要方面，而且很容易推断出每个神灵控制的其他生活领域。例如，知识之神也可能是魔法和预言的守护神，而光明之神可能是太阳神和时间之神。",
	"The pantheon of the Dawn War is an example of a pantheon assembled from mostly preexisting elements to suit the needs of a particular campaign. This is the default pantheon in the fourth edition {@i Player's Handbook (2008)}. The pantheon is summarized in the Dawn War Deities table.": "黎明之战的万神殿是一个例子，它是由大部分预先存在的元素组成的万神殿，以适应特定活动的需要。这是第四版中的默认万神殿（%0%）。该万神殿在 \"黎明之战神祗表 \"中进行了总结。",
	"This pantheon draws in several nonhuman deities and establishes them as universal gods. These gods include Bahamut, Corellon, Gruumsh, Lolth, Moradin, Sehanine, and Tiamat. Humans worship Moradin and Corellon as gods of their respective portfolios, rather than as racial deities. The pantheon also includes the archdevil Asmodeus as god of domination and tyranny.": "这个万神殿吸纳了几个非人类的神灵，并将他们确立为普遍的神灵。这些神包括巴哈姆特（Bahamut）、科瑞隆（Corellon）、格鲁姆什（Gruumsh）、洛特（Lolth）、莫拉丁（Moradin）、塞哈宁（Sehanine）和提亚马特（Tiamat）。人类将莫拉丁和科雷隆作为他们各自组合的神灵来崇拜，而不是作为种族神灵。万神殿还包括作为统治和暴政之神的大恶魔阿斯莫德。",
	"Several of the gods are drawn from other pantheons, sometimes with new names for the gods. Bane comes from the Forgotten Realms. From Greyhawk come Kord, Pelor, Tharizdun, and Vecna. From the Greek pantheon come Athena (renamed Erathis) and Tyche (renamed Avandra), though both are altered. Set (renamed Zehir) comes from the Egyptian pantheon. The Raven Queen is akin to the Norse pantheon's Hel and Greyhawk's Wee Jas. That leaves three gods created from scratch: Ioun, Melora, and Torog.": "有几位神灵来自其他万神殿，有时还为神灵取了新的名字。班恩来自被遗忘的领域。灰鹰（Greyhawk）的科德（Kord）、佩罗（Pelor）、塔里兹顿（Tharizdun）和维克纳（Vecna）。希腊万神殿的雅典娜（改名为Erathis）和泰切（改名为Avandra），尽管两者都被改变了。Set（改名为Zehir）来自埃及的万神殿。乌鸦女王类似于北欧万神殿的赫尔和灰鹰城的韦亚斯。这就留下了三个从头开始创造的神。伊翁、梅罗拉和托罗格。",

	"In contrast to a loose pantheon, a tight pantheon focuses on a single religion whose teachings and edicts embrace a small group of deities. Followers of a tight pantheon might favor one of its member deities over another, but they respect all the deities and honor them with sacrifices and prayer as appropriate.": "与松散的万神殿相反，严密的万神殿专注于一个单一的宗教，其教义和法令包括一小群神灵。严密万神殿的追随者可能会偏爱其中一个成员的神灵，但他们尊重所有的神灵，并在适当的时候用祭品和祈祷向他们致敬。",
	"The key trait to a tight pantheon is that its worshipers embrace a single ethos or dogma that includes all the deities. The gods of the tight pantheon work as one to protect and guide their followers. You can think of a tight pantheon as similar to a family. One or two deities who lead the pantheon serve as parent figures, with the rest serving as patrons of important aspects of the culture that worships the pantheon. A single temple honors all members of the pantheon.": "严密万神殿的关键特征是其崇拜者接受一个包括所有神灵的单一精神或教条。严密万神殿的神灵作为一个整体来保护和引导他们的追随者。你可以把严密万神殿想象成类似于一个家庭。一个或两个领导万神殿的神灵作为家长人物，其他神灵作为崇拜万神殿的文化的重要方面的赞助人。一座寺庙就会向万神殿的所有成员致敬。",
	"Most tight pantheons have one or more aberrant gods-deities whose worship isn't sanctioned by the priests of the pantheon as a whole. These are usually evil deities and enemies of the pantheon, such as the Greek Titans. These deities have cults of their own, attracting social outcasts and villains to their worship.": "大多数严密的万神殿都有一个或多个反常的神--其崇拜不被整个万神殿的祭司所认可的神。这些通常是邪恶的神灵和万神殿的敌人，如希腊泰坦。这些神灵有自己的崇拜，吸引着社会上的弃儿和恶棍来崇拜他们。",
	"These cults resemble mystery cults, their members strictly devoted to their single god, though even members of aberrant cults pay lip service in the temples of the tight pantheon.": "这些教派类似于神秘教派，其成员严格献身于他们的单一神灵，尽管即使是反常教派的成员也会在严格的万神殿中进行口头服务。",
	"The Norse deities serve as an example of a tight pantheon. Odin is the pantheon's leader and father figure. Deities such as Thor, Tyr, and Freya embody important aspects of Norse culture. Meanwhile, Loki and his devotees lurk in the shadows, sometimes aiding the other deities, and sometimes working against them with the pantheon's enemies.": "北欧的神灵是一个紧密的万神殿的例子。奥丁是万神殿的领袖和父亲形象。雷神、泰尔和芙蕾雅等神灵体现了北欧文化的重要方面。同时，洛基和他的信徒潜伏在暗处，有时帮助其他神灵，有时与万神殿的敌人一起对抗他们。",
	"A mystery cult is a secretive religious organization based on a ritual of initiation, in which the initiate is mystically identified with a god, or a handful of related gods. Mystery cults are intensely personal, concerned with the initiate's relationship with the divine.": "神秘邪教是一种基于入教仪式的秘密宗教组织，在这种仪式中，入教者被神秘地认同于一个神或少数几个相关的神。神秘邪教是强烈的个人化的，关注入门者与神的关系。",
	"Sometimes a mystery cult is a type of worship within a pantheon. It acknowledges the myths and rituals of the pantheon, but presents its own myths and rites as primary. For instance, a secretive order of monks might immerse themselves in a mystical relationship to a god who is part of a broadly worshiped pantheon.": "有时，神秘崇拜是万神殿内的一种崇拜类型。它承认万神殿的神话和仪式，但把自己的神话和仪式作为主要内容。例如，一个秘密的僧侣团体可能会将自己沉浸在与一个属于广泛崇拜的万神殿的神的神秘关系中。",
	"A mystery cult emphasizes the history of its god, which is symbolically reenacted in its initiation ritual. The foundation myth of a mystery cult is usually simple and often involves a god's death and rising, or a journey to the underworld and a return. Mystery cults often revere sun and moon deities and agricultural deities—gods whose portfolios reflect the cycles of nature.": "神秘崇拜强调其神的历史，在其入教仪式中象征性地重现了这一历史。神秘崇拜的基础神话通常很简单，通常涉及到一个神的死亡和复活，或一个前往冥界的旅程和返回。神秘崇拜通常崇尚太阳和月亮神以及农业神，这些神的组合反映了自然界的周期。",
	"The cult's ritual of initiation follows the pattern of its foundation myth. Neophytes retrace the god's footsteps in order to share the god's ultimate fate. In the case of dying and rising gods, the symbolic death of the initiate represents the idea of death to the old life and rebirth into a transformed existence. Initiates are born into a new life, remaining in the world of mortal affairs but feeling elevated to a higher sphere. The initiate is promised a place in the god's realm after death, but also experiences new meaning in life.": "该邪教的入教仪式遵循其基础神话的模式。新人追寻神的脚步，以分享神的最终命运。在垂死的神和崛起的神的情况下，入会者的象征性死亡代表了对旧生活的死亡和重生到一个转变的存在的想法。入门者出生在一个新的生活中，留在凡人的世界里，但感觉被提升到一个更高的境界。入门者被许诺死后在神的领域中占有一席之地，但同时也体验到生活的新意义。",
	"The divine beings of the multiverse are often categorized according to their cosmic power. Some gods are worshiped on multiple worlds and have a different rank on each world, depending on their influence there.": "多元宇宙的神灵通常根据其宇宙力量进行分类。有些神灵在多个世界受到崇拜，在每个世界都有不同的等级，这取决于他们在那里的影响力。",
	"{@b Greater deities} are beyond mortal understanding. They can't be summoned, and they are almost always removed from direct involvement in mortal affairs. On very rare occasions they manifest avatars similar to lesser deities, but slaying a greater god's avatar has no effect on the god itself.": "{@b Greater deities}是凡人无法理解的。他们不能被召唤，而且他们几乎总是不直接参与凡人的事务。在非常罕见的情况下，他们会显现出类似于小神的化身，但杀死大神的化身对神本身没有影响。",
	"{@b Lesser deities} are embodied somewhere in the planes. Some lesser deities live in the Material Plane, as does the unicorn-goddess Lurue of the Forgotten Realms and the titanic shark-god Sekolah revered by the sahuagin. Others live on the Outer Planes, as Lolth does in the Abyss. Such deities can be encountered by mortals.": "{@b Lesser deities}都体现在各个位面的某个地方。一些较小的神灵生活在物质界，如被遗忘的领域中的独角兽女神露露和萨瓦金人所敬仰的泰坦鲨鱼神塞科拉。其他人则生活在外部星球上，如深渊中的洛尔思。凡人可以遇到这样的神祗。",
	"{@b Quasi-deities} have a divine origin, but they don't hear or answer prayers, grant spells to clerics, or control aspects of mortal life. They are still immensely powerful beings, and in theory they could ascend to godhood if they amassed enough worshipers. Quasi-deities fall into three subcategories: demigods, titans, and vestiges.": "{@b Quasi-deities}有神圣的起源，但他们不听或不回答祈祷，不授予牧师法术，或控制凡人生活的各个方面。他们仍然是非常强大的生命，理论上，如果他们积累了足够的崇拜者，他们可以升为神。准神分为三个子类别：半神、泰坦和遗迹。",
	"{@i Demigods} are born from the union of a deity and a mortal being. They have some divine attributes, but their mortal parentage makes them the weakest quasi-deities.": "{@i Demigods}是由一个神灵和一个凡人的结合而生。他们有一些神性属性，但他们的凡人父母身份使他们成为最弱的准神。",
	"{@i Titans} are the divine creations of deities. They might be birthed from the union of two deities, manufactured on a divine forge, born from the blood spilled by a god, or otherwise brought about through divine will or substance.": "{@i Titans}是神祗的神圣创造物。他们可能是从两个神灵的结合中诞生的，在一个神圣的锻造厂制造的，从一个神灵的血液中诞生的，或者通过神圣的意志或物质带来的其他方式。",
	"{@i Vestiges} are deities who have lost nearly all their worshipers and are considered dead, from a mortal perspective. Esoteric rituals can sometimes contact these beings and draw on their latent power.": "{@i Vestiges}是那些几乎失去了所有崇拜者的神灵，从凡人的角度来看，他们被认为已经死亡。神秘的仪式有时可以与这些生命接触，汲取他们的潜在力量。",
	"Monotheistic religions revere only one deity, and in some cases, deny the existence of any other deity. If you introduce a monotheistic religion into your campaign, you need to decide whether other gods exist. Even if they don't, other religions can exist side by side with the monotheistic religion. If these religions have clerics with spellcasting ability, their spells might be powered by the one true deity, by lesser spirits who aren't deities (possibly including powerful aberrations, celestials, fey, fiends, or elementals), or simply by their faith.": "一神教只敬重一个神，在某些情况下，否认任何其他神的存在。如果你在你的战役中引入了一神教，你需要决定其他神是否存在。即使它们不存在，其他宗教也可以与一神教并存。如果这些宗教有具有法术能力的牧师，他们的法术可能是由唯一的真神、不是神的较小的精神（可能包括强大的反常者、天人、妖怪、魔人或元素），或者仅仅是由他们的信仰提供的。",
	"The deity of a monotheistic religion has an extensive portfolio and is portrayed as the creator of everything, in control of everything, and concerned with every aspect of existence. Thus, a worshiper of this god offers prayers and sacrifices to the same god regardless of what aspect of life is in need of divine assistance. Whether marching into war, setting off on a journey, or hoping to win someone's affections, the worshiper prays to the same god.": "一神教的神灵有广泛的组合，被描绘成万物的创造者，控制着一切，关注着生存的每一个方面。因此，这种神的崇拜者无论在生活的哪个方面需要神的帮助，都要向同一个神祈祷和献祭。无论是行军打仗，还是出发旅行，或者希望赢得某人的感情，崇拜者都向同一个神祈祷。",
	"Some monotheistic religions describe different aspects of their deity. A single god appears in different aspects as the Creator and the Destroyer, and the clerics of that god focus on one aspect or the other, determining their domain access and possibly even their alignment on that basis. A cleric who venerates the Destroyer aspect chooses the Tempest or War domain, while one who worships a Creator aspect chooses the Life or Nature domains. In some monotheistic religions, clerics group themselves into distinct religious orders to differentiate clerics who choose different domains.": "一些一神教描述了他们神灵的不同方面。一个单一的神在不同的方面出现，如创造者和毁灭者，该神的神职人员专注于一个方面或另一个方面，在此基础上决定他们的领域权限，甚至可能是他们的排列。崇拜毁灭者的神职人员选择暴风雨或战争领域，而崇拜创造者的神职人员则选择生命或自然领域。在一些一神教中，教士们将自己分成不同的宗教团体，以区分选择不同领域的教士。",
	"A dualistic religion views the world as the stage for a conflict between two diametrically opposed deities or divine forces. Most often, the opposed forces are good and evil, or opposed deities representing those forces. In some pantheons, the forces or deities of law and chaos are the fundamental opposites in a dualistic system. Life and death, light and darkness, matter and spirit, body and mind, health and illness, purity and defilement, positive energy and negative energy-the D&D universe is full of polar opposites that could serve as the foundation for a dualistic religion. Whatever the terms in which the dualism is expressed, half of the pair is usually believed to be good-beneficial, desirable, or holy-while the other half is considered bad, if not explicitly evil. If the fundamental conflict in a religion is expressed as the opposition between matter and spirit, the followers of that religion believe that one of the two (usually matter) is evil and the other (spirit) is good, and so seek to liberate their spirits from this material world and its evils through asceticism and contemplation.": "二元论宗教认为世界是两个截然相反的神灵或神性力量之间的冲突舞台。大多数情况下，对立的力量是善与恶，或代表这些力量的对立神灵。在一些万神殿中，法律和混乱的力量或神灵是二元体系中的基本对立面。生命与死亡、光明与黑暗、物质与精神、身体与心灵、健康与疾病、纯洁与污秽、正能量与负能量--D&D宇宙充满了两极对立，可以作为二元论宗教的基础。无论二元论以何种方式表达，这对二元论的一半通常被认为是好的--有益的、可取的或神圣的，而另一半则被认为是坏的，如果不是明确的邪恶。如果一个宗教的基本冲突被表述为物质和精神的对立，那么该宗教的信徒就认为两者中的一个（通常是物质）是邪恶的，另一个（精神）是好的，因此寻求通过禁欲主义和沉思将他们的精神从这个物质世界及其邪恶中解放出来。",
	"Rare dualistic systems believe that the two opposing forces must remain in balance, always pulling away from each other but remaining bound together in creative tension.": "罕见的二元论系统认为，两种对立的力量必须保持平衡，总是相互拉开距离，但在创造性的张力中保持结合。",
	"In a cosmology defined by an eternal conflict between good and evil, mortals are expected to take sides. The majority of those who follow a dualistic religion worship the deity or force identified as good. Worshipers of the good deity trust themselves to that god's power to protect them from the evil deity's minions. Because the evil deity in such a religion is usually the source of everything that is detrimental to existence, only the perverse and depraved worship this god. Monsters and fiends serve it, as do certain secretive cults. The myths of a dualistic religion usually predict that the good deity will triumph in an apocalyptic battle, but the forces of evil believe that the outcome of that battle isn't predetermined and work to promote their deity's victory.": "在一个由善与恶之间的永恒冲突所定义的宇宙论中，凡人被期望选边站。大多数信奉二元论宗教的人都崇拜被认定为善的神灵或力量。善神的崇拜者相信自己有神的力量来保护他们不受恶神的奴役。因为这种宗教中的邪神通常是一切不利于生存的根源，所以只有变态和堕落的人才会崇拜这个神。怪兽和恶魔为其服务，某些秘密的邪教也是如此。二元论宗教的神话通常预测善神将在世界末日之战中取得胜利，但邪恶势力认为这场战斗的结果并不是预先确定的，并努力促进他们的神的胜利。",
	"Deities in a dualistic system maintain large portfolios. All aspects of existence reflect the dualistic struggle, and therefore all things can fall on one side or the other of the conflict. Agriculture, mercy, the sky, medicine, and poetry reside in the portfolio of the good deity, and famine, hatred, disease, and war belong to the evil deity.": "二元系统中的神灵保持着大量的投资组合。存在的所有方面都反映了二元论的斗争，因此，所有事物都可能落在冲突的一方或另一方。农业、仁慈、天空、医药和诗歌属于善神的组合，而饥荒、仇恨、疾病和战争则属于恶神。",
	"Animism is the belief that spirits inhabit every part of the natural world. In an animistic worldview, everything has a spirit, from the grandest mountain to the lowliest rock, from the great ocean to a babbling brook, from the sun and moon to a fighter's ancestral sword. All these objects, and the spirits that inhabit them, are sentient, though some are more aware, alert, and intelligent than others. The most powerful spirits might even be considered deities. All are worthy of respect if not veneration.": "万物有灵论是一种信仰，认为自然界的每一部分都有灵。在万物有灵论的世界观中，一切都有灵，从最宏伟的山峰到最低矮的岩石，从巨大的海洋到潺潺的小溪，从太阳和月亮到战士的祖先之剑。所有这些物体，以及居住在它们身上的精神，都是有生命的，尽管有些比其他物体更有意识，更警觉，更聪明。最强大的精神甚至可能被视为神灵。所有这些都是值得尊重的，如果不是崇敬的话。",
	"Animists don't typically pay allegiance to one spirit over the others. Instead, they offer prayers and sacrifices to different spirits at different times, as appropriate to the situation. A pious character might make daily prayers and offerings to ancestor spirits and the spirits of the house, regular petitions to important spirits such as the Seven Fortunes of Good Luck, occasional sacrifices of incense to location spirits such as the spirit of a forest, and sporadic prayers to a host of other spirits as well.": "万物有灵论者通常不会向一个神灵效忠，而向其他神灵效忠。相反，他们在不同的时间向不同的神灵祈祷和献祭，以适应情况的需要。一个虔诚的人物可能会每天向祖先的神灵和房子的神灵祈祷和献祭，定期向重要的神灵如七福神请愿，偶尔向地点的神灵如森林的神灵献上香火，以及向许多其他神灵零星祈祷。",
	"An animistic religion is very tolerant. Most spirits don't care to whom a character also offers sacrifices, as long as they receive the sacrifices and respect they are due. As new religions spread through animist lands, those religions typically win adherents but not converts. People incorporate new spirits and deities into their prayers without displacing the old ones. Contemplatives and scholars adopt complex philosophical systems and practices without changing their belief in and respect for the spirits they already venerate.": "一个万物有灵的宗教是非常宽容的。大多数神灵并不关心一个角色也向谁提供祭品，只要他们得到应有的祭品和尊重。当新的宗教在万物有灵论的土地上传播时，这些宗教通常会赢得信徒，但不是皈依者。人们将新的精神和神灵纳入他们的祈祷中，而不会取代旧的精神和神灵。沉思者和学者们采用复杂的哲学体系和实践，而不改变他们对已经崇敬的神灵的信仰和尊重。",
	"Animism functions as a large tight pantheon. Animist clerics serve the pantheon as a whole, and so can choose any domain, representing a favorite spirit for that cleric.": "万物有灵论的功能是一个大型的紧密的万神殿。万物有灵教的教士为整个万神殿服务，因此可以选择任何领域，代表该教士最喜欢的精神。",
	"Not all divine powers need to be derived from deities. In some campaigns, believers hold enough conviction in their ideas about the universe that they gain magical power from that conviction. In other campaigns, impersonal forces of nature or magic replace the gods by granting power to mortals attuned to them. Just as druids and rangers can gain their spell ability from the force of nature rather than from a specific nature deity, some clerics devote themselves to ideals rather than to a god. Paladins might serve a philosophy of justice and chivalry rather than a specific deity.": "并非所有的神力都需要来自神灵。在一些活动中，信徒们对他们关于宇宙的想法持有足够的信念，他们从这种信念中获得了神奇的力量。在其他战役中，非个人的自然或魔法力量取代了神灵，将力量授予与之相适应的凡人。就像德鲁伊和游侠可以从自然之力而不是特定的自然神灵那里获得法术能力一样，一些牧师将自己奉献给理想而不是神灵。圣骑士可能服务于一种正义和骑士精神的哲学，而不是一个特定的神灵。",
	"Forces and philosophies aren't worshiped; they aren't beings that can hear and respond to prayers or accept sacrifices. Devotion to a philosophy or a force isn't necessarily exclusive of service to a deity. A person can be devoted to the philosophy of good and offer worship to various good deities, or revere the force of nature and also pay homage to the gods of nature, who might be seen as personal manifestations of an impersonal force. In a world that includes deities with demonstrable power (through their clerics), it's unusual for a philosophy to deny the existence of deities, although a common philosophical belief states that the deities are more like mortals than they would have mortals believe. According to such philosophies, the gods aren't truly immortal (just very long-lived), and mortals can attain divinity. In fact, ascending to godhood is the ultimate goal of some philosophies.": "力量和哲学不受崇拜；它们不是能听到并回应祈祷或接受祭品的生命。对一种哲学或一种力量的奉献并不一定与对神灵的服务相排斥。一个人可以献身于善的哲学，并向各种善的神灵提供崇拜，或者崇尚自然的力量，同时也向自然之神致敬，他们可能被视为一种非个人力量的个人表现。在一个包括具有可证明力量的神灵（通过他们的神职人员）的世界里，一种哲学否认神灵的存在是不寻常的，尽管一种常见的哲学信念指出，神灵比他们让凡人相信的更像凡人。根据这种哲学，神灵并非真正不朽（只是非常长寿），凡人可以达到神性。事实上，提升为神是一些哲学的最终目标。",
	"The power of a philosophy stems from the belief that mortals invest in it. A philosophy that only one person believes in isn't strong enough to bestow magical power on that person.": "哲学的力量源于凡人对它的信仰。只有一个人相信的哲学并不足以赋予这个人神奇的力量。",
	"When it comes to the gods, humans exhibit a far wider range of beliefs and institutions than other races do. In many D&D settings, orcs, elves, dwarves, goblins, and other humanoids have tight pantheons. It is expected that an orc will worship Gruumsh or one of a handful of subordinate deities. In comparison, humanity embraces a staggering variety of deities. Each human culture might have its own array of gods.": "谈到神灵，人类表现出的信仰和制度远比其他种族广泛。在许多D&D设定中，兽人、精灵、矮人、地精和其他人类都有严格的神殿。预计兽人将崇拜格鲁姆什或少数几个附属神灵中的一个。相比之下，人类拥护的神灵种类多得惊人。每个人类文化都可能有自己的神灵阵列。",
	"In most D&D settings, there is no single god that can claim to have created humanity. Thus, the human proclivity for building institutions extends to religion. A single charismatic prophet can convert an entire kingdom to the worship of a new god. With that prophet's death, the religion might wax or wane, or the prophet's followers might turn against one another and found several competing religions.": "在大多数D&D设定中，没有一个神可以声称创造了人类。因此，人类建立机构的倾向性也延伸到了宗教。一个有魅力的先知可以让整个王国的人崇拜一个新的神。随着先知的死亡，该宗教可能会消亡，或者先知的追随者们可能会反目成仇，成立几个相互竞争的宗教。",
	"In comparison, religion in dwarven society is set in stone. The dwarves of the Forgotten Realms identify Moradin as their creator. While individual dwarves might follow other gods, as a culture the dwarves are pledged to Moradin and the pantheon he leads. His teachings and magic are so thoroughly ingrained in dwarven culture that it would take a cataclysmic shift to replace him.": "相比之下，矮人社会的宗教是固定的。被遗忘的王国的矮人将莫拉丁视为他们的创造者。虽然个别矮人可能会追随其他神灵，但作为一种文化，矮人对莫拉丁和他领导的万神殿是有承诺的。他的教义和魔法在矮人文化中根深蒂固，要想取代他，就必须进行一场大灾难。",
	"With that in mind, consider the role of the gods in your world and their ties to different humanoid races. Does each race have a creator god? How does that god shape that race's culture? Are other folk free of such divine ties and free to worship as they wish? Has a race turned against the god that created it? Has a new race appeared, created by a god within the past few years? A deity might also have ties to a kingdom, noble line, or other cultural institution. With the death of the emperor, a new ruler might be selected by divine portents sent by the deity who protected the empire in its earliest days. In such a land, the worship of other gods might be outlawed or tightly controlled.": "考虑到这一点，考虑诸神在你的世界中的作用以及他们与不同人种的关系。每个种族都有一个创造者之神吗？该神如何塑造该种族的文化？其他民族是否没有这种神的联系，可以自由地按自己的意愿进行崇拜？一个种族是否已经背叛了创造它的神？是否出现了一个新的种族，在过去几年内由一个神创造？一个神灵也可能与一个王国、贵族阶层或其他文化机构有联系。随着皇帝的死亡，新的统治者可能是由早期保护帝国的神灵发出的神兆来选择的。在这样的土地上，对其他神灵的崇拜可能被禁止或被严格控制。",
	"Finally, consider the difference between gods who are tied to specific humanoid races and gods with more diverse followers. Do the races with their own pantheons enjoy a place of privilege in your world, with their gods taking an active role in their affairs? Are the other races ignored by the gods, or are those races the deciding factor that can tilt the balance of power in favor of one god or another?": "最后，考虑与特定人形种族相联系的神和拥有更多不同追随者的神之间的区别。拥有自己万神殿的种族在你的世界中是否享有特权，他们的神在他们的事务中发挥着积极作用？其他种族是否被诸神忽视，或者这些种族是否是能够使权力的天平向一个或另一个神倾斜的决定性因素？",
	"When creating the world where your campaign takes place, you'll want a map. You can take one of two approaches with it: top-down or bottom-up. Some DMs like to start at the top, creating the big picture of the world at the start of the campaign by having a map that shows whole continents, and then zooming in on smaller areas. Other DMs prefer to go the opposite direction, starting with a small campaign area that is mapped at a province or kingdom scale, then zooming out as adventures take the characters into new territory. Whichever approach you take, hexes work well for mapping outdoor environments where travel can go in any direction and calculating distance might be important. A single sheet of hex paper with 5 hexes to the inch is ideal for most maps. Use a scale for your map that's best suited to the level of detail you want. Chapter 7 offers more information about creating and mapping wilderness areas.": "当创建你的活动发生的世界时，你会想要一张地图。你可以采取两种方法中的一种：自上而下或自下而上。有些DM喜欢从头开始，在战役开始时通过一张显示整个大陆的地图来创建世界的大画面，然后再放大到较小的区域。其他DM喜欢反其道而行之，从一个小的战役区域开始，以省或王国为单位绘制地图，然后随着冒险将人物带入新的领域而放大。无论你采取哪种方法，六边形都能很好地绘制户外环境，在这种环境中，旅行可以向任何方向进行，计算距离可能很重要。一张每英寸5个六角的六角纸是大多数地图的理想选择。为你的地图使用一个最适合你想要的详细程度的比例。第七章提供了更多关于创建和绘制荒野地区的信息。",
	"For the most detailed areas of your world, use a province scale where each hex represents 1 mile. A full-page map at this scale represents an area that can be covered in one day's travel in any direction from the center of the map, assuming clear terrain. As such, province scale is a useful scale for mapping a campaign's starting area (see \"Creating a Campaign,\" later in this chapter) or any location where you expect to track the adventurers' movement in hours rather than days.": "对于你的世界中最详细的区域，使用省的比例尺，每个六角代表1英里。在这种比例尺下，一张整页的地图所代表的区域，在假设地形清晰的情况下，从地图中心的任何方向出发，一天的行程都可以覆盖。因此，省的比例尺对于绘制战役的起始区（见本章后面的 \"创建战役\"）或任何你希望以小时而不是以天为单位跟踪冒险者行动的地点来说是很有用的。",
	"The ground cover of an area this size will include broad stretches of one predominant terrain type, broken up by other isolated terrain types.": "这种规模的地区的地面覆盖将包括一种主要地形类型的广泛延伸，并被其他孤立的地形类型打破。",
	"A settled region mapped at this scale might have one town and eight to twelve villages or farming hamlets. A wilder region might have only a single keep, or no settlements at all. You can also indicate the extent of the cleared farmland that surrounds each city or town. On a province-scale map, this will show as a belt a few hexes wide surrounding each town or village. Even small villages farm most of the arable land within a mile or two.": "在这种规模的地图上，一个定居地区可能有一个城镇和8至12个村庄或农庄。一个比较荒凉的地区可能只有一个村庄，或者根本就没有定居点。你还可以指出每个城市或城镇周围的农田被清理的范围。在全省范围的地图上，这将显示为围绕每个城镇或村庄的几个六分之一宽的地带。即使是小村庄也会在一两英里内耕种大部分的可耕地。",
	"On a kingdom-scale map, each hex represents 6 miles. A map at this scale covers a large region, about the size of Great Britain or half the size of the state of California. That's plenty of room for adventuring.": "在王国规模的地图上，每个六角代表6英里。这种比例尺的地图涵盖了一个很大的区域，大约是大不列颠的大小或加利福尼亚的一半大小。这为冒险活动提供了足够的空间。",
	"The first step of mapping a region at this scale is to sketch out the coastlines and any major bodies of water in the area. Is the region landlocked or on a coast? A coastal region might include islands offshore, and a landlocked area might include an inland sea or major lakes. Alternatively, the region could consist of a single large island, or an isthmus or peninsula with multiple coastlines. Next, sketch in any major mountain ranges. Foothills form a transition between the mountains and lowlands, and broad patches of gentle hills might dot the region. That leaves the rest of your map for relatively flat terrain: grasslands, forests, swamps, and the like. Place these elements as you see fit.": "以这种比例绘制地区地图的第一步是勾勒出该地区的海岸线和任何主要水体。该地区是内陆地区还是沿海地区？沿海地区可能包括离岸的岛屿，而内陆地区可能包括内陆海或主要湖泊。另外，该地区可能由一个大岛，或一个有多条海岸线的地峡或半岛组成。接下来，勾画出任何主要的山脉。山麓是山区和低地之间的过渡，宽阔的丘陵可能会点缀该地区。这就为地图的其余部分留下了相对平坦的地形：草原、森林、沼泽，等等。按你认为合适的方式放置这些元素。",
	"Map out the courses of any rivers that flow through the area. Rivers are born in mountains or inland areas that see a lot of rainfall, winding down to the nearest major body of water that doesn't require the river to cross over higher elevation. Tributaries join rivers as they grow larger and move toward a lake or the sea.": "绘制出流经该地区的任何河流的路线。河流诞生于山区或降雨量大的内陆地区，蜿蜒流向最近的主要水体，不需要河流跨越高海拔。当河流变大并向湖泊或海洋移动时，支流会加入河流。",
	"Finally, place the major towns and cities of the region. At this scale, you don't need to worry about small towns and villages, or about mapping every belt of farmland. Even so, a settled region this size might easily have eight to twelve cities or towns to put on the map.": "最后，放置该地区的主要城镇。在这种规模下，你不需要担心小城镇和村庄，也不需要担心绘制每条农田带。即便如此，这么大的一个定居地区可能很容易就有八到十二个城市或城镇要放在地图上。",
	"For mapping a whole continent, use a scale where 1 hex represents 60 miles. At this scale, you can't see more than the shape of coastlines, the biggest mountain ranges, major rivers, huge lakes, and political boundaries. A map at this scale is best for showing how multiple kingdom-scale maps fit together, rather than tracking the movement of adventurers day by day.": "对于绘制整个大陆的地图，使用的比例尺是1个六边形代表60英里。在这种比例尺下，你只能看到海岸线的形状、最大的山脉、主要河流、巨大的湖泊和政治边界。这种比例尺的地图最适合于展示多个王国规模的地图是如何结合在一起的，而不是逐日追踪冒险者的行动。",
	"The same process you use for mapping a region at kingdom scale works for mapping a whole continent. A continent might have eight to twelve large cities that deserve a place on the map, most likely major trade centers and the capitals of kingdoms.": "你在绘制王国规模的地区地图时使用的程序也适用于绘制整个大陆的地图。一个大陆可能有8到12个值得在地图上占有一席之地的大型城市，很可能是主要的贸易中心和王国的首都。",
	"Whichever scale you start with, it's easy to zoom in or out on your maps. At continent scale, 1 hex represents the same area as 10 kingdom-scale hexes. Two cities that are 3 hexes (180 miles) apart on your continent map would be 30 hexes apart on your kingdom map, and might define the opposite ends of the region you're detailing. At kingdom scale, 1 hex equals 6 province-scale hexes, so it's easy to put the region covered by your province-scale map into the center of a kingdom-scale map and create interesting areas around it.": "无论你从哪种比例开始，都很容易放大或缩小你的地图。在大陆比例尺上，1个六边形代表与10个王国比例尺相同的区域。在大陆地图上相距3个六边形（180英里）的两个城市，在王国地图上则相距30个六边形，它们可能是你所描述的地区的两端。在王国比例尺上，1个六边形等于6个省比例尺的六边形，因此很容易将省比例尺地图所覆盖的区域放到王国比例尺地图的中心，并在其周围创建有趣的区域。",
	"The places where people live-bustling cities, prosperous towns, and tiny villages nestled among miles of farmland-help define the nature of civilization in your world. A single settlement—a home base for your adventurers-is a great place to start a campaign and begin your world building. Consider the following questions as you create any settlement in your world:": "人们居住的地方--喧嚣的城市、繁荣的城镇和依偎在数英里农田中的小村庄--有助于确定你的世界中文明的性质。一个单一的定居点--你的冒险者的大本营--是一个开始活动和开始你的世界建设的好地方。当你在你的世界中创建任何定居点时，请考虑以下问题。",

	"A settlement exists primarily to facilitate the story and fun of your campaign. Other than that point, the settlement's purpose determines the amount of detail you put into it.

	"A settlement might serve as a place where the characters stop to rest and to buy supplies. A settlement of this sort needs no more than a brief description. Include the settlement's name, decide how big it is, add a dash of flavor (\"The smell of the local tanneries never lifts from this town\"), and let the adventurers get on with their business. The history of the inn where the characters spend the night, the mannerisms of the shopkeeper they buy supplies from-you can add this level of detail, but you don't have to. If the characters return to the same settlement, start adding these local features so that it begins to feel a little more like a home base, albeit a temporary one. Let the settlement develop as the need arises.": "定居点可以作为人物停下来休息和购买物资的地方。一个这样的定居点只需要一个简单的描述。包括定居点的名字，决定它有多大，加上一点味道（\"当地制革厂的气味从未从这个镇上散去\"），然后让冒险家们继续他们的生意。人物过夜的旅店的历史，他们购买物资的店主的举止--你可以添加这种程度的细节，但你不必这样做。如果人物回到同一个定居点，就开始添加这些当地的特征，这样它就开始有点像一个大本营了，尽管是临时的。随着需求的出现，让定居点发展起来。",
	"A settlement gives the adventurers a place to live, train, and recuperate between adventures. An entire campaign can center on a particular town or city. Such a settlement is the launching pad from which the characters go out into the wider world.": "定居点为冒险者提供了一个在冒险之间生活、训练和休整的地方。整个活动可以以一个特定的城镇或城市为中心。这样的聚居地是一个发射台，角色们从这里出发，进入更广阔的世界。",

	"To make a home base come alive, you'll need to invest some time fleshing out details, but the players can help you with that work. Ask them to tell you a bit about mentors, family members, and other important people in their characters' lives. Feel free to add to and modify what they give you, but you'll start with a solid foundation of the nonplayer characters (NPCs) who are important to the characters. Let the players describe where and how their characters spend their time—a favorite tavern, library, or temple, perhaps.": "要想让大本营变得生动，你需要投入一些时间来充实细节，但玩家可以帮助你完成这项工作。请他们告诉你一些关于导师、家庭成员和他们角色生活中其他重要人物的情况。你可以自由地补充和修改他们提供的信息，但你要从对角色很重要的非玩家角色（NPCs）的坚实基础开始。让玩家描述他们的角色在哪里以及如何度过他们的时间--也许是最喜欢的小酒馆、图书馆或寺庙。",
	"Using these NPCs and locations as a starting point, flesh out the settlement's cast of characters. Detail its leadership, including law enforcement (discussed later in the chapter). Include characters who can provide information, such as sages, soothsayers, librarians, and observant vagabonds. Priests can provide spellcasting as well as information. Make note of merchants who might regularly interact with the adventurers and perhaps compete with one another for the party's business. Think about the people who run the adventurers' favorite tavern. And then add a handful of wild cards: a shady dealer, a mad prophet, a retired mercenary, a drunken rake, or anyone else who adds a dash of adventure and intrigue to your campaign.": "以这些NPC和地点为起点，充实定居点的人物阵容。详细说明其领导层，包括执法部门（在本章后面讨论）。包括可以提供信息的人物，如圣人、占卜师、图书管理员和观察力强的流浪者。牧师可以提供法术和信息。记下那些可能经常与冒险者打交道的商人，也许他们会为了聚会的生意相互竞争。想一想那些经营冒险者最喜欢的酒馆的人。然后再加上几张野牌：一个阴暗的商人、一个疯狂的预言家、一个退休的雇佣兵、一个醉醺醺的耙子，或者其他任何为你的活动增添冒险和阴谋的人。",

That key element suggests a wealth of sensory details: the sight of colorful boats floating on muddy waters, the sound of lapping waves and perhaps singing gondoliers, the smells of fish and waste polluting the water, the feel of humidity. Or perhaps the city is shrouded in fog much of the time, and you describe the tendrils of cold mist reaching through every crack and cranny, the muffled sounds of hooves on cobblestones, the cold air with the smell of rain, and a sense of mystery and lurking danger.": "也许一个城市是围绕运河而建的，就像现实世界中的威尼斯。这个关键因素暗示了大量的感官细节：五颜六色的船只漂浮在泥泞的水面上的景象，拍打波浪的声音，也许还有贡多拉的歌声，鱼和废物污染水的气味，潮湿的感觉。或者，这个城市大部分时间都笼罩在雾中，而你描述了冷雾的卷轴从每一个缝隙中伸入，马蹄在鹅卵石上发出的闷响，寒冷的空气中弥漫着雨的味道，以及一种神秘感和潜伏的危险。",
	"The climate and terrain of a settlement's environment, its origin and inhabitants, its government and political position, and its commercial importance all have a bearing on its overall atmosphere. A city nestled against the edge of a jungle has a very different feel than one on the edge of a desert. Elf and dwarf cities present a distinct aesthetic, clearly identifiable in contrast to human-built ones. Soldiers patrol the streets to quell any hint of dissent in a city ruled by a tyrant, while a city fostering an early system of democracy might boast an open-air market where philosophical ideas are traded as freely as produce. All the possible combinations of these factors can inspire endless variety in the settlements of your campaign world.": "一个定居点的气候和地形，它的起源和居民，它的政府和政治地位，以及它的商业重要性，都对它的整体氛围有影响。依偎在丛林边缘的城市与位于沙漠边缘的城市有着非常不同的感觉。精灵和矮人的城市呈现出一种独特的美感，与人类建造的城市形成鲜明的对比，清晰可辨。在一个由暴君统治的城市中，士兵们在街上巡逻以平息任何异议，而一个培养早期民主制度的城市可能会拥有一个露天市场，在那里哲学思想可以像农产品一样自由交易。这些因素的所有可能的组合可以激发你的战役世界的定居点的无尽变化。",
	"In the feudal society common in most D&D worlds, power and authority are concentrated in towns and cities. Nobles hold authority over the settlements where they live and the surrounding lands. They collect taxes from the populace, which they use for public building projects, to pay the soldiery, and to support a comfortable lifestyle for themselves (although nobles often have considerable hereditary wealth). In exchange, they promise to protect their citizens from threats such as orc marauders, hobgoblin armies, and roving human bandits.": "在大多数D&D世界中常见的封建社会中，权力和权威都集中在城镇和城市。贵族们对他们所居住的定居点和周围的土地拥有权力。他们向民众征税，用于公共建筑项目，支付士兵的工资，并支持自己的舒适生活（尽管贵族通常拥有相当多的世袭财富）。作为交换，他们承诺保护他们的公民免受威胁，如兽人掠夺者、哥布林军队和游荡的人类土匪。",
	"Nobles appoint officers as their agents in villages, to supervise the collection of taxes and serve as judges in disputes and criminal trials. These reeves, sheriffs, or bailiffs are commoners native to the villages they govern, chosen for their positions because they already hold the respect of their fellow citizens.": "贵族们任命官员作为他们在村庄的代理人，负责监督税收，并在争端和刑事审判中担任法官。这些执法官、治安官或法警都是他们所管辖的村庄的平民，他们被选中担任这些职务是因为他们已经得到了同胞的尊重。",
	"Within towns and cities, lords share authority and administrative responsibility with lesser nobles (usually their own relatives), and also with representatives of the middle class, such as traders and artisans. A lord mayor of noble birth is appointed to head the town or city council and to perform the same administrative functions that reeves carry out in villages. The council consists of representatives elected by the middle class.": "在城镇中，领主与较小的贵族（通常是他们自己的亲属）分享权力和行政责任，也与中产阶级的代表，如商人和工匠分享。一位贵族出身的市长被任命为镇或市议会的领导，并履行与村长在村庄中履行的相同的行政职能。议会由中产阶级选出的代表组成。",
	"Only foolish nobles ignore the wishes of their councils, since the economic power of the middle class is often more important to the prosperity of a town or city than the hereditary authority of the nobility.": "只有愚蠢的贵族才会无视议会的意愿，因为中产阶级的经济实力对一个城镇的繁荣往往比贵族的世袭权力更重要。",
	"The larger a settlement, the more likely that other individuals or organizations hold significant power there as well. Even in a village, a popular individual—a wise elder or a well-liked farmer-can wield more influence than the appointed reeve, and a wise reeve avoids making an enemy of such a person. In towns and cities, the same power might lie in the hands of a prominent temple, a guild independent of the council, or an individual with magical power.": "一个定居点越大，其他个人或组织就越有可能在那里拥有重要的权力。即使在一个村子里，一个受欢迎的人--一个聪明的长者或一个受人欢迎的农民--可以比指定的村长有更大的影响力，一个聪明的村长会避免与这样的人为敌。在城镇，同样的权力可能掌握在一个著名的寺庙、一个独立于议会的行会或一个拥有魔法力量的人手中。",
	"A settlement rarely stands alone. A given town or city might be a theocratic city-state or a prosperous free city governed by a merchant council. More likely, it's part of a feudal kingdom, a bureaucratic empire, or a remote realm ruled by an iron-fisted tyrant. Consider how your settlement fits into the bigger picture of your world or region-who rules its ruler, and what other settlements might also lie under its control.": "一个定居点很少单独存在。一个特定的城镇或城市可能是一个神权城邦或一个由商人委员会管理的繁荣的自由城市。更有可能的是，它是一个封建王国的一部分，一个官僚帝国，或者一个由铁腕暴君统治的偏远地区。考虑你的定居点如何融入你的世界或地区的大局--谁统治着它的统治者，还有哪些其他的定居点可能在它的控制之下。",

	"One hereditary ruler wields absolute power. The autocrat either is supported by a well-developed bureaucracy or military or stands as the only authority in an otherwise anarchic society. The dynastic ruler could be immortal or undead. Aundair and Karrnath, two kingdoms in the Eberron campaign setting, have autocrats with royal blood in their veins. Whereas Queen Aurala of Aundair relies on wizards and spies to enforce her will, Kaius, the vampire king of Karrnath, has a formidable army of living and undead soldiers under his command.": "一个世袭的统治者掌握着绝对的权力。专制者要么得到发达的官僚机构或军队的支持，要么在一个无政府的社会中作为唯一的权威。朝代统治者可能是不朽的或不死的。艾伯伦战役背景中的两个王国--昂代尔（Aundair）和卡尔纳特（Karrnath），都有流淌着王室血统的专制者。昂代尔的奥拉拉女王依靠巫师和间谍来执行她的意志，而卡尔纳特的吸血鬼国王凯厄斯则拥有一支由活人和亡灵士兵组成的强大的军队，在他的指挥下。",

	"Each individual city or town within the confederacy governs itself, but all contribute to a league or federation that promotes (at least in theory) the common good of all member states. Conditions and attitudes toward the central government vary from place to place within the confederacy. The Lords' Alliance in the Forgotten Realms setting is a loose confederacy of cities, while the Mror Holds in the Eberron campaign setting is a confederacy of allied dwarf clans.": "邦联内的每个城市或城镇都自行管理，但都为一个联盟或联合会做出贡献，以促进（至少在理论上）所有成员国的共同利益。邦联内不同地方的条件和对中央政府的态度都不一样。在《被遗忘的领域》的设定中，领主联盟是一个松散的城市联盟，而在Eberron战役的设定中，Moror Holds是一个由矮人部族联盟组成的联盟。",

	"The typical government of Europe in the Middle Ages, a feudalistic society consists of layers of lords and vassals. The vassals provide soldiers or scutage (payment in lieu of military service) to the lords, who in turn promise protection to their vassals.": "作为中世纪欧洲的典型政府，封建社会由一层层的领主和附庸组成。诸侯向领主提供士兵或 \"杂费\"（代替兵役的报酬），而领主则向其诸侯承诺提供保护。",

	"A feudal or bureaucratic government where every member, except one, is subordinate to another member. In the Dragonlance campaign setting, the dragon armies of Krynn form a military hierarchy, with the Dragon Highlords as leaders under the dragon queen Takhisis.": "一个封建的或官僚的政府，除了一个人之外，每个成员都隶属于另一个成员。在《龙之谷》的战役设定中，克莱恩的龙族军队形成了一个军事等级制度，龙族高地主是龙后塔克西丝手下的领导者。",
	"This government is composed of groups or individuals primarily seeking wealth for themselves, often at the expense of their subjects. The grasping Bandit Kingdoms in the Greyhawk campaign setting are prime examples. A kingdom run by thieves' guilds would also fall into this category.": "这种政府是由主要为自己寻求财富的团体或个人组成的，往往以牺牲其臣民的利益为代价。格雷霍克（Greyhawk）战役背景中的抓捕型强盗王国就是最好的例子。由盗贼行会管理的王国也属于这种类型。",

	"This society is governed by the eldest or most important members of one gender. Drow cities are examples of theocratic matriarchies, for each is ruled by a council of drow high priestesses who answer to Lolth, the Demon Queen of Spiders.": "这个社会是由一个性别中最年长或最重要的成员来管理的。鸦人的城市是神权母系社会的典范，因为每个城市都由鸦人的大祭司议会统治，她们对蜘蛛的恶魔女王洛尔思负责。",
	"The most intelligent and educated people oversee the society, often with a bureaucracy to handle the day-to-day work of government. In the Forgotten Realms, scholarly monks preside over the fortress-library of Candlekeep, overseen by a master of lore called the Keeper.": "最聪明和受过教育的人监督着这个社会，通常有一个官僚机构来处理政府的日常工作。在《被遗忘的领域》中，学术界的僧侣们主持着烛龙堡的图书馆，由一位被称为守护者的知识大师监督。",
	"Military leaders run the nation under martial law, using the army and other armed forces. A militocracy might be based on an elite group of soldiers, an order of dragon riders, or a league of sea princes. Solamnia, a nation ruled by knights in the Dragonlance campaign setting, falls into this category.": "军事领导人在戒严法下管理国家，使用军队和其他武装力量。一个军事政体可能基于一个精英士兵团体、一个龙骑士团或一个海王联盟。在《龙之谷》的战役设定中，由骑士统治的国家索兰尼亚就属于这个类别。",
	"A single hereditary sovereign wears the crown. Unlike the autocrat, the monarch's powers are limited by law, and the ruler serves as the head of a democracy, feudal state, or militocracy.

	"A small number of absolute rulers share power, possibly dividing the land into districts or provinces under their control, or jointly ruling together.

The Free City of Greyhawk is an oligarchy composed of various faction leaders, with a Lord Mayor as its figurehead.": "少数绝对统治者分享权力，可能将土地划分为他们控制的地区或省份，或者共同统治。一群冒险家共同控制一个国家可能会形成一个寡头政治。灰鹰自由城是一个由各派系领袖组成的寡头政治，由市长大人作为其首脑。",
	"Society is governed by the wealthy. The elite form a ruling council, purchase representation at the court of a figurehead monarch, or rule by default because money is the true power in the realm. Many cities in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting, including Waterdeep and Baldur's Gate, are plutocracies.": "社会是由富人统治的。精英们组成了一个统治委员会，在君主的宫廷中购买代表，或者默认为统治者，因为金钱是这个王国的真正力量。在《被遗忘的王国》战役设定中，许多城市，包括沃特迪普和博德之门，都是财阀制。",
	"Government is entrusted to representatives of an established electorate who rule on behalf of the electors. Any democracy in which only landowners or certain classes can vote could be considered a republic.": "政府被委托给既定选民的代表，他们代表选民进行统治。任何只有地主或某些阶层可以投票的民主制度都可以被认为是共和制。"
