	"It's good to be the dungeon master! Not only do you get to tell fantastic stories about heroes, villains, monsters, and magic, but you also get to create the world in which these stories live. Whether you're running a D&D game already or you think it's something you want to try, this book is for you.": "做地下城主是件好事！你不仅可以讲述关于英雄、恶棍和魔法的奇妙故事，而且还可以创造这些故事的世界。你不仅可以讲述关于英雄、恶棍、怪物和魔法的奇妙故事，而且还可以创造这些故事所处的世界。无论你是已经在经营D&D游戏，还是认为这是一个你想尝试的东西，这本书都是为你准备的。",
	"The {@i Dungeon Master's Guide} assumes that you know the basics of how to play the D&D tabletop roleplaying game. If you haven't played before, the Dungeons & Dragons Starter Set is a great starting point for new players and DMs.": "{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}假设你知道如何玩D&D桌面角色扮演游戏的基本知识。如果你以前没有玩过，《龙与地下城》入门套装是新玩家和DM的一个很好的起点。",
	"This book has two important companions: the Player's Handbook, which contains the rules your players need to create characters and the rules you need to run the game, and the Monster Manual, which contains ready-to use monsters to populate your D&D world.": "本书有两个重要的伙伴：《玩家手册》和《怪物手册》，前者包含玩家创建角色所需的规则和你运行游戏所需的规则，后者包含可随时使用的怪物以填充你的D&D世界。",
	"The Dungeon Master (DM) is the creative force behind a D&D game. The DM creates a world for the other players to explore, and also creates and runs adventures that drive the story. An adventure typically hinges on the successful completion of a quest, and can be as short as a single game session. Longer adventures might embroil players in great conflicts that require multiple game sessions to resolve. When strung together, these adventures form an ongoing {@b campaign.} A D&D campaign can include dozens of adventures and last for months or years.": "地牢管理员（DM）是D&D游戏背后的创造性力量。管理员为其他玩家创造了一个可以探索的世界，同时也创造和运行驱动故事的冒险。一个冒险通常取决于任务的成功完成，可以短至一个游戏会话。较长的冒险可能会使玩家陷入巨大的冲突，需要多个游戏会话来解决。当这些冒险串联在一起时，就形成了一个持续的（%0%）D&D活动可以包括几十个冒险，并持续数月或数年。",
	"A Dungeon Master gets to wear many hats. As the architect of a campaign, the DM creates adventures by placing monsters, traps, and treasures for the other players' characters (the {@b adventurers}) to discover. As a storyteller, the DM helps the other players visualize what's happening around them, improvising when the adventurers do something or go somewhere unexpected. As an actor, the DM plays the roles of the monsters and supporting characters, breathing life into them. And as a referee, the DM interprets the rules and decides when to abide by them and when to change them.": "地牢管理员可以戴上许多帽子。作为活动的设计者，DM通过放置怪物、陷阱和宝物来创造冒险，让其他玩家的角色（%0%）去发现。作为一个讲故事的人，DM帮助其他玩家想象他们周围发生的事情，当冒险者做一些事情或去一些意想不到的地方时，他就会即兴发挥。作为一个演员，DM扮演怪物和配角的角色，为他们注入活力。而作为裁判员，DM解释规则，决定何时遵守规则，何时改变规则。",
	"Inventing, writing, storytelling, improvising, acting, refereeing-every DM handles these roles differently, and you'll probably enjoy some more than others. It helps to remember that Dungeons & Dragons is a hobby, and being the DM should be fun. Focus on the aspects you enjoy and downplay the rest. For example, if you don't like creating your own adventures, you can use published ones. You can also lean on the other players to help you with rules mastery and world-building.": "发明、写作、讲故事、即兴创作、表演、裁判--每个DM处理这些角色的方式都不一样，你可能会比其他人更喜欢一些。记住 \"龙与地下城 \"是一种爱好，做管理员应该是有趣的。专注于你喜欢的方面，淡化其他方面。例如，如果你不喜欢创造你自己的冒险，你可以使用已出版的冒险。你也可以依靠其他玩家来帮助你掌握规则和构建世界。",
	"The D&D rules help you and the other players have a good time, but the rules aren't in charge. You're the DM, and you are in charge of the game. That said, your goal isn't to slaughter the adventurers but to create a campaign world that revolves around their actions and decisions, and to keep your players coming back for more! If you're lucky, the events of your campaign will echo in the memories of your players long after the final game session is concluded.": "D&D规则帮助你和其他玩家度过一段美好的时光，但规则并不负责任。你是管理员，你负责游戏的进行。也就是说，你的目标不是屠杀冒险者，而是创造一个围绕着他们的行动和决定的活动世界，并让你的玩家不断地回来找寻更多的东西 如果你运气好的话，你的战役事件在最后的游戏环节结束后还会在玩家的记忆中久久回荡。",
	"This book is organized in three parts. The first part helps you decide what kind of campaign you'd like to run. The second part helps you create the adventures-the stories-that will compose the campaign and keep the players entertained from one game session to the next. The last part helps you adjudicate the rules of the game and modify them to suit the style of your campaign.": "本书分为三部分。第一部分帮助你决定你想开展什么样的活动。第二部分帮助你创造冒险--故事--这些故事将构成竞选活动，使玩家从一个游戏环节到另一个游戏环节都能得到乐趣。最后一部分帮助你决定游戏规则，并修改它们以适应你的活动风格。",
	"Every DM is the creator of his or her own campaign world. Whether you invent a world, adapt a world from a favorite movie or novel, or use a published setting for the D&D game, you make that world your own over the course of a campaign.": "每个管理人都是他或她自己活动世界的创造者。无论你是发明了一个世界，还是从最喜欢的电影或小说中改编了一个世界，或者使用已出版的D&D游戏设定，你都会在活动过程中把这个世界变成你自己的。",
	"The world where you set your campaign is one of countless worlds that make up the D&D {@b multiverse}, a vast array of planes and worlds where adventures happen. Even if you're using an established world such as the Forgotten Realms, your campaign takes place in a sort of mirror universe of the official setting where Forgotten Realms novels, game products, and digital games are assumed to take place. The world is yours to change as you see fit and yours to modify as you explore the consequences of the players' actions.": "你设定竞选活动的世界是构成D&D{@b multiverse}的无数世界之一，是一系列冒险发生的星球和世界。即使你使用的是一个既定的世界，比如被遗忘的领域，你的活动也是发生在一种官方设定的镜像宇宙中，被遗忘的领域的小说、游戏产品和数字游戏都被认为是发生在这里。这个世界是你的，你可以根据自己的需要来改变，你可以在探索玩家行为的后果时对其进行修改。",
	"Your world is more than just a backdrop for adventures. Like Middle Earth, Westeros, and countless other fantasy worlds out there, it's a place to which you can escape and witness fantastic stories unfold. A well-designed and well-run world seems to flow around the adventurers, so that they feel part of something, instead of apart from it.": "你的世界不仅仅是一个冒险的背景。就像中土世界、维斯特洛和其他无数的幻想世界一样，它是一个你可以逃避并见证奇妙故事展开的地方。一个设计良好、运行良好的世界似乎围绕着冒险者流动，使他们感到自己是某些东西的一部分，而不是与它分离。",
	"Consistency is a key to a believable fictional world. When the adventurers go back into town for supplies, they should encounter the same {@b nonplayer characters} (NPCs) they met before. Soon, they'll learn the barkeep's name, and he or she will remember theirs as well. Once you have achieved this degree of consistency, you can provide an occasional change. If the adventurers come back to buy more horses at the stables, they might discover that the man who ran the place went back home to the large city over the hills, and now his niece runs the family business. That sort of change-one that has nothing to do with the adventurers directly, but one that they'll notice-makes the players feel as though their characters are part of a living world that changes and grows along with them.": "一致性是一个可信的虚构世界的关键。当冒险家们回到镇上购买补给品时，他们应该会遇到之前遇到的那些（%0%）（NPC）。很快，他们就会知道酒吧老板的名字，而他或她也会记住他们的名字。一旦你达到了这种程度的一致性，你就可以提供一个偶尔的变化。如果冒险者回来在马厩里买更多的马，他们可能会发现经营这个地方的人回到了山那边的大城市，现在他的侄女在经营家族生意。这种变化--与冒险者没有直接关系，但他们会注意到--使玩家感到他们的角色是一个活生生的世界的一部分，这个世界与他们一起变化和成长。",
	"Part 1 of this book is all about inventing your world. Chapter 1 asks what type of game you want to run, and helps you nail down a few important details about your world and its overarching conflicts. Chapter 2 helps you put your world in the greater context of the multiverse, expanding on the information presented in the {@i Player's Handbook} to discuss the planes of existence and the gods and how you can put them together to serve the needs of your campaign.": "本书的第一部分是关于发明你的世界。第1章问你想运行什么类型的游戏，并帮助你确定关于你的世界和其总体冲突的一些重要细节。第2章帮助你把你的世界放在多元宇宙的大背景下，在{@i Player's Handbook}中介绍的信息的基础上扩展，讨论存在平面和诸神，以及你如何把它们放在一起以满足你的活动的需要。",
	"Whether you write your own adventures or use published ones, expect to invest preparation time beyond the hours you spend at the gaming table. You'll need to carve out some free time to exercise your creativity as you invent compelling plots, create new NPCs, craft encounters, and think of clever ways to foreshadow story events yet to come.": "无论你是自己写冒险故事还是使用已出版的冒险故事，都需要投入准备时间，而不是在游戏桌前花费的时间。你需要抽出一些空闲时间来锻炼你的创造力，因为你要发明引人注目的情节，创造新的NPC，制作遭遇战，并想出巧妙的方法来预示即将发生的故事。",
	"Part 2 of this book is devoted to helping you create and run great adventures. Chapter 3 covers the basic elements of a D&D adventure, and chapter 4 helps you create memorable NPCs. Chapter 5 presents guidelines and advice for running adventures set in dungeons, the wilderness, and other locales, and chapter 6 covers the time between adventures. Chapter 7 is all about treasure, magic items, and special rewards that help keep the players invested in your campaign.": "本书的第二部分致力于帮助你创建和运行伟大的冒险。第3章介绍了D&D冒险的基本要素，第4章帮助你创建令人难忘的NPC。第5章介绍了在地下城、荒野和其他地方进行冒险的指南和建议，第6章涉及冒险之间的时间。第7章是关于宝藏、魔法物品和特殊奖励的内容，这些都有助于让玩家投入到你的活动中。",
	"Dungeons & Dragons isn't a head-to-head competition, but it needs someone who is impartial yet involved in the game to guarantee that everyone at the table plays by the rules. As the player who creates the game world and the adventures that take place within it, the DM is a natural fit to take on the referee role.": "龙与地下城并不是一场头对头的比赛，但它需要一个公正而又参与游戏的人，以保证桌子上的每个人都按规则行事。作为创造游戏世界和发生在其中的冒险的玩家，管理员自然适合担任裁判员的角色。",
	"As a referee, the DM acts as a mediator between the rules and the players. A player tells the DM what he or she wants to do, and the DM determines whether it is successful or not, in some cases asking the player to make a die roll to determine success. For example, if a player wants his or her character to take a swing at an orc, you say, \"Make an attack roll\" while looking up the orc's Armor Class.": "作为裁判员，DM在规则和玩家之间充当调解人。玩家告诉管理员他或她想做什么，而管理员则决定是否成功，在某些情况下，要求玩家进行掷骰子来决定是否成功。例如，如果玩家想让他或她的角色向一个兽人挥拳，你就说：\"做一个攻击卷\"，同时查一下兽人的装甲等级。",
	"The rules don't account for every possible situation that might arise during a typical D&D session. For example, a player might want his or her character to hurl a brazier full of hot coals into a monster's face. How you determine the outcome of this action is up to you. You might tell the player to make a Strength check, while mentally setting the {@b Difficulty Class} (DC) at 15. If the Strength check is successful, you then determine how a face full of hot coals affects the monster. You might decide that it deals {@dice 1d4} fire damage and imposes disadvantage on the monster's attack rolls until the end of its next turn. You roll the damage die (or let the player do it), and the game continues.": "这些规则并没有考虑到典型的D&D会议中可能出现的每一种情况。例如，玩家可能想让他或她的角色把一个装满热煤的火炉扔到怪物的脸上。如何决定这一行动的结果由你决定。你可以告诉玩家进行力量检查，同时在心理上将（%0%）（DC）设定为15。如果力量检查成功，你就会决定满脸的热煤对怪物的影响。你可以决定它造成{@dice 1d4}的火焰伤害，并对怪物的攻击卷轴施加不利因素，直到它的下一回合结束。你掷出伤害模子（或让玩家掷出），然后游戏继续。",
	"Sometimes mediating the rules means setting limits. If a player tells you, \"I want to run up and attack the orc,\" but the character doesn't have enough movement to reach the orc, you say, \"It's too far away to move up and still attack. What would you like to do instead?\" The player takes the information and comes up with a different plan.": "有时调解规则意味着设定限制。如果一个玩家告诉你，\"我想跑上去攻击那个兽人\"，但是角色没有足够的移动能力去接触那个兽人，你就说，\"它太远了，无法移动，而且还能攻击。你想怎么做呢？\" 玩家接受了这些信息，想出了一个不同的计划。",
	"To referee the rules, you need to know them. You don't have to memorize this book or the Player's Handbook, but you should have a clear idea of their contents so that, when a situation requires a ruling, you know where to find the proper reference.": "要做裁判，你需要了解这些规则。你不必记住这本书或玩家手册，但你应该对它们的内容有一个清晰的概念，这样，当有情况需要裁决时，你就知道在哪里可以找到适当的参考。",
	"The Player's Handbook contains the main rules you need to play the game. Part 3 of this book offers a wealth of information to help you adjudicate the rules in a wide variety of situations. Chapter 8 presents advice for using attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. It also includes options appropriate for certain play styles and campaigns, including guidelines for using miniatures, a system for handling chase scenes, and rules for madness. If you like to create your own stuff, such as new monsters, races, and character backgrounds, chapter 9 shows you how. That chapter also contains optional rules for unusual situations or play styles, such as the use of firearms in a fantasy setting.": "玩家手册》包含了你玩游戏所需的主要规则。本书第三部分提供了丰富的信息，帮助你在各种情况下对规则进行裁决。第8章介绍了使用攻击卷、能力检查和蓄力的建议。它还包括适合某些游戏风格和活动的选项，包括使用微型模型的指南、处理追逐场景的系统和疯狂规则。如果你喜欢创造自己的东西，比如新的怪物、种族和角色背景，第9章会告诉你如何做。这一章还包含了针对不寻常情况或玩法的可选规则，如在奇幻环境中使用枪支。",
	"The success of a D&D game hinges on your ability to entertain the other players at the game table. Whereas their role is to create characters (the protagonists of the campaign), breathe life into them, and help steer the campaign through their characters' actions, your role is to keep the players (and yourself) interested and immersed in the world you've created, and to let their characters do awesome things.": "D&D游戏的成功取决于你在游戏桌上招待其他玩家的能力。他们的作用是创造角色（活动的主角），为他们注入生命，并通过他们的角色行动来帮助引导活动，而你的作用是让玩家（和你自己）感兴趣并沉浸在你创造的世界中，并让他们的角色做一些了不起的事情。",
	"Knowing what your players enjoy most about the D&D game helps you create and run adventures that they will enjoy and remember. Once you know which of the following activities each player in your group enjoys the most, you can tailor adventures that satisfy your players' preferences as much as possible, thus keeping them engaged.": "了解你的玩家在D&D游戏中最喜欢什么，有助于你创建和运行他们会喜欢并记住的冒险。一旦你知道你的小组中的每个玩家最喜欢以下哪种活动，你就可以定制尽可能满足玩家喜好的冒险，从而保持他们的参与。",
	"Players who enjoy acting like getting into character and speaking in their characters' voices. Roleplayers at heart, they enjoy social interactions with NPCs, monsters, and their fellow party members.": "喜欢演戏的玩家，比如进入角色，用角色的声音说话。他们是内心深处的角色扮演者，喜欢与NPC、怪物和他们的同伴进行社交互动。",

	"This book, the {@i Player's Handbook}, and the {@i Monster Manual} present the default assumptions for how the worlds of D&D work. Among the established settings of D&D, the Forgotten Realms, Greyhawk, Dragonlance, and Mystara don't stray very far from those assumptions. Settings such as Dark Sun, Eberron, Ravenloft, Spelljammer, and Planescape venture further away from that baseline. As you create your own world, it's up to you to decide where on the spectrum you want your world to fall.": "本书、{@i Player's Handbook}和{@i Monster Manual}提出了D&D世界如何运作的默认假设。在D&D的既定设定中，被遗忘的王国（Forgotten Realms）、灰鹰（Greyhawk）、龙之谷（Dragonlance）和秘境（Mystara）并没有偏离这些假设的范围。黑暗太阳、Eberron、Ravenloft、Spelljammer和Planescape等设定则进一步偏离了这一基线。当你创造你自己的世界时，你要决定你想让你的世界落在什么位置。",

	"The gods are real and embody a variety of beliefs, with each god claiming dominion over an aspect of the world, such as war, forests, or the sea. Gods exert influence over the world by granting divine magic to their followers and sending signs and portents to guide them. The follower of a god serves as an agent of that god in the world. The agent seeks to further the ideals of that god and defeat its rivals. While some folk might refuse to honor the gods, none can deny their existence.": "神是真实存在的，体现了各种信仰，每个神都声称对世界的某个方面有统治权，如战争、森林或海洋。众神通过向其追随者授予神圣的魔法，并发送征兆和预兆来引导他们，从而对世界施加影响。一个神的追随者作为该神在这个世界上的代理人。代理人寻求推进该神的理想并击败其对手。虽然有些人可能拒绝尊重神灵，但没有人能够否认他们的存在。",
	"Wild regions abound. City-states, confederacies, and kingdoms of various sizes dot the landscape, but beyond their borders the wilds crowd in. People know the area they live in well. They've heard stories of other places from merchants and travelers, but few know what lies beyond the mountains or in the depths of the great forest unless they've been there themselves.": "野生地区比比皆是。大大小小的城邦、邦联和王国点缀着这片土地，但在它们的边界之外，荒野拥挤不堪。人们对自己居住的地区非常了解。他们从商人和旅行者那里听说过其他地方的故事，但很少有人知道山外或大森林深处有什么，除非他们亲自去过那里。",
	"Empires rise and fall, leaving few places that have not been touched by imperial grandeur or decay. War, time, and natural forces eventually claim the mortal world, leaving it rich with places of adventure and mystery. Ancient civilizations and their knowledge survive in legends, magic items, and their ruins. Chaos and evil often follow an empire's collapse.": "帝国兴衰，很少有地方没有被帝国的宏伟或衰败所触动。战争、时间和自然力量最终夺走了凡人的世界，留下了丰富的冒险和神秘的地方。古代文明和他们的知识在传说、魔法物品和他们的废墟中幸存下来。混乱和邪恶往往伴随着一个帝国的崩溃。",
	"Powerful individuals strive to make their mark on the world, and factions of like-minded individuals can alter the course of history. Factions include religions led by charismatic prophets, kingdoms ruled by lasting dynasties, and shadowy societies that seek to master long-lost magic. The influence of such factions waxes and wanes as they compete with each other for power. Some seek to preserve the world and usher in a golden age. Others strive toward evil ends, seeking to rule the world with an iron fist. Still others seek goals that range from the practical to the esoteric, such as the accumulation of material wealth or the resurrection of a dead god. Whatever their goals, these factions inevitably collide, creating conflict that can steer the world's fate.": "有权势的人努力在这个世界上留下自己的印记，而志同道合的人组成的派别可以改变历史的进程。派别包括由有魅力的先知领导的宗教，由持久的王朝统治的王国，以及寻求掌握失传已久的魔法的阴暗社会。这些派别的影响力随着他们之间的权力竞争而消长。一些人寻求保护世界，迎来一个黄金时代。其他人则努力实现邪恶的目的，寻求用铁拳统治世界。还有一些人寻求从实用到深奥的目标，如积累物质财富或复活死去的神。无论他们的目标是什么，这些派别都不可避免地发生碰撞，产生冲突，从而引导世界的命运。",
	"Practitioners of magic are relatively few in number, but they leave evidence of their craft everywhere. The magic can be as innocuous and commonplace as a potion that heals wounds to something much more rare and impressive, such as a levitating tower or a stone golem guarding the gates of a city. Beyond the realms of civilization are caches of magic items guarded by magic traps, as well as magically constructed dungeons inhabited by monsters created by magic, cursed by magic, or endowed with magical abilities.": "魔法从业者的数量相对较少，但他们到处都留下了他们技艺的证据。这些魔法可以是无害的、普通的，如治疗伤口的药水，也可以是更罕见的、令人印象深刻的东西，如浮空塔或守卫城市大门的石雕。在文明的领域之外，还有由魔法陷阱守护的魔法物品库，以及由魔法创造的怪物、被魔法诅咒的怪物或被赋予魔法能力的怪物居住的魔法建造的地牢。",
	"In creating your campaign world, it helps to start with the core assumptions and consider how your setting might change them. The subsequent sections of this chapter address each element and give details on how to flesh out your world with gods, factions, and so forth. The assumptions sketched out above aren't carved in stone. They inspire exciting D&D worlds full of adventure, but they're not the only set of assumptions that can do so. You can build an interesting campaign concept by altering one or more of those core assumptions, just as well-established D&D worlds have done. Ask yourself, \"What if the standard assumptions weren't true in my world?\"": "在创建你的活动世界时，从核心假设开始，并考虑你的设定会如何改变它们，这是有帮助的。本章的后续章节将讨论每个要素，并详细介绍如何用神灵、派别等来充实你的世界。上面勾勒的假设并不是刻在石头上的。它们激发了令人兴奋的、充满冒险的D&D世界，但它们并不是唯一能够做到这一点的一套假设。你可以通过改变这些核心假设中的一个或多个来建立一个有趣的活动概念，就像成熟的D&D世界所做的那样。问问自己，\"如果标准的假设在我的世界里不是真的呢？\"",
	"What if magic is rare and dangerous, and even adventurers have limited or no access to it? What if your campaign is set in a version of our own world's history?": "如果魔法是罕见的、危险的，甚至冒险者也只能有限地或根本无法获得它，那该怎么办？如果你的活动设定在我们自己世界的历史版本中呢？",
	"What if your world is new, and the characters are the first of a long line of heroes? The adventurers might be champions of the first great empires, such as the empires of Netheril and Cormanthor in the Forgotten Realms setting.": "如果你的世界是新的，而角色是一长串英雄中的第一个呢？冒险家们可能是第一个伟大帝国的冠军，比如被遗忘的领域中的尼瑟尔和科曼托帝国。",
	"What if the world is completely charted and mapped, right down to the \"Here there be dragons\" notations? What if great empires cover huge stretches of countryside, with clearly defined borders between them? The Five Nations of the Eberron setting were once part of a great empire, and magically aided travel between its cities is commonplace.": "如果世界完全被绘制成地图，甚至包括 \"这里有龙 \"的标记，那会怎样？如果伟大的帝国覆盖了大片的乡村，它们之间有明确的边界，那会怎样？Eberron设定中的五国曾经是一个大帝国的一部分，在其城市之间进行魔法辅助的旅行是很常见的。",
	"What if monsters are rare and terrifying? In the Ravenloft setting, horrific domains are governed by monstrous rulers. The populace lives in perpetual terror of these darklords and their evil minions, but other monsters rarely trouble people's daily lives.": "如果怪兽是罕见的、可怕的呢？在《雷文洛夫特》的设定中，可怕的领地由畸形的统治者统治着。民众永远生活在对这些黑暗统治者及其邪恶爪牙的恐惧之中，但其他怪物却很少困扰人们的日常生活。",
	"What if every town is ruled by a powerful wizard? What if magic item shops are common? The Eberron setting makes the use of magic an everyday occurrence, as magical flying ships and trains carry travelers from one great city to another.": "如果每个城镇都被一个强大的巫师所统治呢？如果魔法物品商店很常见呢？Eberron的设定使魔法的使用成为一种日常现象，因为神奇的飞船和火车将旅行者从一个大城市带到另一个城市。",
	"What if the gods regularly walk the earth? What if the characters can challenge them and seize their power? Or what if the gods are remote, and even angels never make contact with mortals? In the Dark Sun setting, the gods are extremely distant-perhaps nonexistent-and clerics rely instead on elemental power for their magic.": "如果诸神定期在地球上行走呢？如果人物可以挑战他们并夺取他们的权力呢？或者，如果诸神很遥远，甚至天使也从不与凡人接触呢？在黑暗太阳的设定中，诸神非常遥远--也许是不存在的--而神职人员的魔法则依赖于元素的力量。",
	"Appendix B of the Player's Handbook presents a number of pantheons (loose groupings of deities not united by a single doctrine or philosophy) for use in your game, including the gods of established D&D worlds and fantasy-historical pantheons. You can adopt one of these pantheons for your campaign, or pick and choose deities and ideas from them as you please. See \"A Sample Pantheon\" in this section for an example. As far as the game's rules are concerned, it doesn't matter if your world has hundreds of deities or a church devoted to a single god. In rules terms, clerics choose domains, not deities, so your world can associate domains with deities in any way you choose.": "玩家手册》的附录B介绍了一些供你在游戏中使用的万神殿（不是由单一教义或哲学统一的松散的神灵组合），包括既定的D&D世界的神灵和幻想历史中的万神殿。你可以在你的活动中采用这些万神殿中的一个，也可以根据你的意愿从中挑选神灵和想法。请参阅本节中的 \"万神殿样本\"，了解一个例子。就游戏规则而言，如果你的世界有成百上千的神灵，或者只有一个教堂专门供奉一个神，这并不重要。在规则方面，牧师选择领域，而不是神灵，所以你的世界可以以任何你选择的方式将领域与神灵联系起来。",
	"Most D&D worlds have a loose pantheon of gods. A multitude of deities rule the various aspects of existence, variously cooperating with and competing against one another to administer the affairs of the universe. People gather in public shrines to worship gods of life and wisdom, or meet in hidden places to venerate gods of deception or destruction. Each deity in a pantheon has a portfolio and is responsible for advancing that portfolio. In the Greyhawk setting, Heironeous is a god of valor who calls clerics and paladins to his service and encourages them to spread the ideals of honorable warfare, chivalry, and justice in society. Even in the midst of his everlasting war with his brother Hextor, god of war and tyranny, Heironeous promotes his own portfolio: war fought nobly and in the cause of justice.": "大多数D&D世界都有一个松散的众神殿。众多的神灵统治着存在的各个方面，在管理宇宙事务时，他们相互合作或相互竞争。人们聚集在公共神殿中崇拜生命和智慧之神，或者在隐秘的地方聚会，敬仰欺骗或破坏之神。万神殿中的每个神灵都有一个组合，并负责推进该组合。在灰鹰的设定中，Heironeous是一位英勇之神，他召唤牧师和圣骑士为他服务，鼓励他们在社会上传播光荣的战争、骑士精神和正义的理想。即使在他与他的兄弟--战争和暴政之神海克斯托（Hextor）的永恒战争中，Heironeous也在宣传他自己的组合：为了正义而高尚地进行战争。",
	"People in most D&D worlds are polytheistic, honoring deities of their own and acknowledging pantheons of other cultures. Individuals pay homage to various gods, regardless of alignment. In the Forgotten Realms, a person might propitiate Umberlee before setting out to sea, join a communal feast to celebrate Chauntea at harvest time, and pray to Malar before going hunting.": "大多数D&D世界的人们都是多神论者，他们尊敬自己的神灵，也承认其他文化的万神殿。个人向不同的神灵致敬，而不考虑他们的取向。在被遗忘的领域，一个人可能会在出海前祭拜Umberlee，在收获季节参加庆祝Chauntea的集体宴会，并在打猎前向Malar祈祷。",
	"Some individuals feel a calling to a particular deity's service and claim that god as a patron. Particularly devoted individuals become priests by setting up a shrine or helping to staff a holy site. Much more rarely, those who feel such a calling become clerics or paladins invested with the responsibility of true divine power.": "有些人感到被召唤去为某一特定的神灵服务，并称该神为守护神。特别虔诚的人通过建立神龛或帮助圣地的工作人员成为牧师。更罕见的是，那些感受到这种召唤的人成为牧师或圣骑士，被赋予真正的神力的责任。",
	"Shrines and temples serve as community gathering points for religious rites and festivals. Priests at such sites relate stories of the gods, teach the ethics of their patron deities, offer advice and blessings, perform religious rites, and provide training in activities their deities favor. Cities and large towns can host several temples dedicated to individual gods important to the community, while smaller settlements might have a single shrine devoted to any gods the locals revere.": "祠堂和庙宇是社区宗教仪式和节日的聚集点。这些地方的祭司讲述神的故事，传授他们的守护神的道德观，提供建议和祝福，举行宗教仪式，并在他们的神灵所喜爱的活动中提供培训。城市和大城镇可以有几座寺庙，专门供奉对社区很重要的个别神灵，而较小的定居点可能有一座神龛，专门供奉当地人崇敬的任何神灵。",
	"To quickly build a pantheon for your world, create a single god for each of the eight domains available to clerics: Death, Knowledge, Life, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery, and War. You can invent names and personalities for these deities, or borrow deities from other pantheons. This approach gives you a small pantheon that covers the most significant aspects of existence, and it's easy enough to extrapolate other areas of life each deity controls. The god of Knowledge, for example, might also be patron of magic and prophecy, while the god of Light could be the sun god and the god of time.": "为了迅速为你的世界建立一个万神殿，为神职人员可用的八个领域各创建一个神。死亡、知识、生命、光明、自然、暴风雨、诡计和战争。你可以为这些神灵发明名字和个性，或者从其他神殿借用神灵。这种方法为你提供了一个小型万神殿，涵盖了存在的最重要方面，而且很容易推断出每个神灵控制的其他生活领域。例如，知识之神也可能是魔法和预言的守护神，而光明之神可能是太阳神和时间之神。",
	"The pantheon of the Dawn War is an example of a pantheon assembled from mostly preexisting elements to suit the needs of a particular campaign. This is the default pantheon in the fourth edition {@i Player's Handbook (2008)}. The pantheon is summarized in the Dawn War Deities table.": "黎明之战的万神殿是一个例子，它是由大部分预先存在的元素组成的万神殿，以适应特定活动的需要。这是第四版中的默认万神殿（%0%）。该万神殿在 \"黎明之战神祗表 \"中进行了总结。",
	"This pantheon draws in several nonhuman deities and establishes them as universal gods. These gods include Bahamut, Corellon, Gruumsh, Lolth, Moradin, Sehanine, and Tiamat. Humans worship Moradin and Corellon as gods of their respective portfolios, rather than as racial deities. The pantheon also includes the archdevil Asmodeus as god of domination and tyranny.": "这个万神殿吸纳了几个非人类的神灵，并将他们确立为普遍的神灵。这些神包括巴哈姆特（Bahamut）、科瑞隆（Corellon）、格鲁姆什（Gruumsh）、洛特（Lolth）、莫拉丁（Moradin）、塞哈宁（Sehanine）和提亚马特（Tiamat）。人类将莫拉丁和科雷隆作为他们各自组合的神灵来崇拜，而不是作为种族神灵。万神殿还包括作为统治和暴政之神的大恶魔阿斯莫德。",
	"Several of the gods are drawn from other pantheons, sometimes with new names for the gods. Bane comes from the Forgotten Realms. From Greyhawk come Kord, Pelor, Tharizdun, and Vecna. From the Greek pantheon come Athena (renamed Erathis) and Tyche (renamed Avandra), though both are altered. Set (renamed Zehir) comes from the Egyptian pantheon. The Raven Queen is akin to the Norse pantheon's Hel and Greyhawk's Wee Jas. That leaves three gods created from scratch: Ioun, Melora, and Torog.": "有几位神灵来自其他万神殿，有时还为神灵取了新的名字。班恩来自被遗忘的领域。灰鹰（Greyhawk）的科德（Kord）、佩罗（Pelor）、塔里兹顿（Tharizdun）和维克纳（Vecna）。希腊万神殿的雅典娜（改名为Erathis）和泰切（改名为Avandra），尽管两者都被改变了。Set（改名为Zehir）来自埃及的万神殿。乌鸦女王类似于北欧万神殿的赫尔和灰鹰城的韦亚斯。这就留下了三个从头开始创造的神。伊翁、梅罗拉和托罗格。",

	"In contrast to a loose pantheon, a tight pantheon focuses on a single religion whose teachings and edicts embrace a small group of deities. Followers of a tight pantheon might favor one of its member deities over another, but they respect all the deities and honor them with sacrifices and prayer as appropriate.": "与松散的万神殿相反，严密的万神殿专注于一个单一的宗教，其教义和法令包括一小群神灵。严密万神殿的追随者可能会偏爱其中一个成员的神灵，但他们尊重所有的神灵，并在适当的时候用祭品和祈祷向他们致敬。",
	"The key trait to a tight pantheon is that its worshipers embrace a single ethos or dogma that includes all the deities. The gods of the tight pantheon work as one to protect and guide their followers. You can think of a tight pantheon as similar to a family. One or two deities who lead the pantheon serve as parent figures, with the rest serving as patrons of important aspects of the culture that worships the pantheon. A single temple honors all members of the pantheon.": "严密万神殿的关键特征是其崇拜者接受一个包括所有神灵的单一精神或教条。严密万神殿的神灵作为一个整体来保护和引导他们的追随者。你可以把严密万神殿想象成类似于一个家庭。一个或两个领导万神殿的神灵作为家长人物，其他神灵作为崇拜万神殿的文化的重要方面的赞助人。一座寺庙就会向万神殿的所有成员致敬。",
	"Most tight pantheons have one or more aberrant gods-deities whose worship isn't sanctioned by the priests of the pantheon as a whole. These are usually evil deities and enemies of the pantheon, such as the Greek Titans. These deities have cults of their own, attracting social outcasts and villains to their worship.": "大多数严密的万神殿都有一个或多个反常的神--其崇拜不被整个万神殿的祭司所认可的神。这些通常是邪恶的神灵和万神殿的敌人，如希腊泰坦。这些神灵有自己的崇拜，吸引着社会上的弃儿和恶棍来崇拜他们。",
	"These cults resemble mystery cults, their members strictly devoted to their single god, though even members of aberrant cults pay lip service in the temples of the tight pantheon.": "这些教派类似于神秘教派，其成员严格献身于他们的单一神灵，尽管即使是反常教派的成员也会在严格的万神殿中进行口头服务。",
	"The Norse deities serve as an example of a tight pantheon. Odin is the pantheon's leader and father figure. Deities such as Thor, Tyr, and Freya embody important aspects of Norse culture. Meanwhile, Loki and his devotees lurk in the shadows, sometimes aiding the other deities, and sometimes working against them with the pantheon's enemies.": "北欧的神灵是一个紧密的万神殿的例子。奥丁是万神殿的领袖和父亲形象。雷神、泰尔和芙蕾雅等神灵体现了北欧文化的重要方面。同时，洛基和他的信徒潜伏在暗处，有时帮助其他神灵，有时与万神殿的敌人一起对抗他们。",
	"A mystery cult is a secretive religious organization based on a ritual of initiation, in which the initiate is mystically identified with a god, or a handful of related gods. Mystery cults are intensely personal, concerned with the initiate's relationship with the divine.": "神秘邪教是一种基于入教仪式的秘密宗教组织，在这种仪式中，入教者被神秘地认同于一个神或少数几个相关的神。神秘邪教是强烈的个人化的，关注入门者与神的关系。",
	"Sometimes a mystery cult is a type of worship within a pantheon. It acknowledges the myths and rituals of the pantheon, but presents its own myths and rites as primary. For instance, a secretive order of monks might immerse themselves in a mystical relationship to a god who is part of a broadly worshiped pantheon.": "有时，神秘崇拜是万神殿内的一种崇拜类型。它承认万神殿的神话和仪式，但把自己的神话和仪式作为主要内容。例如，一个秘密的僧侣团体可能会将自己沉浸在与一个属于广泛崇拜的万神殿的神的神秘关系中。",
	"A mystery cult emphasizes the history of its god, which is symbolically reenacted in its initiation ritual. The foundation myth of a mystery cult is usually simple and often involves a god's death and rising, or a journey to the underworld and a return. Mystery cults often revere sun and moon deities and agricultural deities—gods whose portfolios reflect the cycles of nature.": "神秘崇拜强调其神的历史，在其入教仪式中象征性地重现了这一历史。神秘崇拜的基础神话通常很简单，通常涉及到一个神的死亡和复活，或一个前往冥界的旅程和返回。神秘崇拜通常崇尚太阳和月亮神以及农业神，这些神的组合反映了自然界的周期。",
	"The cult's ritual of initiation follows the pattern of its foundation myth. Neophytes retrace the god's footsteps in order to share the god's ultimate fate. In the case of dying and rising gods, the symbolic death of the initiate represents the idea of death to the old life and rebirth into a transformed existence. Initiates are born into a new life, remaining in the world of mortal affairs but feeling elevated to a higher sphere. The initiate is promised a place in the god's realm after death, but also experiences new meaning in life.": "该邪教的入教仪式遵循其基础神话的模式。新人追寻神的脚步，以分享神的最终命运。在垂死的神和崛起的神的情况下，入会者的象征性死亡代表了对旧生活的死亡和重生到一个转变的存在的想法。入门者出生在一个新的生活中，留在凡人的世界里，但感觉被提升到一个更高的境界。入门者被许诺死后在神的领域中占有一席之地，但同时也体验到生活的新意义。",
	"The divine beings of the multiverse are often categorized according to their cosmic power. Some gods are worshiped on multiple worlds and have a different rank on each world, depending on their influence there.": "多元宇宙的神灵通常根据其宇宙力量进行分类。有些神灵在多个世界受到崇拜，在每个世界都有不同的等级，这取决于他们在那里的影响力。",
	"{@b Greater deities} are beyond mortal understanding. They can't be summoned, and they are almost always removed from direct involvement in mortal affairs. On very rare occasions they manifest avatars similar to lesser deities, but slaying a greater god's avatar has no effect on the god itself.": "{@b Greater deities}是凡人无法理解的。他们不能被召唤，而且他们几乎总是不直接参与凡人的事务。在非常罕见的情况下，他们会显现出类似于小神的化身，但杀死大神的化身对神本身没有影响。",
	"{@b Lesser deities} are embodied somewhere in the planes. Some lesser deities live in the Material Plane, as does the unicorn-goddess Lurue of the Forgotten Realms and the titanic shark-god Sekolah revered by the sahuagin. Others live on the Outer Planes, as Lolth does in the Abyss. Such deities can be encountered by mortals.": "{@b Lesser deities}都体现在各个位面的某个地方。一些较小的神灵生活在物质界，如被遗忘的领域中的独角兽女神露露和萨瓦金人所敬仰的泰坦鲨鱼神塞科拉。其他人则生活在外部星球上，如深渊中的洛尔思。凡人可以遇到这样的神祗。",
	"{@b Quasi-deities} have a divine origin, but they don't hear or answer prayers, grant spells to clerics, or control aspects of mortal life. They are still immensely powerful beings, and in theory they could ascend to godhood if they amassed enough worshipers. Quasi-deities fall into three subcategories: demigods, titans, and vestiges.": "{@b Quasi-deities}有神圣的起源，但他们不听或不回答祈祷，不授予牧师法术，或控制凡人生活的各个方面。他们仍然是非常强大的生命，理论上，如果他们积累了足够的崇拜者，他们可以升为神。准神分为三个子类别：半神、泰坦和遗迹。",
	"{@i Demigods} are born from the union of a deity and a mortal being. They have some divine attributes, but their mortal parentage makes them the weakest quasi-deities.": "{@i Demigods}是由一个神灵和一个凡人的结合而生。他们有一些神性属性，但他们的凡人父母身份使他们成为最弱的准神。",
	"{@i Titans} are the divine creations of deities. They might be birthed from the union of two deities, manufactured on a divine forge, born from the blood spilled by a god, or otherwise brought about through divine will or substance.": "{@i Titans}是神祗的神圣创造物。他们可能是从两个神灵的结合中诞生的，在一个神圣的锻造厂制造的，从一个神灵的血液中诞生的，或者通过神圣的意志或物质带来的其他方式。",
	"{@i Vestiges} are deities who have lost nearly all their worshipers and are considered dead, from a mortal perspective. Esoteric rituals can sometimes contact these beings and draw on their latent power.": "{@i Vestiges}是那些几乎失去了所有崇拜者的神灵，从凡人的角度来看，他们被认为已经死亡。神秘的仪式有时可以与这些生命接触，汲取他们的潜在力量。",
	"Monotheistic religions revere only one deity, and in some cases, deny the existence of any other deity. If you introduce a monotheistic religion into your campaign, you need to decide whether other gods exist. Even if they don't, other religions can exist side by side with the monotheistic religion. If these religions have clerics with spellcasting ability, their spells might be powered by the one true deity, by lesser spirits who aren't deities (possibly including powerful aberrations, celestials, fey, fiends, or elementals), or simply by their faith.": "一神教只敬重一个神，在某些情况下，否认任何其他神的存在。如果你在你的战役中引入了一神教，你需要决定其他神是否存在。即使它们不存在，其他宗教也可以与一神教并存。如果这些宗教有具有法术能力的牧师，他们的法术可能是由唯一的真神、不是神的较小的精神（可能包括强大的反常者、天人、妖怪、魔人或元素），或者仅仅是由他们的信仰提供的。",
	"The deity of a monotheistic religion has an extensive portfolio and is portrayed as the creator of everything, in control of everything, and concerned with every aspect of existence. Thus, a worshiper of this god offers prayers and sacrifices to the same god regardless of what aspect of life is in need of divine assistance. Whether marching into war, setting off on a journey, or hoping to win someone's affections, the worshiper prays to the same god.": "一神教的神灵有广泛的组合，被描绘成万物的创造者，控制着一切，关注着生存的每一个方面。因此，这种神的崇拜者无论在生活的哪个方面需要神的帮助，都要向同一个神祈祷和献祭。无论是行军打仗，还是出发旅行，或者希望赢得某人的感情，崇拜者都向同一个神祈祷。",
	"Some monotheistic religions describe different aspects of their deity. A single god appears in different aspects as the Creator and the Destroyer, and the clerics of that god focus on one aspect or the other, determining their domain access and possibly even their alignment on that basis. A cleric who venerates the Destroyer aspect chooses the Tempest or War domain, while one who worships a Creator aspect chooses the Life or Nature domains. In some monotheistic religions, clerics group themselves into distinct religious orders to differentiate clerics who choose different domains.": "一些一神教描述了他们神灵的不同方面。一个单一的神在不同的方面出现，如创造者和毁灭者，该神的神职人员专注于一个方面或另一个方面，在此基础上决定他们的领域权限，甚至可能是他们的排列。崇拜毁灭者的神职人员选择暴风雨或战争领域，而崇拜创造者的神职人员则选择生命或自然领域。在一些一神教中，教士们将自己分成不同的宗教团体，以区分选择不同领域的教士。",
	"A dualistic religion views the world as the stage for a conflict between two diametrically opposed deities or divine forces. Most often, the opposed forces are good and evil, or opposed deities representing those forces. In some pantheons, the forces or deities of law and chaos are the fundamental opposites in a dualistic system. Life and death, light and darkness, matter and spirit, body and mind, health and illness, purity and defilement, positive energy and negative energy-the D&D universe is full of polar opposites that could serve as the foundation for a dualistic religion. Whatever the terms in which the dualism is expressed, half of the pair is usually believed to be good-beneficial, desirable, or holy-while the other half is considered bad, if not explicitly evil. If the fundamental conflict in a religion is expressed as the opposition between matter and spirit, the followers of that religion believe that one of the two (usually matter) is evil and the other (spirit) is good, and so seek to liberate their spirits from this material world and its evils through asceticism and contemplation.": "二元论宗教认为世界是两个截然相反的神灵或神性力量之间的冲突舞台。大多数情况下，对立的力量是善与恶，或代表这些力量的对立神灵。在一些万神殿中，法律和混乱的力量或神灵是二元体系中的基本对立面。生命与死亡、光明与黑暗、物质与精神、身体与心灵、健康与疾病、纯洁与污秽、正能量与负能量--D&D宇宙充满了两极对立，可以作为二元论宗教的基础。无论二元论以何种方式表达，这对二元论的一半通常被认为是好的--有益的、可取的或神圣的，而另一半则被认为是坏的，如果不是明确的邪恶。如果一个宗教的基本冲突被表述为物质和精神的对立，那么该宗教的信徒就认为两者中的一个（通常是物质）是邪恶的，另一个（精神）是好的，因此寻求通过禁欲主义和沉思将他们的精神从这个物质世界及其邪恶中解放出来。",
	"Rare dualistic systems believe that the two opposing forces must remain in balance, always pulling away from each other but remaining bound together in creative tension.": "罕见的二元论系统认为，两种对立的力量必须保持平衡，总是相互拉开距离，但在创造性的张力中保持结合。",
	"In a cosmology defined by an eternal conflict between good and evil, mortals are expected to take sides. The majority of those who follow a dualistic religion worship the deity or force identified as good. Worshipers of the good deity trust themselves to that god's power to protect them from the evil deity's minions. Because the evil deity in such a religion is usually the source of everything that is detrimental to existence, only the perverse and depraved worship this god. Monsters and fiends serve it, as do certain secretive cults. The myths of a dualistic religion usually predict that the good deity will triumph in an apocalyptic battle, but the forces of evil believe that the outcome of that battle isn't predetermined and work to promote their deity's victory.": "在一个由善与恶之间的永恒冲突所定义的宇宙论中，凡人被期望选边站。大多数信奉二元论宗教的人都崇拜被认定为善的神灵或力量。善神的崇拜者相信自己有神的力量来保护他们不受恶神的奴役。因为这种宗教中的邪神通常是一切不利于生存的根源，所以只有变态和堕落的人才会崇拜这个神。怪兽和恶魔为其服务，某些秘密的邪教也是如此。二元论宗教的神话通常预测善神将在世界末日之战中取得胜利，但邪恶势力认为这场战斗的结果并不是预先确定的，并努力促进他们的神的胜利。",
	"Deities in a dualistic system maintain large portfolios. All aspects of existence reflect the dualistic struggle, and therefore all things can fall on one side or the other of the conflict. Agriculture, mercy, the sky, medicine, and poetry reside in the portfolio of the good deity, and famine, hatred, disease, and war belong to the evil deity.": "二元系统中的神灵保持着大量的投资组合。存在的所有方面都反映了二元论的斗争，因此，所有事物都可能落在冲突的一方或另一方。农业、仁慈、天空、医药和诗歌属于善神的组合，而饥荒、仇恨、疾病和战争则属于恶神。",
	"Animism is the belief that spirits inhabit every part of the natural world. In an animistic worldview, everything has a spirit, from the grandest mountain to the lowliest rock, from the great ocean to a babbling brook, from the sun and moon to a fighter's ancestral sword. All these objects, and the spirits that inhabit them, are sentient, though some are more aware, alert, and intelligent than others. The most powerful spirits might even be considered deities. All are worthy of respect if not veneration.": "万物有灵论是一种信仰，认为自然界的每一部分都有灵。在万物有灵论的世界观中，一切都有灵，从最宏伟的山峰到最低矮的岩石，从巨大的海洋到潺潺的小溪，从太阳和月亮到战士的祖先之剑。所有这些物体，以及居住在它们身上的精神，都是有生命的，尽管有些比其他物体更有意识，更警觉，更聪明。最强大的精神甚至可能被视为神灵。所有这些都是值得尊重的，如果不是崇敬的话。",
	"Animists don't typically pay allegiance to one spirit over the others. Instead, they offer prayers and sacrifices to different spirits at different times, as appropriate to the situation. A pious character might make daily prayers and offerings to ancestor spirits and the spirits of the house, regular petitions to important spirits such as the Seven Fortunes of Good Luck, occasional sacrifices of incense to location spirits such as the spirit of a forest, and sporadic prayers to a host of other spirits as well.": "万物有灵论者通常不会向一个神灵效忠，而向其他神灵效忠。相反，他们在不同的时间向不同的神灵祈祷和献祭，以适应情况的需要。一个虔诚的人物可能会每天向祖先的神灵和房子的神灵祈祷和献祭，定期向重要的神灵如七福神请愿，偶尔向地点的神灵如森林的神灵献上香火，以及向许多其他神灵零星祈祷。",
	"An animistic religion is very tolerant. Most spirits don't care to whom a character also offers sacrifices, as long as they receive the sacrifices and respect they are due. As new religions spread through animist lands, those religions typically win adherents but not converts. People incorporate new spirits and deities into their prayers without displacing the old ones. Contemplatives and scholars adopt complex philosophical systems and practices without changing their belief in and respect for the spirits they already venerate.": "一个万物有灵的宗教是非常宽容的。大多数神灵并不关心一个角色也向谁提供祭品，只要他们得到应有的祭品和尊重。当新的宗教在万物有灵论的土地上传播时，这些宗教通常会赢得信徒，但不是皈依者。人们将新的精神和神灵纳入他们的祈祷中，而不会取代旧的精神和神灵。沉思者和学者们采用复杂的哲学体系和实践，而不改变他们对已经崇敬的神灵的信仰和尊重。",
	"Animism functions as a large tight pantheon. Animist clerics serve the pantheon as a whole, and so can choose any domain, representing a favorite spirit for that cleric.": "万物有灵论的功能是一个大型的紧密的万神殿。万物有灵教的教士为整个万神殿服务，因此可以选择任何领域，代表该教士最喜欢的精神。",
	"Not all divine powers need to be derived from deities. In some campaigns, believers hold enough conviction in their ideas about the universe that they gain magical power from that conviction. In other campaigns, impersonal forces of nature or magic replace the gods by granting power to mortals attuned to them. Just as druids and rangers can gain their spell ability from the force of nature rather than from a specific nature deity, some clerics devote themselves to ideals rather than to a god. Paladins might serve a philosophy of justice and chivalry rather than a specific deity.": "并非所有的神力都需要来自神灵。在一些活动中，信徒们对他们关于宇宙的想法持有足够的信念，他们从这种信念中获得了神奇的力量。在其他战役中，非个人的自然或魔法力量取代了神灵，将力量授予与之相适应的凡人。就像德鲁伊和游侠可以从自然之力而不是特定的自然神灵那里获得法术能力一样，一些牧师将自己奉献给理想而不是神灵。圣骑士可能服务于一种正义和骑士精神的哲学，而不是一个特定的神灵。",
	"Forces and philosophies aren't worshiped; they aren't beings that can hear and respond to prayers or accept sacrifices. Devotion to a philosophy or a force isn't necessarily exclusive of service to a deity. A person can be devoted to the philosophy of good and offer worship to various good deities, or revere the force of nature and also pay homage to the gods of nature, who might be seen as personal manifestations of an impersonal force. In a world that includes deities with demonstrable power (through their clerics), it's unusual for a philosophy to deny the existence of deities, although a common philosophical belief states that the deities are more like mortals than they would have mortals believe. According to such philosophies, the gods aren't truly immortal (just very long-lived), and mortals can attain divinity. In fact, ascending to godhood is the ultimate goal of some philosophies.": "力量和哲学不受崇拜；它们不是能听到并回应祈祷或接受祭品的生命。对一种哲学或一种力量的奉献并不一定与对神灵的服务相排斥。一个人可以献身于善的哲学，并向各种善的神灵提供崇拜，或者崇尚自然的力量，同时也向自然之神致敬，他们可能被视为一种非个人力量的个人表现。在一个包括具有可证明力量的神灵（通过他们的神职人员）的世界里，一种哲学否认神灵的存在是不寻常的，尽管一种常见的哲学信念指出，神灵比他们让凡人相信的更像凡人。根据这种哲学，神灵并非真正不朽（只是非常长寿），凡人可以达到神性。事实上，提升为神是一些哲学的最终目标。",
	"The power of a philosophy stems from the belief that mortals invest in it. A philosophy that only one person believes in isn't strong enough to bestow magical power on that person.": "哲学的力量源于凡人对它的信仰。只有一个人相信的哲学并不足以赋予这个人神奇的力量。",
	"When it comes to the gods, humans exhibit a far wider range of beliefs and institutions than other races do. In many D&D settings, orcs, elves, dwarves, goblins, and other humanoids have tight pantheons. It is expected that an orc will worship Gruumsh or one of a handful of subordinate deities. In comparison, humanity embraces a staggering variety of deities. Each human culture might have its own array of gods.": "谈到神灵，人类表现出的信仰和制度远比其他种族广泛。在许多D&D设定中，兽人、精灵、矮人、地精和其他人类都有严格的神殿。预计兽人将崇拜格鲁姆什或少数几个附属神灵中的一个。相比之下，人类拥护的神灵种类多得惊人。每个人类文化都可能有自己的神灵阵列。",
	"In most D&D settings, there is no single god that can claim to have created humanity. Thus, the human proclivity for building institutions extends to religion. A single charismatic prophet can convert an entire kingdom to the worship of a new god. With that prophet's death, the religion might wax or wane, or the prophet's followers might turn against one another and found several competing religions.": "在大多数D&D设定中，没有一个神可以声称创造了人类。因此，人类建立机构的倾向性也延伸到了宗教。一个有魅力的先知可以让整个王国的人崇拜一个新的神。随着先知的死亡，该宗教可能会消亡，或者先知的追随者们可能会反目成仇，成立几个相互竞争的宗教。",
	"In comparison, religion in dwarven society is set in stone. The dwarves of the Forgotten Realms identify Moradin as their creator. While individual dwarves might follow other gods, as a culture the dwarves are pledged to Moradin and the pantheon he leads. His teachings and magic are so thoroughly ingrained in dwarven culture that it would take a cataclysmic shift to replace him.": "相比之下，矮人社会的宗教是固定的。被遗忘的王国的矮人将莫拉丁视为他们的创造者。虽然个别矮人可能会追随其他神灵，但作为一种文化，矮人对莫拉丁和他领导的万神殿是有承诺的。他的教义和魔法在矮人文化中根深蒂固，要想取代他，就必须进行一场大灾难。",
	"With that in mind, consider the role of the gods in your world and their ties to different humanoid races. Does each race have a creator god? How does that god shape that race's culture? Are other folk free of such divine ties and free to worship as they wish? Has a race turned against the god that created it? Has a new race appeared, created by a god within the past few years? A deity might also have ties to a kingdom, noble line, or other cultural institution. With the death of the emperor, a new ruler might be selected by divine portents sent by the deity who protected the empire in its earliest days. In such a land, the worship of other gods might be outlawed or tightly controlled.": "考虑到这一点，考虑诸神在你的世界中的作用以及他们与不同人种的关系。每个种族都有一个创造者之神吗？该神如何塑造该种族的文化？其他民族是否没有这种神的联系，可以自由地按自己的意愿进行崇拜？一个种族是否已经背叛了创造它的神？是否出现了一个新的种族，在过去几年内由一个神创造？一个神灵也可能与一个王国、贵族阶层或其他文化机构有联系。随着皇帝的死亡，新的统治者可能是由早期保护帝国的神灵发出的神兆来选择的。在这样的土地上，对其他神灵的崇拜可能被禁止或被严格控制。",
	"Finally, consider the difference between gods who are tied to specific humanoid races and gods with more diverse followers. Do the races with their own pantheons enjoy a place of privilege in your world, with their gods taking an active role in their affairs? Are the other races ignored by the gods, or are those races the deciding factor that can tilt the balance of power in favor of one god or another?": "最后，考虑与特定人形种族相联系的神和拥有更多不同追随者的神之间的区别。拥有自己万神殿的种族在你的世界中是否享有特权，他们的神在他们的事务中发挥着积极作用？其他种族是否被诸神忽视，或者这些种族是否是能够使权力的天平向一个或另一个神倾斜的决定性因素？",
	"When creating the world where your campaign takes place, you'll want a map. You can take one of two approaches with it: top-down or bottom-up. Some DMs like to start at the top, creating the big picture of the world at the start of the campaign by having a map that shows whole continents, and then zooming in on smaller areas. Other DMs prefer to go the opposite direction, starting with a small campaign area that is mapped at a province or kingdom scale, then zooming out as adventures take the characters into new territory. Whichever approach you take, hexes work well for mapping outdoor environments where travel can go in any direction and calculating distance might be important. A single sheet of hex paper with 5 hexes to the inch is ideal for most maps. Use a scale for your map that's best suited to the level of detail you want. Chapter 7 offers more information about creating and mapping wilderness areas.": "当创建你的活动发生的世界时，你会想要一张地图。你可以采取两种方法中的一种：自上而下或自下而上。有些DM喜欢从头开始，在战役开始时通过一张显示整个大陆的地图来创建世界的大画面，然后再放大到较小的区域。其他DM喜欢反其道而行之，从一个小的战役区域开始，以省或王国为单位绘制地图，然后随着冒险将人物带入新的领域而放大。无论你采取哪种方法，六边形都能很好地绘制户外环境，在这种环境中，旅行可以向任何方向进行，计算距离可能很重要。一张每英寸5个六角的六角纸是大多数地图的理想选择。为你的地图使用一个最适合你想要的详细程度的比例。第七章提供了更多关于创建和绘制荒野地区的信息。",
	"For the most detailed areas of your world, use a province scale where each hex represents 1 mile. A full-page map at this scale represents an area that can be covered in one day's travel in any direction from the center of the map, assuming clear terrain. As such, province scale is a useful scale for mapping a campaign's starting area (see \"Creating a Campaign,\" later in this chapter) or any location where you expect to track the adventurers' movement in hours rather than days.": "对于你的世界中最详细的区域，使用省的比例尺，每个六角代表1英里。在这种比例尺下，一张整页的地图所代表的区域，在假设地形清晰的情况下，从地图中心的任何方向出发，一天的行程都可以覆盖。因此，省的比例尺对于绘制战役的起始区（见本章后面的 \"创建战役\"）或任何你希望以小时而不是以天为单位跟踪冒险者行动的地点来说是很有用的。",
	"The ground cover of an area this size will include broad stretches of one predominant terrain type, broken up by other isolated terrain types.": "这种规模的地区的地面覆盖将包括一种主要地形类型的广泛延伸，并被其他孤立的地形类型打破。",
	"A settled region mapped at this scale might have one town and eight to twelve villages or farming hamlets. A wilder region might have only a single keep, or no settlements at all. You can also indicate the extent of the cleared farmland that surrounds each city or town. On a province-scale map, this will show as a belt a few hexes wide surrounding each town or village. Even small villages farm most of the arable land within a mile or two.": "在这种规模的地图上，一个定居地区可能有一个城镇和8至12个村庄或农庄。一个比较荒凉的地区可能只有一个村庄，或者根本就没有定居点。你还可以指出每个城市或城镇周围的农田被清理的范围。在全省范围的地图上，这将显示为围绕每个城镇或村庄的几个六分之一宽的地带。即使是小村庄也会在一两英里内耕种大部分的可耕地。",
	"On a kingdom-scale map, each hex represents 6 miles. A map at this scale covers a large region, about the size of Great Britain or half the size of the state of California. That's plenty of room for adventuring.": "在王国规模的地图上，每个六角代表6英里。这种比例尺的地图涵盖了一个很大的区域，大约是大不列颠的大小或加利福尼亚的一半大小。这为冒险活动提供了足够的空间。",
	"The first step of mapping a region at this scale is to sketch out the coastlines and any major bodies of water in the area. Is the region landlocked or on a coast? A coastal region might include islands offshore, and a landlocked area might include an inland sea or major lakes. Alternatively, the region could consist of a single large island, or an isthmus or peninsula with multiple coastlines. Next, sketch in any major mountain ranges. Foothills form a transition between the mountains and lowlands, and broad patches of gentle hills might dot the region. That leaves the rest of your map for relatively flat terrain: grasslands, forests, swamps, and the like. Place these elements as you see fit.": "以这种比例绘制地区地图的第一步是勾勒出该地区的海岸线和任何主要水体。该地区是内陆地区还是沿海地区？沿海地区可能包括离岸的岛屿，而内陆地区可能包括内陆海或主要湖泊。另外，该地区可能由一个大岛，或一个有多条海岸线的地峡或半岛组成。接下来，勾画出任何主要的山脉。山麓是山区和低地之间的过渡，宽阔的丘陵可能会点缀该地区。这就为地图的其余部分留下了相对平坦的地形：草原、森林、沼泽，等等。按你认为合适的方式放置这些元素。",
	"Map out the courses of any rivers that flow through the area. Rivers are born in mountains or inland areas that see a lot of rainfall, winding down to the nearest major body of water that doesn't require the river to cross over higher elevation. Tributaries join rivers as they grow larger and move toward a lake or the sea.": "绘制出流经该地区的任何河流的路线。河流诞生于山区或降雨量大的内陆地区，蜿蜒流向最近的主要水体，不需要河流跨越高海拔。当河流变大并向湖泊或海洋移动时，支流会加入河流。",
	"Finally, place the major towns and cities of the region. At this scale, you don't need to worry about small towns and villages, or about mapping every belt of farmland. Even so, a settled region this size might easily have eight to twelve cities or towns to put on the map.": "最后，放置该地区的主要城镇。在这种规模下，你不需要担心小城镇和村庄，也不需要担心绘制每条农田带。即便如此，这么大的一个定居地区可能很容易就有八到十二个城市或城镇要放在地图上。",
	"For mapping a whole continent, use a scale where 1 hex represents 60 miles. At this scale, you can't see more than the shape of coastlines, the biggest mountain ranges, major rivers, huge lakes, and political boundaries. A map at this scale is best for showing how multiple kingdom-scale maps fit together, rather than tracking the movement of adventurers day by day.": "对于绘制整个大陆的地图，使用的比例尺是1个六边形代表60英里。在这种比例尺下，你只能看到海岸线的形状、最大的山脉、主要河流、巨大的湖泊和政治边界。这种比例尺的地图最适合于展示多个王国规模的地图是如何结合在一起的，而不是逐日追踪冒险者的行动。",
	"The same process you use for mapping a region at kingdom scale works for mapping a whole continent. A continent might have eight to twelve large cities that deserve a place on the map, most likely major trade centers and the capitals of kingdoms.": "你在绘制王国规模的地区地图时使用的程序也适用于绘制整个大陆的地图。一个大陆可能有8到12个值得在地图上占有一席之地的大型城市，很可能是主要的贸易中心和王国的首都。",
	"Whichever scale you start with, it's easy to zoom in or out on your maps. At continent scale, 1 hex represents the same area as 10 kingdom-scale hexes. Two cities that are 3 hexes (180 miles) apart on your continent map would be 30 hexes apart on your kingdom map, and might define the opposite ends of the region you're detailing. At kingdom scale, 1 hex equals 6 province-scale hexes, so it's easy to put the region covered by your province-scale map into the center of a kingdom-scale map and create interesting areas around it.": "无论你从哪种比例开始，都很容易放大或缩小你的地图。在大陆比例尺上，1个六边形代表与10个王国比例尺相同的区域。在大陆地图上相距3个六边形（180英里）的两个城市，在王国地图上则相距30个六边形，它们可能是你所描述的地区的两端。在王国比例尺上，1个六边形等于6个省比例尺的六边形，因此很容易将省比例尺地图所覆盖的区域放到王国比例尺地图的中心，并在其周围创建有趣的区域。",
	"The places where people live-bustling cities, prosperous towns, and tiny villages nestled among miles of farmland-help define the nature of civilization in your world. A single settlement—a home base for your adventurers-is a great place to start a campaign and begin your world building. Consider the following questions as you create any settlement in your world:": "人们居住的地方--喧嚣的城市、繁荣的城镇和依偎在数英里农田中的小村庄--有助于确定你的世界中文明的性质。一个单一的定居点--你的冒险者的大本营--是一个开始活动和开始你的世界建设的好地方。当你在你的世界中创建任何定居点时，请考虑以下问题。",

	"A settlement exists primarily to facilitate the story and fun of your campaign. Other than that point, the settlement's purpose determines the amount of detail you put into it.

	"A settlement might serve as a place where the characters stop to rest and to buy supplies. A settlement of this sort needs no more than a brief description. Include the settlement's name, decide how big it is, add a dash of flavor (\"The smell of the local tanneries never lifts from this town\"), and let the adventurers get on with their business. The history of the inn where the characters spend the night, the mannerisms of the shopkeeper they buy supplies from-you can add this level of detail, but you don't have to. If the characters return to the same settlement, start adding these local features so that it begins to feel a little more like a home base, albeit a temporary one. Let the settlement develop as the need arises.": "定居点可以作为人物停下来休息和购买物资的地方。一个这样的定居点只需要一个简单的描述。包括定居点的名字，决定它有多大，加上一点味道（\"当地制革厂的气味从未从这个镇上散去\"），然后让冒险家们继续他们的生意。人物过夜的旅店的历史，他们购买物资的店主的举止--你可以添加这种程度的细节，但你不必这样做。如果人物回到同一个定居点，就开始添加这些当地的特征，这样它就开始有点像一个大本营了，尽管是临时的。随着需求的出现，让定居点发展起来。",
	"A settlement gives the adventurers a place to live, train, and recuperate between adventures. An entire campaign can center on a particular town or city. Such a settlement is the launching pad from which the characters go out into the wider world.": "定居点为冒险者提供了一个在冒险之间生活、训练和休整的地方。整个活动可以以一个特定的城镇或城市为中心。这样的聚居地是一个发射台，角色们从这里出发，进入更广阔的世界。",

	"To make a home base come alive, you'll need to invest some time fleshing out details, but the players can help you with that work. Ask them to tell you a bit about mentors, family members, and other important people in their characters' lives. Feel free to add to and modify what they give you, but you'll start with a solid foundation of the nonplayer characters (NPCs) who are important to the characters. Let the players describe where and how their characters spend their time—a favorite tavern, library, or temple, perhaps.": "要想让大本营变得生动，你需要投入一些时间来充实细节，但玩家可以帮助你完成这项工作。请他们告诉你一些关于导师、家庭成员和他们角色生活中其他重要人物的情况。你可以自由地补充和修改他们提供的信息，但你要从对角色很重要的非玩家角色（NPCs）的坚实基础开始。让玩家描述他们的角色在哪里以及如何度过他们的时间--也许是最喜欢的小酒馆、图书馆或寺庙。",
	"Using these NPCs and locations as a starting point, flesh out the settlement's cast of characters. Detail its leadership, including law enforcement (discussed later in the chapter). Include characters who can provide information, such as sages, soothsayers, librarians, and observant vagabonds. Priests can provide spellcasting as well as information. Make note of merchants who might regularly interact with the adventurers and perhaps compete with one another for the party's business. Think about the people who run the adventurers' favorite tavern. And then add a handful of wild cards: a shady dealer, a mad prophet, a retired mercenary, a drunken rake, or anyone else who adds a dash of adventure and intrigue to your campaign.": "以这些NPC和地点为起点，充实定居点的人物阵容。详细说明其领导层，包括执法部门（在本章后面讨论）。包括可以提供信息的人物，如圣人、占卜师、图书管理员和观察力强的流浪者。牧师可以提供法术和信息。记下那些可能经常与冒险者打交道的商人，也许他们会为了聚会的生意相互竞争。想一想那些经营冒险者最喜欢的酒馆的人。然后再加上几张野牌：一个阴暗的商人、一个疯狂的预言家、一个退休的雇佣兵、一个醉醺醺的耙子，或者其他任何为你的活动增添冒险和阴谋的人。",

That key element suggests a wealth of sensory details: the sight of colorful boats floating on muddy waters, the sound of lapping waves and perhaps singing gondoliers, the smells of fish and waste polluting the water, the feel of humidity. Or perhaps the city is shrouded in fog much of the time, and you describe the tendrils of cold mist reaching through every crack and cranny, the muffled sounds of hooves on cobblestones, the cold air with the smell of rain, and a sense of mystery and lurking danger.": "也许一个城市是围绕运河而建的，就像现实世界中的威尼斯。这个关键因素暗示了大量的感官细节：五颜六色的船只漂浮在泥泞的水面上的景象，拍打波浪的声音，也许还有贡多拉的歌声，鱼和废物污染水的气味，潮湿的感觉。或者，这个城市大部分时间都笼罩在雾中，而你描述了冷雾的卷轴从每一个缝隙中伸入，马蹄在鹅卵石上发出的闷响，寒冷的空气中弥漫着雨的味道，以及一种神秘感和潜伏的危险。",
	"The climate and terrain of a settlement's environment, its origin and inhabitants, its government and political position, and its commercial importance all have a bearing on its overall atmosphere. A city nestled against the edge of a jungle has a very different feel than one on the edge of a desert. Elf and dwarf cities present a distinct aesthetic, clearly identifiable in contrast to human-built ones. Soldiers patrol the streets to quell any hint of dissent in a city ruled by a tyrant, while a city fostering an early system of democracy might boast an open-air market where philosophical ideas are traded as freely as produce. All the possible combinations of these factors can inspire endless variety in the settlements of your campaign world.": "一个定居点的气候和地形，它的起源和居民，它的政府和政治地位，以及它的商业重要性，都对它的整体氛围有影响。依偎在丛林边缘的城市与位于沙漠边缘的城市有着非常不同的感觉。精灵和矮人的城市呈现出一种独特的美感，与人类建造的城市形成鲜明的对比，清晰可辨。在一个由暴君统治的城市中，士兵们在街上巡逻以平息任何异议，而一个培养早期民主制度的城市可能会拥有一个露天市场，在那里哲学思想可以像农产品一样自由交易。这些因素的所有可能的组合可以激发你的战役世界的定居点的无尽变化。",
	"In the feudal society common in most D&D worlds, power and authority are concentrated in towns and cities. Nobles hold authority over the settlements where they live and the surrounding lands. They collect taxes from the populace, which they use for public building projects, to pay the soldiery, and to support a comfortable lifestyle for themselves (although nobles often have considerable hereditary wealth). In exchange, they promise to protect their citizens from threats such as orc marauders, hobgoblin armies, and roving human bandits.": "在大多数D&D世界中常见的封建社会中，权力和权威都集中在城镇和城市。贵族们对他们所居住的定居点和周围的土地拥有权力。他们向民众征税，用于公共建筑项目，支付士兵的工资，并支持自己的舒适生活（尽管贵族通常拥有相当多的世袭财富）。作为交换，他们承诺保护他们的公民免受威胁，如兽人掠夺者、哥布林军队和游荡的人类土匪。",
	"Nobles appoint officers as their agents in villages, to supervise the collection of taxes and serve as judges in disputes and criminal trials. These reeves, sheriffs, or bailiffs are commoners native to the villages they govern, chosen for their positions because they already hold the respect of their fellow citizens.": "贵族们任命官员作为他们在村庄的代理人，负责监督税收，并在争端和刑事审判中担任法官。这些执法官、治安官或法警都是他们所管辖的村庄的平民，他们被选中担任这些职务是因为他们已经得到了同胞的尊重。",
	"Within towns and cities, lords share authority and administrative responsibility with lesser nobles (usually their own relatives), and also with representatives of the middle class, such as traders and artisans. A lord mayor of noble birth is appointed to head the town or city council and to perform the same administrative functions that reeves carry out in villages. The council consists of representatives elected by the middle class.": "在城镇中，领主与较小的贵族（通常是他们自己的亲属）分享权力和行政责任，也与中产阶级的代表，如商人和工匠分享。一位贵族出身的市长被任命为镇或市议会的领导，并履行与村长在村庄中履行的相同的行政职能。议会由中产阶级选出的代表组成。",
	"Only foolish nobles ignore the wishes of their councils, since the economic power of the middle class is often more important to the prosperity of a town or city than the hereditary authority of the nobility.": "只有愚蠢的贵族才会无视议会的意愿，因为中产阶级的经济实力对一个城镇的繁荣往往比贵族的世袭权力更重要。",
	"The larger a settlement, the more likely that other individuals or organizations hold significant power there as well. Even in a village, a popular individual—a wise elder or a well-liked farmer-can wield more influence than the appointed reeve, and a wise reeve avoids making an enemy of such a person. In towns and cities, the same power might lie in the hands of a prominent temple, a guild independent of the council, or an individual with magical power.": "一个定居点越大，其他个人或组织就越有可能在那里拥有重要的权力。即使在一个村子里，一个受欢迎的人--一个聪明的长者或一个受人欢迎的农民--可以比指定的村长有更大的影响力，一个聪明的村长会避免与这样的人为敌。在城镇，同样的权力可能掌握在一个著名的寺庙、一个独立于议会的行会或一个拥有魔法力量的人手中。",
	"A settlement rarely stands alone. A given town or city might be a theocratic city-state or a prosperous free city governed by a merchant council. More likely, it's part of a feudal kingdom, a bureaucratic empire, or a remote realm ruled by an iron-fisted tyrant. Consider how your settlement fits into the bigger picture of your world or region-who rules its ruler, and what other settlements might also lie under its control.": "一个定居点很少单独存在。一个特定的城镇或城市可能是一个神权城邦或一个由商人委员会管理的繁荣的自由城市。更有可能的是，它是一个封建王国的一部分，一个官僚帝国，或者一个由铁腕暴君统治的偏远地区。考虑你的定居点如何融入你的世界或地区的大局--谁统治着它的统治者，还有哪些其他的定居点可能在它的控制之下。",

The coins of the old elven court of Cormanthyr are particularly famous: thalvers (coppers), bedoars (silvers), thammarchs (electrum), shilmaers (golds), and ruendils (platinum). These coins are fine, numerous, and sometimes still used in trade among elves.": "相反，久违的、传说中的土地和伟大的魔法中心的硬币则受到尊敬，尽管那些找到它们的人明智地将它们卖给收藏家，而不是仅仅在市场上消费。科曼瑟尔（Cormanthyr）古老的精灵宫廷的硬币特别有名：thalvers（铜）、bedoars（银）、thammarchs（电子）、shilmaers（金）和ruendils（白金）。这些钱币精美，数量众多，有时还用于精灵之间的贸易。",
	"Large numbers of coins can be difficult to transport and account for.

This might make communication (and diplomacy) between two kingdoms significantly more difficult.": "在一些世界里，地区差异可能比种族差异更重要。也许生活在一个王国的所有矮人、精灵和人类都说一种共同的语言，而这种语言与邻近王国的语言完全不同。这可能会使两个王国之间的沟通（和外交）变得非常困难。",
	"Widely used languages might have ancient versions, or there might be completely different ancient tongues that adventurers find written in tombs and ruins. Such languages can add an element of mystery to inscriptions and tomes that characters encounter.": "广泛使用的语言可能有古老的版本，或者冒险者在墓穴和废墟中发现的完全不同的古代语言。这种语言可以为角色遇到的铭文和古籍增加神秘的元素。",
	"You might invent additional secret languages, besides Druidic and thieves' cant, that allow members of certain organizations or political affiliations to communicate. You could even decide that each alignment has its own language, which might be more of an argot used primarily to discuss philosophical concepts.": "除了德鲁伊语和盗贼语之外，你还可以发明更多的秘密语言，让某些组织或政治派别的成员能够交流。你甚至可以决定每一种结盟都有自己的语言，这可能更像是一种主要用于讨论哲学概念的论调。",
	"In a region where one race has subjugated another, the language of the conquerors can become a mark of social status. Similarly, reading and writing might be restricted by law to the upper classes of a society.": "在一个种族征服了另一个种族的地区，征服者的语言可能成为社会地位的标志。同样，阅读和写作可能被法律限制在一个社会的上层阶级中。",
	"Temples, guilds, orders, secret societies, and colleges are important forces in the social order of any civilization. Their influence might stretch across multiple towns and cities, with or without a similarly wide-ranging political authority. Organizations can play an important part in the lives of player characters, becoming their patrons, allies, or enemies just like individual nonplayer characters. When characters join these organizations, they become part of something larger than themselves, which can give their adventures a context in the wider world.": "在任何文明的社会秩序中，寺庙、行会、教团、秘密社团和学院都是重要的力量。他们的影响力可能会延伸到多个城镇和城市，无论是否有类似的广泛的政治权力。组织可以在玩家角色的生活中发挥重要作用，成为他们的赞助人、盟友或敌人，就像个别非玩家角色一样。当角色加入这些组织时，他们就成了比自己更大的东西的一部分，这可以使他们的冒险在更广阔的世界中获得背景。",
	"At the start of a campaign, backgrounds are a great way to connect adventurers to your world. As the game progresses, though, background ties often become less important.": "在活动开始时，背景是将冒险者与你的世界联系起来的一个好方法。不过，随着游戏的进展，背景联系往往变得不那么重要。",
	"Factions and organizations aimed at player characters are a way to keep higher-level adventurers connected to your world, providing ties to key NPCs and a clear agenda beyond individual gain. In the same way, villainous organizations create an ongoing sense of menace above and beyond the threat of solitary foes.": "以玩家角色为目标的派别和组织是让更高级别的冒险者与你的世界保持联系的一种方式，它提供了与关键NPC的联系和超越个人利益的明确议程。同样地，反派组织创造了一种持续的威胁感，超过了单独的敌人的威胁。",
	"Having different characters tied to different factions can create interesting situations at the gaming table, as long as those factions have similar goals and don't work in opposition to one another all the time. Adventurers representing different factions might have competing interests or priorities while they pursue the same goals.": "让不同的角色与不同的派别联系在一起，可以在游戏桌上创造出有趣的局面，只要这些派别有类似的目标，而不是一直在相互对立的情况下工作。代表不同派别的冒险者在追求相同目标的同时，可能会有相互竞争的利益或优先事项。",
	"Adventurer organizations are also a great source of special rewards beyond experience points and treasure. Increased standing in an organization has value in and of itself, and might also come with concrete benefits such as access to an organization's information, equipment, magic, and other resources.": "冒险者组织也是经验值和宝藏之外的特殊奖励的重要来源。在一个组织中地位的提高本身就有价值，而且还可能带来具体的好处，比如获得一个组织的信息、设备、魔法和其他资源。",
	"Factions and organizations that you create for your campaign should grow out of the stories that are important to the world. Create organizations that your players will want to interact with, whether as allies, members, or enemies.": "你为你的活动创建的派别和组织应该从对这个世界很重要的故事中发展出来。创建玩家愿意与之互动的组织，无论是作为盟友、成员还是敌人。",
	"As a starting point, decide what role you want an organization to play in the world. What is it all about? What are its goals? Who founded it and why? What do its members do? Answering these questions should give you a good sense of the organization's personality. From there, think about typical members. How might people describe them? What are the typical members' classes and alignments? What personality traits do they tend to share?": "作为一个起点，决定你希望一个组织在世界上扮演什么角色。它的目的是什么？它的目标是什么？谁创立了它，为什么？其成员是做什么的？回答了这些问题，你就能很好地了解该组织的个性。从那里，想想典型的成员。人们会如何描述他们？典型成员的阶级和联盟是什么？他们有哪些共同的个性特征？",
	"Choosing a symbol and a motto for the organization is a way of summing up the work you've done so far. A faction that uses a stag as a symbol probably has a very different personality from one that uses a winged viper. For a motto, choose not just a message but also a tone and style of speech that fits the organization as you've defined it. Consider the motto of the Harpers: \"Down with tyranny. Fairness and equality for all.\" The Harpers have a straightforward message of freedom and prosperity. Contrast that with the motto of a group of politically allied cities in the North calling themselves the Lords' Alliance: \"Threats to home must be terminated without prejudice. Superiority is our security.\" These are sophisticated people involved in a delicate political alliance, with more emphasis on stability than on fairness and equality.": "为组织选择一个标志和座右铭是对你到目前为止所做工作的一种总结。一个使用雄鹿作为标志的派别可能与使用带翅膀的毒蛇的派别有着非常不同的个性。对于座右铭，不仅要选择一个信息，还要选择适合你所定义的组织的语气和风格。考虑一下哈珀斯的座右铭。\"打倒暴政。公平和平等属于所有人\"。哈珀人有一个关于自由和繁荣的直截了当的信息。与之相对应的是北方一群自称 \"领主联盟 \"的政治联盟城市的箴言。\"必须无偏见地终止对家园的威胁。优势是我们的安全。\" 这些是参与微妙的政治联盟的成熟人士，他们更强调稳定而不是公平和平等。",
	"Finally, think about the ways that player characters might come into contact with the organization. Who are the important members-not just the leaders, but the agents in the field that the adventurers might encounter? Where are they active, and where do they have headquarters or strongholds? If adventurers do join, what kind of missions might they be sent on? What rewards can they gain?": "最后，考虑一下玩家角色可能与该组织接触的方式。谁是重要的成员--不仅仅是领导人，还有冒险者可能遇到的实地代理人？他们在哪里活动，他们在哪里有总部或据点？如果冒险者真的加入，他们可能被派去执行什么样的任务？他们能获得什么奖励？",
	"The Harpers is a scattered network of spellcasters and spies who advocate equality and covertly oppose the abuse of power, magical or otherwise.": "哈珀斯是一个分散的施法者和间谍网络，他们倡导平等，暗中反对滥用权力，无论是魔法还是其他方面。",
	"The organization has risen, been shattered, and risen again several times. Its longevity and resilience are largely due to its decentralized, grassroots, secretive nature, and the autonomy of its various members. The Harpers have small cells and lone operatives throughout the Forgotten Realms, although they interact and share information with one another from time to time as needs warrant. The Harpers' ideology is noble, and its members pride themselves on their ingenuity and incorruptibility. Harpers don't seek power or glory, only fair and equal treatment for all.": "该组织已经崛起，被打碎，又重新崛起了好几次。它的寿命和复原力主要归功于其分散的、草根的、秘密的性质，以及其不同成员的自主性。哈珀斯在整个被遗忘的领域都有小型的细胞和孤独的特工，尽管他们不时地根据需要相互交流和分享信息。哈珀人的意识形态是高尚的，其成员以他们的聪明才智和廉洁自律为荣。哈珀人不追求权力或荣耀，只追求所有人的公平和平等待遇。",
	"Down with tyranny. Fairness and equality for all.": "打倒暴政。公平和平等，人人有份。",
	"The Harpers' beliefs can be summarized as follows:": "哈珀人的信念可以概括为以下几点。",
	"One can never have too much information or arcane knowledge.": "一个人永远不可能有太多的信息或神秘的知识。",
	"Too much power leads to corruption, and the abuse of magic in particular must be closely monitored.": "太多的权力会导致腐败，尤其是对魔法的滥用必须受到密切监控。",
	"No one should be powerless.": "没有人应该是无能为力的。",
	"Gather information throughout Faerun, discern the political dynamics within each region, and promote fairness and equality by covert means. Act openly as a last resort. Thwart tyrants and any leader, government, or group that grows too powerful. Aid the weak, the poor, and the oppressed.": "在整个Faerun收集信息，了解每个地区的政治动态，并通过秘密手段促进公平和平等。作为最后的手段，公开行动。挫败暴君和任何变得过于强大的领袖、政府或团体。援助弱者、穷人和被压迫者。",
	"Typical Harper quests include securing an artifact that would upset the balance of power in a region, gathering information on a powerful individual or organization, and determining the true intentions of an ambitious political figure or evil spellcaster.": "典型的哈珀任务包括确保一件会破坏一个地区权力平衡的文物，收集关于一个强大的个人或组织的信息，以及确定一个野心勃勃的政治人物或邪恶施法者的真实意图。",
	"The Zhentarim (also known as the Black Network) is an unscrupulous shadow network that seeks to expand its influence and power throughout the Forgotten Realms. The public face of the Black Network appears relatively benign. It offers the best and cheapest goods and services, both legal and illicit, thus destroying its competitors and making everyone dependent on it.": "真塔林（Zhentarim）（又称黑网）是一个不择手段的影子网络，它试图在整个被遗忘的王国中扩大其影响力和权力。黑网的公众形象看起来相对温和。它提供最好和最便宜的商品和服务，包括合法的和非法的，从而摧毁了它的竞争对手，使每个人都依赖它。",
	"A member of the Zhentarim thinks of himself or herself as a member of a very large family and relies on the Black Network for resources and security. However, members are granted the autonomy to pursue their own interests and gain some measure of personal wealth and influence. As a whole, the Zhentarim promises \"the best of the best,\" although in truth the organization is more interested in spreading its own propaganda and influence than investing in the improvement of its individual members.": "镇塔林的成员认为自己是一个非常大的家族的成员，并依靠黑色网络获得资源和安全。然而，成员被授予自主权，可以追求自己的利益，并获得一定程度的个人财富和影响力。作为一个整体，Zhentarim承诺 \"最好中的最好\"，尽管事实上该组织对传播自己的宣传和影响更感兴趣，而不是投资于其个人成员的改善。",
	"Join us and prosper. Oppose us and suffer.": "加入我们的行列，就会繁荣。反对我们就会受苦。",
	"The Zhentarim's beliefs can be summarized as follows:": "镇塔林的信仰可以概括为以下几点。",

	"You are the master of your own destiny. Never be less than what you deserve to be.": "你是你自己命运的主人。永远不要低于你应得的地位。",
	"Everything and everyone has a price.": "每件事和每个人都有一个价格。",
	"Amass wealth, power, and influence, and thereby dominate Faerun.": "积累财富、权力和影响力，从而主宰法伦。",

	"Renown is an optional rule you can use to track an adventurer's standing within a particular faction or organization. Renown is a numerical value that starts at 0, then increases as a character earns favor and reputation within a particular organization. You can tie benefits to a character's renown, including ranks and titles within the organization and access to resources.": "声望是一个可选的规则，你可以用来追踪一个冒险者在特定派别或组织中的地位。声望是一个数值，从0开始，然后随着人物在特定组织中获得的好感和声誉而增加。你可以把好处与角色的声望联系起来，包括组织内的等级和头衔，以及获得资源的机会。",
	"A player tracks renown separately for each organization his or her character is a member of. For example, an adventurer might have 5 renown within one faction and 20 renown within another, based on the character's interaction with each organization over the course of the campaign.": "玩家为他或她的角色所加入的每个组织分别追踪名声。例如，一个冒险家可能在一个派别中拥有5个声望，在另一个派别中拥有20个声望，这是基于角色在活动过程中与每个组织的互动。",
	"A character earns renown by completing missions or quests that serve an organization's interests or involve the organization directly. You award renown at your discretion as characters complete these missions or quests, typically at the same time you award experience points.": "角色通过完成为组织利益服务或直接涉及该组织的任务或使命来获得声望。当角色完成这些任务或使命时，你会酌情授予名望，通常是在你授予经验值的同时。",
	"Advancing an organization's interests increases a character's renown within that organization by 1. Completing a mission specifically assigned by that organization, or which directly benefits the organization, increases the character's renown by 2 instead.": "完成该组织特别指定的任务，或直接有利于该组织的任务，角色的声望反而会增加2。",
	"For example, characters with connections to the noble Order of the Gauntlet complete a mission in which they free a town from the tyranny of a blue dragon. Because the order likes to punish evildoers, you might increase each character's renown within the order by 1. Conversely, if killing the dragon was a mission given to the adventurers by a senior member of the order, completing the task might instead increase each character's renown by 2, showing the adventurers as effective allies.": "例如，与高贵的高塔骑士团有联系的角色完成了一个任务，他们把一个城镇从蓝龙的暴政中解放出来。相反，如果杀龙是骑士团的高级成员交给冒险者的任务，完成这个任务反而会使每个角色的声望增加2，表明冒险者是有效的盟友。",
	"Meanwhile, the party's rogue might have looted a box of rare poisons from the dragon's hoard and sold it to a fence who is secretly a Zhentarim agent. You might increase the rogue's renown within the Zhentarim by 2 since this action directly increased that group's power and wealth, even though the task was not assigned by an agent of the Zhentarim.": "同时，队伍中的流氓可能从龙的囤积物中掠夺了一箱稀有的毒药，并把它卖给了一个暗地里是Zhentarim特工的围栏。你可能会让这个流氓在Zhentarim内部的声望增加2，因为这个行动直接增加了该组织的权力和财富，尽管这个任务不是由Zhentarim的代理人指派的。",
	"The benefits of increasing renown within an organization can include rank and authority, friendly attitudes from members of the organization, and other perks.": "在一个组织内提高声望的好处可能包括等级和权威，组织成员的友好态度，以及其他津贴。",
	"Characters can earn promotions as their renown increases. You can establish certain thresholds of renown that serve as prerequisites (though not necessarily the only prerequisites) for advancing in rank, as shown in the Examples of Faction Ranks table. For example, a character might join the Lords' Alliance after earning 1 renown within that organization, gaining the title of cloak. As the character's renown within the organization increases, he or she might be eligible for further increases in rank.": "角色可以随着他们的声望增加而获得晋升。你可以建立一定的声望门槛，作为提升等级的先决条件（虽然不一定是唯一的先决条件），如派别等级表中所示。例如，一个角色可能在加入领主联盟后，在该组织中获得了1个声望，获得了斗篷的称号。随着人物在该组织中的声望增加，他或她可能有资格进一步提高等级。",
	"You can add rank prerequisites. For example, a character affiliated with the Lords' Alliance might have to be at least 5th level before becoming a stingblade, at least 10th level to be a warduke, and at least 15th level to be a lioncrown.": "你可以增加等级的先决条件。例如，一个隶属于领主联盟的角色可能至少要达到5级才能成为刺刀手，至少要达到10级才能成为战神，至少要达到15级才能成为狮王。",
	"You can set these thresholds of renown to any numbers that work for your game, creating appropriate ranks and titles for the organizations in your campaign.": "你可以将这些声望的阈值设置为任何适合你的游戏的数字，为你的活动中的组织创造适当的等级和称号。",

	"As a character's renown within an organization grows, members of that organization are increasingly likely to have heard of the character. You can set thresholds at which the default attitude of an organization's members toward the character becomes indifferent or friendly. For example, members of the Emerald Enclave—a faction dedicated to preserving the natural order—might be less friendly toward characters who have not cultivated at least 3 renown within that organization, becoming friendly by default only when a character has gained 10 renown within the Emerald Enclave. These thresholds apply only to the default attitude of most members of an organization, and such attitudes aren't automatic. NPC faction members might dislike an adventurer despite that character's renown—or perhaps because of it.": "随着一个角色在一个组织中的声望的增长，该组织的成员越来越有可能听说过这个角色。你可以设置阈值，在这个阈值上，一个组织的成员对这个角色的默认态度变得冷漠或友好。例如，翡翠飞地（Emerald Enclave）--一个致力于保护自然秩序的派别--的成员可能对那些在该组织中没有培养出至少3个声望的角色不太友好，只有当一个角色在翡翠飞地中获得10个声望时才会默认为友好。这些阈值只适用于一个组织的大多数成员的默认态度，而且这种态度不是自动的。NPC派系的成员可能会不喜欢一个冒险者，尽管这个角色有声望，或者也许是因为这个声望。",
	"Earning a rank within an organization comes with certain benefits, as defined by you. A character of low rank might gain access to a reliable contact and adventure leads, a safe house, or a trader willing to offer a discount on adventuring gear. A middle-ranked character might gain a follower (see chapter 4, \"Creating Nonplayer Characters\"), access to potions and scrolls, the ability to call in a favor, or backup on dangerous missions. A high-ranking character might be able to call on a small army, take custody of a rare magic item, gain access to a helpful spellcaster, or assign special missions to members of lower rank.": "在一个组织中获得一个等级会带来某些好处，由你来定义。一个低等级的角色可能会获得一个可靠的联系人和冒险线索，一个安全屋，或者一个愿意为冒险装备提供折扣的商人。一个中级角色可能会获得一个追随者（见第4章，\"创建非玩家角色\"），获得药水和卷轴，有能力叫人帮忙，或在危险的任务中得到支援。一个高等级的角色可能能够召集一支小型军队，保管一个稀有的魔法物品，获得一个有用的施法者，或者给低等级的成员分配特殊任务。",
	"You might allow characters to spend downtime between adventures building relationships and gaining renown within an organization. For more information on downtime activities, see chapter 6, \"Between Adventures.\"": "你可以让角色在冒险之间的停顿时间里建立关系，并在组织中获得声誉。有关停工期活动的更多信息，请参见第6章 \"冒险之间\"。",
	"Disagreements with members of an organization aren't enough to cause a loss of renown within that organization. However, serious offenses committed against the organization or its members can result in a loss of renown and rank within the organization. The extent of the loss depends on the infraction and is left to your discretion. A character's renown within an organization can never drop below 0.": "与一个组织的成员发生分歧并不足以导致在该组织内失去声望。然而，对组织或其成员犯下的严重罪行会导致在该组织内丧失声望和等级。损失的程度取决于违规行为，由你来决定。一个角色在一个组织中的声望永远不能低于0。",
	"With a few alterations, the renown system can also serve as a measure of a character's link to the gods. It's a great option for campaigns where the gods take active roles in the world.": "只要稍加改动，名望系统也可以作为衡量一个角色与诸神联系的标准。对于诸神在世界中发挥积极作用的活动，这是一个很好的选择。",
	"Using this approach, you track renown based on specific divine figures in your campaign. Each character has the option to select a patron deity or pantheon with goals, doctrine, and taboos that you have created. Any renown he or she earns is called piety. A character gains piety for honoring his or her gods, fulfilling their commands, and respecting their taboos. A character loses piety for working against those gods, dishonoring them, defiling their temples, and foiling their aims.": "使用这种方法，你根据你的战役中的特定神性人物来追踪名声。每个角色都可以选择一个具有目标、教义和禁忌的守护神或万神殿。他或她所获得的任何荣誉都被称为虔诚度。一个角色如果尊敬他或她的神，履行他们的命令，并尊重他们的禁忌，就会获得虔诚度。一个角色如果与这些神灵作对，侮辱他们，玷污他们的庙宇，并破坏他们的目标，就会失去虔诚。",
	"The gods bestow favors on those who prove their devotion. With each rank of piety gained, a character can pray for divine favor once per day. This favor usually comes in the form of a cleric spell like bless. The favor often comes with a sign of the divine benefactor; for example, a character dedicated to Thor might receive a spell accompanied by the boom of thunder.": "诸神赐予那些证明自己虔诚的人以恩惠。每获得一个等级的虔诚，角色就可以每天祈求一次神的恩惠。这种恩惠通常以牧师法术的形式出现，如祝福。这种恩惠通常伴随着神的恩惠者的标志；例如，献给雷神的角色可能会收到一个伴随着雷声的咒语。",
	"A high level of piety can also lead to a character gaining a more persistent benefit, in the form of a blessing or charm (see chapter 7, \"Treasure,\" for such supernatural gifts).": "高水平的虔诚也可以使角色获得更持久的利益，以祝福或符咒的形式（关于这种超自然的礼物，见第七章，\"宝藏\"）。",
	"In most D&D worlds, magic is natural but still wondrous and sometimes frightening. People everywhere know about magic, and most people see evidence of it at some point in their lives. It permeates the cosmos and moves through the ancient possessions of legendary heroes, the mysterious ruins of fallen empires, those touched by the gods, creatures born with supernatural power, and individuals who study the secrets of the multiverse. Histories and fireside tales are filled with the exploits of those who wield it.": "在大多数D&D世界中，魔法是自然的，但仍然是神奇的，有时是可怕的。各地的人们都知道魔法，而且大多数人在他们生活的某个阶段都看到了魔法的证据。它渗透到宇宙中，并通过传奇英雄的古老财产、堕落帝国的神秘废墟、被神灵触动的人、天生具有超自然力量的生物以及研究多元宇宙秘密的个人而移动。历史和炉边故事中充满了那些挥舞它的人的功绩。",
	"What normal folk know of magic depends on where they live and whether they know characters who practice magic. Citizens of an isolated hamlet might not have seen true magic used for generations and speak in whispers of the strange powers of the old hermit living in the nearby woods. In the city of Waterdeep in the Forgotten Realms setting, the Watchful Order of Magists and Protectors is a guild of wizards. These arcanists wish to make wizardry more accessible so the order's members can profit from selling their services.": "普通人对魔法的了解取决于他们居住的地方以及他们是否认识练习魔法的人物。一个与世隔绝的小村庄的居民可能几代人都没有见过真正的魔法，他们会低声谈论住在附近树林里的老隐士的奇怪力量。在《被遗忘的领域》中的水底城，法师和保护者的守望团是一个巫师公会。这些奥术师希望使巫术更容易获得，因此该组织的成员可以通过出售他们的服务而获利。",
	"Some D&D settings have more magic in them than others. On Athas, the harsh world of the Dark Sun setting, arcane magic is a hated practice that can drain life from the world. Much of Athas's magic lies in the hands of evildoers. Conversely, in the world of Eberron, magic is as commonplace as any other commodity. Mercantile houses sell magic items and services to anyone who can afford them. People purchase tickets to ride airships and trains propelled by elemental magic.": "有些D&D环境中的魔法比其他的多。在阿塔斯，黑暗太阳背景下的严酷世界，奥术是一种令人讨厌的做法，会耗尽世界的生命。Athas的大部分魔法都掌握在邪恶者手中。相反，在Eberron的世界里，魔法就像其他商品一样普遍。商行向任何有能力的人出售魔法物品和服务。人们买票乘坐由元素魔法推动的飞艇和火车。",
	"Consider these questions when fitting magic into your world:": "在将魔法融入你的世界时，请考虑这些问题。",
	"Is some magic common? Is some socially unacceptable? Which magic is rare?": "有些魔术是常见的吗？有些是社会不能接受的？哪些魔法是罕见的？",
	"How unusual are members of each spellcasting class? How common are those who can cast high-level spells?": "每个法术类别的成员有多不寻常？能够施展高级法术的人有多普遍？",
	"How rare are magic items, magical locations, and creatures that have supernatural powers? At what power level do these things go from everyday to exotic?": "魔法物品、魔法地点和具有超自然力量的生物有多稀有？这些东西在多大程度上会从日常用品变成异国情调？",
	"How do authorities regulate and use magic? How do normal folks use magic and protect themselves from it?": "当局是如何监管和使用魔法的？普通人如何使用魔法并保护自己免受其害？",
	"The answers to some questions suggest the answers to others. For example, if spellcasters of low-level spells are common, as in Eberron, then authorities and common folk are more likely to have access to and use the results of such spells. Buying commonplace magic isn't only possible, but also less expensive. People are more likely to keep well-known magic in mind, and to protect against it, especially in risky situations.": "一些问题的答案暗示了其他问题的答案。例如，如果低级法术的施法者很常见，就像在Eberron那样，那么当局和普通人就更有可能获得并使用这种法术的结果。购买普通的魔法不仅是可能的，而且价格也较低。人们更有可能牢记知名的魔法，并对其进行保护，尤其是在危险的情况下。",
	"Some civilized areas might restrict or prohibit the use of magic. Spellcasting might be forbidden without a license or official permission. In such a place, magic items and continual magical effects are rare, with protections against magic being the exception.": "一些文明地区可能限制或禁止使用魔法。没有许可证或官方许可，施法可能是被禁止的。在这样的地方，魔法物品和持续的魔法效果都很罕见，对魔法的保护是个例外。",
	"Some localities might prohibit specific spells. It could be a crime to cast any spells used to steal or swindle, such as those that bestow invisibility or produce illusions. Enchantments that charm or dominate others are readily outlawed, since they rob their subjects of free will. Destructive spells are likewise prohibited, for obvious reasons. A local ruler could have a phobia about a specific effect or spell (such as shapeshifting effects if he or she were afraid of being impersonated) and enact a law restricting that type of magic.": "有些地方可能禁止特定的法术。施放任何用于偷窃或诈骗的法术都可能是一种犯罪，比如那些赋予隐形或产生幻觉的法术。魅惑或支配他人的法术很容易被取缔，因为它们剥夺了主体的自由意志。由于明显的原因，破坏性的法术也同样被禁止。一个地方的统治者可能对某种特定的效果或咒语有恐惧症（比如变形效果，如果他或她害怕被人冒充），并制定法律限制这种类型的魔法。",
	"The rules of the game refer to the schools of magic (abjuration, illusion, necromancy, and so on), but it's up to you to determine what those schools signify in your world. Similarly, a few class options suggest the existence of magic-using organizations in the world—bardic colleges and druid circles-which are up to you to flesh out.": "游戏规则中提到了魔法流派（咒语、幻术、死灵等等），但这些流派在你的世界中意味着什么，则由你来决定。同样地，一些等级选项表明世界上存在使用魔法的组织--吟游诗人学院和德鲁伊圈子--这些都是由你来充实的。",
	"You could decide that no formal structures like these exist in your world. Wizards (and bards and druids) might be so rare that a player character learns from a single mentor and never meets another character of the same class, in which case wizards would learn their school specialization without any formal training.": "你可以决定在你的世界中不存在这样的正式结构。巫师（以及吟游诗人和德鲁伊）可能非常罕见，以至于玩家角色只向一个导师学习，而从未遇到过其他同等级的角色，在这种情况下，巫师会在没有任何正式训练的情况下学习他们的学校专业。",
	"However, if magic is more common, academies can be the embodiments of the schools of magic. These institutions have their own hierarchies, traditions, regulations, and procedures. For example, Materros the necromancer could be a brother of the necromantic Cabal of Thar-Zad. As a sign of his high standing within its hierarchy, he is allowed to wear the red and green robes of a master. Of course, when he wears these robes, his occupation is easily identified by those who know of the cabal. This recognition could be a boon or a nuisance, since the Cabal of Thar-Zad has a fearsome reputation.": "然而，如果魔法比较普遍，学院可以成为魔法学校的体现。这些机构有自己的等级制度、传统、法规和程序。例如，死灵法师马特罗斯（Materros）可能是塔尔扎德（Thar-Zad）死灵法师公会的兄弟。作为他在其等级制度中的崇高地位的标志，他被允许穿上大师的红色和绿色长袍。当然，当他穿上这些袍子时，他的职业很容易被那些知道阴谋论的人识别出来。这种识别可能是一种好处，也可能是一种麻烦，因为塔尔扎德的Cabal有一个可怕的声誉。",
	"If you go this route, you can treat schools of magic, bardic colleges, and druid circles as organizations, using the guidelines for organizations presented earlier in this chapter. A player character necromancer might cultivate renown within the Cabal of Thar-Zad, while a bard seeks increasing renown within the College of Mac-Fuirmidh.": "如果你走这条路，你可以把魔法学校、吟游诗人学院和德鲁伊圈子当作组织，使用本章前面介绍的组织准则。一个玩家角色的死灵法师可能会在塔尔扎德的卡巴尔中培养声望，而一个吟游诗人则在麦克-弗尔米德学院中寻求增加声望。",
	"The presence of permanent teleportation circles in major cities helps cement their important place in the economy of a fantasy world. Spells such as plane shift, teleport, and teleportation circle connect with these circles, which are found in temples, academies, the headquarters of arcane organizations, and prominent civic locations. However, since every teleportation circle is a possible means of entry into a city, they're guarded by military and magical protection.": "主要城市中永久性传送圈的存在有助于巩固其在奇幻世界经济中的重要地位。诸如平面转移、传送和传送圈等法术都与这些传送圈有关，这些传送圈存在于寺庙、学院、奥术组织的总部和重要的市政地点。然而，由于每个传送圈都是进入城市的可能途径，所以它们受到军事和魔法的保护。",
	"As you design a fantasy city, think about the teleportation circles it might contain and which ones adventurers are likely to know about. If the adventurers commonly return to their home base by means of a teleportation circle, use that circle as a hook for plot developments in your campaign. What do the adventurers do if they arrive in a teleportation circle and find all the familiar wards disabled and guards lying in pools of blood? What if their arrival interrupts an argument between two feuding priests at the temple? Adventure ensues!": "当你设计一个奇幻城市时，考虑一下它可能包含的传送圈，以及冒险者可能知道的传送圈。如果冒险者通常通过一个传送圈回到他们的基地，那么就用这个传送圈作为你的活动中情节发展的一个钩子。如果冒险家们到达一个传送圈，发现所有熟悉的守卫都失效了，守卫躺在血泊中，他们会怎么做？如果他们的到来打断了神庙里两个不和的祭司之间的争执，又该怎么办？冒险接踵而至!",
	"When a creature dies, its soul departs its body, leaves the Material Plane, travels through the Astral Plane, and goes to abide on the plane where the creature's deity resides. If the creature didn't worship a deity, its soul departs to the plane corresponding to its alignment. Bringing someone back from the dead means retrieving the soul from that plane and returning it to its body.": "当一个生物死亡时，它的灵魂会离开它的身体，离开物质界，穿越星界，并去居住在该生物的神灵所在的位面。如果该生物没有崇拜某个神灵，它的灵魂就会离开到与它的排列组合相对应的平面。让人起死回生意味着从那个位面取回灵魂并将其送回身体。",
	"Enemies can take steps to make it more difficult for a character to be returned from the dead. Keeping the body prevents others from using raise dead or resurrection to restore the slain character to life.": "敌人可以采取措施，使角色更难起死回生。保留尸体可以防止他人使用起死回生或复活术来恢复被杀角色的生命。",
	"A soul can't be returned to life if it doesn't wish to be. A soul knows the name, alignment, and patron deity (if any) of the character attempting to revive it and might refuse to return on that basis. For example, if the honorable knight Sturm Brightblade is slain and a high priestess of Takhisis (god of evil dragons) grabs his body, Sturm might not wish to be raised from the dead by her. Any attempts she makes to revive him automatically fail. If the evil cleric wants to revive Sturm to interrogate him, she needs to find some way to trick his soul, such as duping a good cleric into raising him and then capturing him once he is alive again.": "如果一个灵魂不希望被复活，它就不能被复活。灵魂知道试图让它复活的角色的名字、排列方式和守护神（如果有的话），并可能以此为由拒绝返回。例如，如果光荣的骑士Sturm Brightblade被杀，Takhisis（恶龙之神）的女祭司抓住了他的身体，Sturm可能不希望被她从死亡中复活。她想让他复活的任何尝试都会自动失败。如果邪恶教士想让斯图姆复活来审问他，她需要找到一些方法来欺骗他的灵魂，比如欺骗一个好教士让他复活，然后在他再次活着的时候抓住他。",
	"The world you create is the stage for the adventures you set in it. You don't have to give more thought to it than that. You can run adventures in an episodic format, with the characters as the only common element, and also weave themes throughout those adventures to build a greater saga of the characters' achievements in the world.": "你创造的世界是你在其中设置的冒险的舞台。你不需要考虑得更多。你可以以剧情的形式进行冒险，把人物作为唯一的共同元素，也可以把主题贯穿于这些冒险中，为人物在这个世界上的成就建立一个更大的传奇。",
	"Planning an entire campaign might seem like a daunting task, but you don't have to plot out every detail right from the start. You can start with the basics, running a few adventures, and think about larger plot lines you want to explore as the campaign progresses. You're free to add as much or as little detail as you wish.": "规划整个活动似乎是一项艰巨的任务，但你不必从一开始就规划出每个细节。你可以从最基本的开始，进行一些冒险，并考虑随着活动的进行，你想探索的更大的情节线。你可以根据自己的意愿自由地增加或减少细节。",
	"The start of a campaign resembles the start of an adventure. You want to jump quickly into the action, show the players that adventure awaits, and grab their attention right away. Give the players enough information to make them want to come back week after week to see how the story plays out.": "活动的开始类似于冒险的开始。你要迅速进入行动，让玩家看到冒险在等着他们，并立即抓住他们的注意力。给予玩家足够的信息，使他们愿意周而复始地回来看故事的发展。",
	"When you first start building your campaign, start small. The characters need to know only about the city, town, or village where they start the game, and perhaps the nearby dungeon. You might decide that the barony is at war with a nearby duchy, or that a distant forest is crawling with ettercaps and giant spiders, and you should note these things. But at the start of the game, the local area is enough to get the campaign off the ground. Follow these steps to create that local area:": "当你第一次开始建立你的活动时，从小处着手。角色们只需要知道他们开始游戏的城市、城镇或村庄，也许还有附近的地牢。你可能会决定男爵与附近的公国开战，或者远处的森林里爬满了伊特帽和巨型蜘蛛，你应该注意这些事情。但在游戏开始时，当地的区域就足以让战役开始了。按照这些步骤来创建这个本地区域。",
	"See the \"Settlements\" section earlier in this chapter for guidance on building this settlement. A small town or village at the edge of the wilderness serves as a fine home base in most D&D campaigns. Use a larger town or city if you want a campaign with urban adventuring.": "请参阅本章前面的 \"定居点 \"一节，以获得关于建立这种定居点的指导。在大多数D&D活动中，位于荒野边缘的小城镇或村庄是一个很好的大本营。如果你想在活动中进行城市冒险，就使用一个较大的城镇或城市。",
	"See \"Mapping the Campaign\" earlier in this chapter for guidance. Draw a map at province scale (1 hex = 1 mile) with the home base near the center. Fill in the area within a day's travel-about 25 to 30 miles-of the home base. Pepper it with two to four dungeons or similar adventure locales. An area that size is likely to have one to three additional settlements as well as the home base, so give thought to them as well.": "请参阅本章前面的 \"绘制战役地图 \"以获得指导。以省为单位绘制地图（1六角=1英里），大本营靠近中心。在大本营的一天行程内--大约25至30英里--填上该地区。用两到四个地牢或类似的冒险地点来填满它。这么大的一个区域，除了大本营之外，可能还有一到三个额外的定居点，所以也要考虑到它们。",
	"A single dungeon makes a good first adventure for most campaigns. See chapter 3, \"Creating Adventures,\" for guidance.": "对于大多数战役来说，单一的地牢是一个很好的第一次冒险。请参阅第3章，\"创建冒险\"，以获得指导。",
	"A home base provides a common starting location for the characters. This starting point might be the village where they grew up or a city that attracted them from points beyond. Or perhaps they begin the campaign in the dungeons of an evil baron's castle where they've been locked up for various reasons (legitimate or otherwise), throwing them into the midst of the adventure.": "大本营为人物提供了一个共同的起始地点。这个起点可能是他们长大的村庄，或者是一个吸引他们的城市。或者他们在邪恶的男爵城堡的地牢里开始活动，在那里他们因为各种原因（合法的或其他的）被关起来，把他们扔到冒险的中间。",
	"For each of these steps, give the locations only as much detail as they need. You don't need to identify every building in a village or label every street in a large city. If the characters start in the baron's dungeon, you'll need the details of this first adventure site, but you don't have to name all the baron's knights. Sketch out a simple map, think about the surrounding area, and consider whom the characters are most likely to interact with early in the campaign. Most important, visualize how this area fits into the theme and story you have in mind for your campaign. Then start working on your first adventure!": "对于这些步骤中的每一步，只需提供他们需要的细节。你不需要确定一个村庄的每一栋建筑，也不需要给大城市的每一条街道贴上标签。如果人物从男爵的地牢开始，你就需要这第一个冒险地点的细节，但你不必说出所有男爵的骑士。画出一张简单的地图，考虑一下周围的区域，并考虑人物在活动初期最可能与谁互动。最重要的是，想象一下这个地区如何与你心目中的活动主题和故事相适应。然后开始着手准备你的第一次冒险",
	"As you start to develop your campaign, you'll need to fill in the players on the basics. For easy distribution, compile essential information into a campaign handout. Such a handout typically includes the following material:": "当你开始发展你的活动时，你需要让玩家们了解基本情况。为了便于分发，将基本信息汇编成活动手册。这种讲义通常包括以下材料。",
	"Any restrictions or new options for character creation, such as new or prohibited races.": "创建角色的任何限制或新选项，如新的或禁止的种族。",
	"Any information in the backstory of your campaign that the characters would know about. If you have a theme or direction in mind for the campaign, this information could include seeds hinting at that focus.": "在你的活动的背景故事中，人物会知道的任何信息。如果你对运动有一个主题或方向的想法，这些信息可以包括暗示这一重点的种子。",
	"Basic information about the area where the characters are starting, such as the name of the town, important locations in and around it, prominent NPCs they'd know about, and perhaps rumors that point to trouble that's brewing.": "关于人物开始工作的地区的基本信息，例如城镇的名称、城镇内和周围的重要地点、他们所知道的著名NPC，也许还有指向正在酝酿的麻烦的传言。",
	"Keep this handout short and to the point. Two pages is a reasonable maximum. Even if you have a burst of creative energy that produces twenty pages of great background material, save it for your adventures. Let the players uncover the details gradually in play.": "这个讲义要简短而有针对性。两页是一个合理的上限。即使你的创意能量迸发，产生了20页的伟大背景材料，也要把它留给你的冒险。让玩家在游戏中逐渐发现这些细节。",
	"Once you've identified what your campaign is about, let the players help tell the story by deciding how their characters are involved. This is their opportunity to tie their characters' history and background to the campaign, and a chance for you to determine how the various elements of each character's background tie into the campaign's story. For example, what secret has the hermit character learned? What is the status of the noble character's family? What is the folk hero's destiny?": "一旦你确定了你的活动是关于什么的，就让玩家通过决定他们的角色如何参与来帮助讲述这个故事。这是他们将自己角色的历史和背景与活动联系起来的机会，也是你确定每个角色的背景的各种元素如何与活动的故事联系起来的机会。例如，隐士角色学到了什么秘密？贵族角色的家庭地位如何？民间英雄的命运是什么？",
	"Some players might have trouble coming up with ideas-not everyone is equally inventive. You can help spur their creativity with a few questions about their characters:": "有些玩家可能很难想出主意--不是每个人都有同样的创造力。你可以用几个关于他们角色的问题来帮助刺激他们的创造力。",
	"Are you a native, born and raised in the area? If so, who's your family? What's your current occupation?": "你是土生土长的本地人吗？如果是的话，你的家人是谁？你目前的职业是什么？",
	"Are you a recent arrival? Where did you come from? Why did you come to this area?": "你是最近才来的吗？你从哪里来？你为什么来到这个地区？",
	"Are you tied to any of the organizations or people involved in the events that kick off the campaign? Are they friends or enemies?": "你是否与任何参与启动活动的组织或人员有联系？他们是朋友还是敌人？",
	"Listen to the players' ideas, and say yes if you can. Even if you want all the characters to have grown up in the starting town, consider allowing a recent arrival or a transplant if the player's story is convincing enough. Suggest alterations to a character's story so it better fits your world, or weave the first threads of your campaign into that story.": "听取玩家的想法，如果可以的话，就答应他们。即使你想让所有的角色都在起始镇上长大，如果玩家的故事有足够的说服力，也可以考虑允许一个新来的或移植的角色。建议改变一个角色的故事，使其更适合你的世界，或者将你的活动的第一条线编入该故事。",
	"Backgrounds are designed to root player characters in the world, and creating new backgrounds is a great way to introduce players to the special features of your world. Backgrounds that have ties to particular cultures, organizations, and historical events from your campaign are particularly strong. Perhaps the priests of a certain religion live as beggars supported by a pious populace, singing the tales of their deity's exploits to entertain and enlighten the faithful. You could create a mendicant priest background (or modify the acolyte background) to reflect these qualities. It could include musical instrument proficiency, and its feature probably involves receiving hospitality from the faithful.": "背景的设计是为了让玩家角色扎根于这个世界，而创造新的背景是向玩家介绍你的世界特色的一个好方法。与特定的文化、组织和历史事件有联系的背景是非常重要的。也许某个宗教的牧师在虔诚的民众的支持下以乞丐的身份生活，唱着他们神灵的故事来娱乐和启迪信徒。你可以创建一个修行者牧师背景（或修改圣徒背景）来反映这些品质。它可以包括对乐器的精通，其特点可能涉及接受信徒的款待。",
	"Guidelines for creating a new background are provided in chapter 9, \"Dungeon Master's Workshop.\"": "第9章 \"地下城主工作室 \"中提供了创建新背景的指南。",
	"Significant events in the history of a fantasy world tend toward immense upheavals: wars that pit the forces of good against evil in an epic confrontation, natural disasters that lay waste to entire civilizations, invasions of vast armies or extra planar hordes, assassinations of world leaders. These world-shaking events title the chapters of history.": "奇幻世界历史上的重大事件往往是巨大的动荡：让正义力量与邪恶力量进行史诗般的对抗的战争，让整个文明遭到破坏的自然灾害，庞大军队或额外星球群的入侵，对世界领导人的暗杀。这些震撼世界的事件为历史的篇章命名。",
	"In a D&D game, such events provide the sparks that can ignite and sustain a campaign. The most common pitfall of serial stories without a set beginning, middle, and end is inertia. Like many television shows and comic-book series, a D&D campaign runs the risk of retreading the same ground long after the enjoyment's gone. Just as actors or writers drift away from those other mediums, so can players-the actors and writers of a D&D game. Games stagnate when the story meanders too long without a change in tone, when the same villains and similar adventures grow tiresome and predictable, and when the world doesn't change around the characters and in response to their actions.": "在D&D游戏中，这类事件提供了可以点燃和维持活动的火花。没有固定的开头、中间和结尾的连载故事最常见的陷阱是惯性。就像许多电视节目和漫画书系列一样，D&D活动有可能在乐趣消失很久之后重蹈覆辙。就像演员或编剧在其他媒介中渐行渐远一样，玩家--D&D游戏的演员和编剧也会如此。当故事蜿蜒过久而没有语气变化时，当相同的反派和类似的冒险变得令人厌烦和可预测时，当世界没有围绕人物和对他们的行为作出反应而变化时，游戏就会停滞不前。",
	"World-shaking events force conflict. They set new events and power groups in motion. Their outcomes change the world by altering the tone of the setting in a meaningful way. They chronicle the story of your world in big, bold print. Change-especially change that occurs as a result of the characters' actions-keeps the story moving. If change is imperceptible, the actions of the characters lack significance. When the world becomes reliable, it's time to shake things up.": "震惊世界的事件迫使人们发生冲突。它们使新的事件和权力集团开始运作。它们的结果以一种有意义的方式改变了环境的基调，从而改变了世界。它们用大而粗的字体记录了你的世界的故事。变化--特别是由于人物的行动而发生的变化--使故事不断发展。如果变化是不可察觉的，人物的行动就缺乏意义。当世界变得可靠时，是时候让事情发生变化了。",
	"World-shaking events can happen at any time in a campaign or story arc, but the biggest incidents naturally fall at the beginning, middle, and end of a story.": "震撼世界的事件可以发生在战役或故事弧的任何时候，但最大的事件自然是发生在故事的开头、中间和结尾。",
	"That placement reflects the structure of dramatic stories. At the beginning of a story, something happens to shake the protagonists' world and spur them into action. The characters take action to resolve their problems, but other forces oppose them. As they reach a significant milestone toward their goal, a major conflict disrupts the characters' plans, shaking their world again; failure seems imminent. At the end of the story, they succeed or fail, and the world is shaken again by the way the characters changed it for good or ill.": "这一安排反映了戏剧性故事的结构。在一个故事的开头，发生了一些事情，动摇了主人公的世界，刺激他们采取行动。人物采取行动解决他们的问题，但其他力量反对他们。当他们朝着自己的目标达到一个重要的里程碑时，一场重大冲突打乱了人物的计划，再次动摇了他们的世界；失败似乎迫在眉睫。在故事的结尾，他们或成功或失败，世界因人物改变世界的方式而再次动摇，无论好坏。",
	"At the beginning of a D&D campaign, world-shaking events create instant adventure hooks and affect the characters' lives directly. In the middle, they make great turning points as the characters' fortunes reverse-rising after a defeat or falling after a victory. Near the end of a campaign, such events serve as excellent climactic episodes with far-reaching effects. They might even occur after the story has ended, as a result of the characters' actions.": "在D&D战役的开始阶段，震撼世界的事件创造了即时的冒险钩子，并直接影响到人物的生活。在中期，当人物的命运发生逆转时，它们会成为伟大的转折点--失败后上升或胜利后下降。在战役接近尾声时，这些事件会成为具有深远影响的出色的高潮情节。它们甚至可以在故事结束后发生，作为人物行动的结果。",
	"In constructing a narrative, beware of \"false action,\" or action for its own sake. False action doesn't move a story forward, engage characters, or cause them to change. Many action movies suffer from false action, in which car chases, gunfights, and explosions abound but do little more than inconvenience the characters and eventually bore the audience with their repetition and dearth of meaningful stakes. Some D&D campaigns fall into the same trap, stringing world-spanning disasters together one after another with little impact on the characters or the world. Thus, it's probably not in the DM's best interest to reorder the world every single time there's a lull in the action, lest world-shaking events become ordinary.": "在构建叙事时，要注意 \"虚假的行动\"，或为了行动而行动。虚假的行动不能推动故事的发展，不能吸引人物，也不能使他们改变。许多动作片都有假动作的问题，其中追车、枪战和爆炸比比皆是，但除了给角色带来不便外，最终会因为重复和缺乏有意义的赌注而使观众感到厌烦。一些D&D活动也落入了同样的陷阱，把跨越世界的灾难一个接一个地串起来，但对人物和世界的影响却很小。因此，每当行动暂停时，重新安排世界秩序可能不符合DM的最佳利益，以免震惊世界的事件变得平凡。",
	"As a general rule, a campaign can sustain up to three large-scale, world-shaking events: one near the beginning, one near the middle, and one near the end. Use as many small-scale events that disturb the bounded microcosms of towns, villages, tribes, fiefs, duchies, provinces, and so forth as you like. Every significant event shakes someone's world, after all, no matter how small that world might be. Let unexpected and terrible events regularly afflict the world's smaller territories, but unless your story demands it, save the large-scale map-spanning events for the biggest, most important moments of your campaign.": "一般来说，一场战役最多可以维持三个大规模的、震惊世界的事件：一个在开始，一个在中间，一个在结束。如果你愿意的话，可以使用尽可能多的小规模事件来扰乱城镇、村庄、部落、封地、公国、省等有界的微观世界。毕竟，每个重大事件都会撼动某人的世界，无论这个世界有多小。让出乎意料的可怕事件经常困扰着世界上较小的领土，但除非你的故事需要它，否则请将大规模的跨越地图的事件留给你的活动中最大、最重要的时刻。",
	"You can use this section for ideas and inspiration to expand on world-shaking events already occurring (or soon to occur) within your world. Alternatively, you can roll on the tables below to randomly generate an event to inspire your imagination.

	"Earthquake, famine, fire, plague, flood-disasters on a grand scale can eradicate whole civilizations without warning. Natural (or magical) catastrophes redraw maps, destroy economies, and alter worlds. Sometimes the survivors rebuild from the ruins. The Great Chicago Fire, for instance, provided an opportunity to rebuild the city according to a modern plan. Most of the time the disaster leaves only ruins-buried under ash like Pompeii, or sunk beneath the waves like Atlantis.": "地震、饥荒、火灾、瘟疫、洪水--这些大规模的灾难可以毫无征兆地消灭整个文明。自然（或魔法）灾难会重新绘制地图，破坏经济，改变世界。有时，幸存者会在废墟上重建。例如，芝加哥大火提供了一个按照现代计划重建城市的机会。大多数时候，灾难只留下废墟--像庞贝那样埋在灰烬之下，或者像亚特兰蒂斯那样沉入海浪之下。",

	"With two exceptions, the disasters on the table resemble those that affect our own world. Think of planar warps and magic gone awry like nuclear incidents; they're big events that unnaturally alter the land and its people. For example, in the Eberron campaign setting, a magical catastrophe lays waste to an entire country, transforming it into a hostile wasteland and ending the Last War.": "除了两个例外，桌子上的灾难与影响我们自己世界的灾难相似。把平面扭曲和魔法出错想象成核事故；它们是不自然地改变土地和人民的大事件。例如，在Eberron战役设定中，一场魔法灾难将整个国家夷为平地，将其变成一片充满敌意的荒地，并结束了最后的战争。",
	"Divine judgment is something else entirely. This disaster takes whatever form you want, but it's always a big, bold, unsubtle sign of a deity's displeasure.": "神圣的审判则完全是另一回事。这种灾难采取任何你想要的形式，但它总是一个巨大的、大胆的、不含糊的神灵不悦的标志。",
	"You might decide to wipe a town, region, or nation off the map of your world. A disaster ravages the land and effectively eliminates a place the characters once knew.": "你可能决定将一个城镇、地区或国家从你的世界地图上抹去。一场灾难蹂躏了这片土地，有效地消除了角色们曾经熟悉的地方。",

On the other hand, an assault might be the first step of an invasion.": "入侵是最常见的震惊世界的事件之一，当一个团体强行接管另一个团体时，通常是通过军事力量，但也可以通过渗透和占领。攻击与入侵的不同之处在于，攻击部队不一定对占领或夺取政权感兴趣。另一方面，袭击可能是入侵的第一步。",
	"Regardless of the scale, a world-shaking assault or invasion stands out because its repercussions change the characters' world, and its effects echo long after the initial attack or takeover.": "无论规模大小，震撼世界的攻击或入侵都会脱颖而出，因为它的反响改变了人物的世界，其影响在最初的攻击或接管后还会长期存在。",

	"The scale of a revolution need not involve the common masses against the nobility. A revolution can be as small as a merchants' guild revolting against its leadership or a temple overthrowing its priesthood in favor of a new creed. The spirits of the forest might attempt to overthrow the forces of civilization in a nearby city that cut down trees for timber. Alternatively, the scale can be as dramatic as humanity rising to overthrow the gods.": "革命的规模不需要涉及普通群众反对贵族。一场革命可以小到一个商人公会反抗其领导层，或者一个寺庙推翻其神职人员以支持一个新的信条。森林之灵可能会试图推翻附近城市的文明力量，这些文明力量砍伐树木作为木材。另外，其规模可以是戏剧性的，如人类起来推翻诸神。",

If the old order remains in power, describe one way that its leaders punish the revolutionaries.": "说明旧秩序下台后所付出的代价。在下一个政权中，前权力集团中是否有人继续掌权？如果旧秩序继续执政，请描述其领导人惩罚革命者的一种方式。",

If they discover a new mineral with magical properties, map a new land that's eminently suitable for colonization, or uncover an ancient weapon with the power to wreak devastation on your world, they are likely to set major events in motion. This gives the players the opportunity to see exactly how much influence their actions have on your world.": "当你的活动中的冒险者是发现者的时候，一个发现就特别令人印象深刻。如果他们发现了一种具有神奇特性的新矿物，绘制了一块非常适合殖民的新土地，或者发现了一种具有对你的世界造成破坏的古老武器，他们就有可能启动重大事件。这让玩家有机会看到他们的行为对你的世界到底有多大的影响。",

Other holy days are important only to people particularly devoted to a single deity. Still others are observed by priests, who perform private rites and sacrifices inside their temples on certain days or specific times of day. And some holy days are local, observed by the faithful of a specific temple.": "某些圣日是公民活动，在有神庙的城镇中，每个公民都会遵守。收获节通常是大规模的庆祝活动。其他圣日只对那些对某一神灵特别虔诚的人很重要。还有一些圣日是由祭司纪念的，他们在特定的日子或一天中的特定时间在他们的寺庙里进行私人仪式和祭祀。还有一些圣日是地方性的，由某一特定寺庙的信众来纪念。",
	"Give some thought to how priests and common folk celebrate holy days. Going into a temple, sitting in a pew, and listening to a sermon is a mode of worship foreign to most fantasy religions. More commonly, celebrants offer sacrifices to their gods. The faithful bring animals to the temple to be slaughtered or burn incense as an offering. The wealthiest citizens bring the largest animals, to flaunt their wealth and demonstrate their piety. People pour out libations at the graves of their ancestors. They spend all-night vigils in darkened shrines or enjoy splendid feasts celebrating a god's bounty.": "对牧师和普通人如何庆祝圣日进行一些思考。进入寺庙，坐在座椅上，听着布道，是大多数幻想中的宗教所不具备的崇拜模式。更常见的是，庆祝者向他们的神灵献上祭品。信徒们把动物带到寺庙里宰杀，或烧香作为祭品。最富有的公民会带来最大的动物，以炫耀他们的财富并证明他们的虔诚。人们在祖先的坟墓前倾倒酒水。他们在黑暗的神殿中通宵守夜，或享受庆祝神灵恩赐的华丽盛宴。",
	"Holy days provide the majority of the special celebrations in most calendars, but local or national festivals account for many others. The birthday of a monarch, the anniversary of a great victory in a war, craft festivals, market days, and similar events all provide excuses for local celebrations.": "在大多数日历中，圣日提供了大部分特殊的庆祝活动，但地方或国家节日则占了许多其他节日。君主的生日、战争的伟大胜利纪念日、手工艺节、集市日以及类似的活动都为地方庆祝活动提供了借口。",
	"Since your setting is a fantasy world and not a mundane medieval society, add in a few events of an obviously magical nature. For example, perhaps a ghostly castle appears on a certain hill on the winter solstice every year, or every third full moon fills lycanthropes with a particularly strong bloodlust. Also, the thirteenth night of every month could mark the ghostly wanderings of a long-forgotten nomadic tribe.": "由于你的设定是一个幻想世界，而不是一个平凡的中世纪社会，所以要加入一些明显具有魔法性质的事件。例如，也许在每年的冬至日，某座山上会出现一座幽灵般的城堡，或者每三个满月都会让狼人充满特别强烈的嗜血欲望。另外，每个月的第十三夜可能标志着一个早已被遗忘的游牧部落的幽灵般的游荡。",
	"Extraordinary events, such as the approach of a comet or a lunar eclipse, make good adventure elements, and you can drop them in your calendar wherever you want. Your calendar can tell you when there's a full moon for a lunar eclipse, but you can always fudge the date for a particular effect.": "非同寻常的事件，如彗星的接近或月食，都是很好的冒险元素，你可以把它们放在你的日历上，只要你想。你的日历可以告诉你什么时候有月圆的月食，但你总是可以为了特定的效果而伪造日期。",
	"The world of the Forgotten Realms uses the Calendar of Harptos, named after the long-dead wizard who invented it. Each year of 365 days is divided into twelve months of thirty days each, which roughly correspond to months in the real-world Gregorian calendar. Each month is divided into three tendays. Five special holidays fall between the months and mark the seasons. Another special holiday, Shieldmeet, is inserted into the calendar after Midsummer every four years, much like leap years in the modern Gregorian calendar.": "被遗忘的世界使用哈普托斯日历，以发明该日历的已故巫师的名字命名。每年365天分为12个月，每个月30天，与现实世界的公历中的月份大致对应。每个月又分为三个工作日。在各月之间有五个特殊节日，标志着季节的变化。另一个特殊的节日，Shieldmeet，每四年在仲夏节后插入日历中，很像现代公历的闰年。",

	"A campaign's ending should tie up all the threads of its beginning and middle, but you don't have to take a campaign all the way to 20th level for it to be satisfying. Wrap up the campaign whenever your story reaches its natural conclusion. Make sure you allow space and time near the end of your campaign for the characters to finish up any personal goals. Their own stories need to end in a satisfying way, just as the campaign story does. Ideally, some of the characters' individual goals will be fulfilled by the ultimate goal of the final adventure. Give characters with unfinished goals a chance to finish them before the very end.": "一场战役的结局应该把开头和中间的所有线索串联起来，但你不必把一场战役一直进行到第20关才算满意。只要你的故事达到了自然的结论，就可以结束这个活动。确保你在战役结束前留出空间和时间，让角色完成任何个人目标。他们自己的故事需要以一种令人满意的方式结束，就像竞选故事一样。理想情况下，一些角色的个人目标将通过最后的冒险的最终目标得到实现。给有未完成目标的角色一个机会，让他们在最后之前完成这些目标。",
	"Once the campaign has ended, a new one can begin. If you intend to run a new campaign for the same group of players, using their previous characters' actions as the basis of legends gives them immediate investment in the new setting. Let the new characters experience how the world has changed because of their old characters. In the end, though, the new campaign is a new story with new protagonists. They shouldn't have to share the spotlight with the heroes of days gone by.": "一旦活动结束，新的活动就可以开始了。如果你打算为同一批玩家开展新的战役，用他们以前的角色的行为作为传说的基础，让他们立即投入到新的环境中。让新角色体验一下这个世界是如何因为他们的旧角色而改变的。不过，归根结底，新的活动是一个新的故事，有新的主角。他们不应该与过去的英雄们分享聚光灯。",
	"By building a new world (or adopting an existing one) and creating the key events that launch your campaign, you determined what your campaign is about. Next, you have to decide how you want to run your campaign.": "通过建立一个新的世界（或采用一个现有的世界）和创建启动你的运动的关键事件，你确定了你的运动是关于什么。接下来，你必须决定你要如何开展你的活动。",
	"What's the right way to run a campaign? That depends on your play style and the motivations of your players. Consider your players' tastes, your strengths as a DM, table rules (discussed in part 3), and the type of game you want to run. Describe to the players how you envision the game experience and let them give you input. The game is theirs, too. Lay that groundwork early, so your players can make informed choices and help you maintain the type of game you want to run. Consider the following two exaggerated examples of play style.": "什么是开展活动的正确方式？这取决于你的游戏风格和你的玩家的动机。考虑你的玩家的口味、你作为DM的优势、表格规则（在第三部分讨论）以及你想运行的游戏类型。向玩家描述你所设想的游戏体验，让他们给你提供意见。游戏也是他们的。尽早打好基础，这样你的玩家就能做出明智的选择，并帮助你保持你想运行的游戏类型。请考虑以下两个夸张的游戏风格的例子。",
	"The adventurers kick in the dungeon door, fight the monsters, and grab the treasure. This style of play is straightforward, fun, exciting, and action-oriented. The players spend relatively little time developing personas for their characters, roleplaying noncombat situations or discussing anything other than the immediate dangers of the dungeon.": "冒险家们踢开地牢的门，与怪物搏斗，抢夺财宝。这种游戏风格是直接的、有趣的、令人兴奋的和面向行动的。玩家很少花时间为自己的角色塑造形象，在非战斗情况下进行角色扮演，或者讨论除了地牢中的直接危险之外的其他事情。",
	"In such a game, the adventurers face clearly evil monsters and opponents and occasionally meet clearly good and helpful NPCs. Don't expect the adventurers to anguish over what to do with prisoners, or to debate whether it's right or wrong to invade and wipe out a bugbear lair. Don't track money or time spent in town. Once they've completed a task, send the adventurers back into the action as quickly as possible. Character motivation need be no more developed than a desire to kill monsters and acquire treasure.": "在这样的游戏中，冒险者面对的是明显邪恶的怪物和对手，偶尔也会遇到明显善良和有帮助的NPC。不要指望冒险家们为如何处理俘虏而苦恼，或者争论入侵和消灭一个虫族巢穴是对还是错。不要跟踪金钱或在城里花费的时间。一旦他们完成了一项任务，就尽快让冒险家们回到行动中去。角色的动机不需要比杀死怪物和获得宝藏的愿望更多。",
	"Waterdeep is threatened by political turmoil. The adventurers must convince the Masked Lords, the city's secret rulers, to resolve their differences, but can do so only after both the characters and the lords have come to terms with their differing outlooks and agendas. This style of gaming is deep, complex, and challenging. The focus isn't on combat but on negotiations, political maneuverings, and character interaction. A whole game session might pass without a single attack roll.": "水底世界受到了政治动荡的威胁。冒险家们必须说服城市的秘密统治者--假面领主解决他们的分歧，但只有在人物和领主都接受了他们不同的观点和议程之后才能做到这一点。这种游戏风格是深刻、复杂和具有挑战性的。重点不是战斗，而是谈判、政治操纵和角色互动。整个游戏过程中，可能没有一次攻击卷。",
	"In this style of game, the NPCs are as complex and richly detailed as the adventurers, although the focus lies on motivation and personality, not game statistics. Expect long digressions from each player about what his or her character does, and why. Going to a temple to ask a priest for advice can be as important an encounter as fighting orcs. (And don't expect the adventurers to fight the orcs at all unless they are motivated to do so.) A character will sometimes take actions against the player's better judgment, because \"that's what the character would do.\" Since combat isn't the focus, game rules take a back seat to character development. Ability check modifiers and skill proficiencies take precedence over combat bonuses. Feel free to change or ignore rules to fit the players' roleplaying needs, using the advice presented in part 3 of this book.": "在这种风格的游戏中，NPC和冒险者一样复杂和丰富的细节，尽管重点在于动机和个性，而不是游戏统计。希望每个玩家都能对他或她的角色所做的事情以及为什么要这样做进行长篇大论。去寺庙向牧师请教可以是与兽人作战一样重要的遭遇。(除非冒险者有动机，否则不要指望他们会去打兽人）。角色有时会采取违背玩家更好判断的行动，因为 \"那是角色会做的事\"。由于战斗不是重点，游戏规则在角色发展中处于次要地位。能力检查修改器和技能熟练度优先于战斗奖励。根据本书第三部分的建议，可以随意改变或忽略规则，以适应玩家的角色扮演需要。",
	"The style of play in most campaigns falls between these two extremes. There's plenty of action, but the campaign offers an ongoing storyline and interaction between characters as well. Players develop their characters' motivations and relish the chance to prove their skills in combat. To maintain the balance, provide a mixture of roleplaying encounters and combat encounters. Even in a dungeon setting, you can present NPCs that aren't meant to be fought but rather helped out, negotiated with, or just talked to.": "大多数战役的游戏风格介于这两个极端之间。这里有大量的行动，但战役也提供了一个持续的故事情节和人物之间的互动。玩家发展他们的角色的动机，并乐于在战斗中证明他们的技能。为了保持平衡，要提供角色扮演的遭遇和战斗遭遇的混合物。即使是在地牢中，你也可以提供一些不是用来战斗的NPC，而是用来帮助他们，与他们谈判，或者只是与他们交谈。",
	"Think about your preferred style of play by considering these questions:": "通过考虑这些问题，思考你喜欢的游戏风格。",
	"Are you a fan of realism and gritty consequences, or are you more focused on making the game seem like an action movie?": "你是喜欢现实主义和狡猾的后果，还是更注重让游戏看起来像一部动作电影？",
	"Do you want the game to maintain a sense of medieval fantasy, or do you want to explore alternate time lines or modern thinking?": "你想让游戏保持一种中世纪的幻想感，还是想探索另一种时间线或现代思维？",
	"Do you want to maintain a serious tone, or is humor your goal?": "你是想保持严肃的语气，还是以幽默为目标？",
	"Even if you are serious, is the action lighthearted or intense?": "即使你是认真的，行动是轻松的还是激烈的？",
	"Is bold action key, or do the players need to be thoughtful and cautious?": "大胆的行动是关键，还是玩家需要深思熟虑，小心翼翼？",
	"Do you like to plan thoroughly in advance, or do you prefer improvising on the spot?": "你喜欢提前做好周密的计划，还是喜欢在现场即兴发挥？",
	"Is the game full of varied D&D elements, or does it center on a theme such as horror?": "游戏是充满了各种D&D元素，还是以一个主题为中心，比如说恐怖？",
	"Is the game for all ages, or does it involve mature themes?": "该游戏是否适合所有年龄段的人，或者是否涉及成熟的主题？",
	"Are you comfortable with moral ambiguity, such as allowing the characters to explore whether the end justifies the means? Or are you happier with straightforward heroic principles, such as justice, sacrifice, and helping the downtrodden?": "你是否对道德模糊性感到满意，比如允许人物探索目的是否能证明手段的正确性？或者你更喜欢直截了当的英雄主义原则，如正义、牺牲和帮助被压迫者？",
	"Much of a campaign involves the adventurers traveling from place to place, exploring the environment, and learning about the fantasy world. This exploration can take place in any environment, including a vast wilderness, a labyrinthine dungeon, the shadowy passages of the Underdark, the crowded streets of a city, and the undulating waters of the sea. Determining a way around an obstacle, finding a hidden object, investigating a strange feature of a dungeon, deciphering clues, solving puzzles, and bypassing or disabling traps can all be part of exploration.": "活动的大部分内容是冒险者从一个地方到另一个地方，探索环境，了解奇幻世界。这种探索可以在任何环境中进行，包括广阔的荒野、迷宫般的地牢、暗黑世界的阴暗通道、城市中拥挤的街道以及海洋中起伏的水域。确定绕过障碍物的方法、寻找隐藏的物体、调查地牢的奇怪特征、破译线索、解决谜题、绕过或解除陷阱都可以是探索的一部分。",
	"Sometimes exploration is an incidental part of the game. For instance, you might gloss over an unimportant journey by telling the players that they spend three uneventful days on the road before moving along to the next point of interest. Other times exploration is the focus, a chance to describe a wondrous part of the world or story that increases the players' feeling of immersion. Similarly, you should consider playing up exploration if your players enjoy solving puzzles, finding their way around obstacles, and searching dungeon corridors for secret doors.": "有时，探索是游戏的一个附带部分。例如，你可能会通过告诉玩家他们在路上花了三天的时间来掩盖一个不重要的旅程，然后再继续前进到下一个兴趣点。其他时候，探索是重点，是描述世界或故事中奇妙部分的一个机会，可以增加玩家的沉浸感。同样，如果你的玩家喜欢解开谜题，找到绕过障碍物的方法，并在地下城的走廊里寻找秘密的门，你就应该考虑加强探索。",
	"Part of your campaign style has to do with naming characters. It's a good idea to establish some ground rules with your players at the start of a new campaign. In a group consisting of Sithis, Travok, Anastrianna, and Kairon, the human fighter named Bob II sticks out, especially when he's identical to Bob I, who was killed by kobolds. If everyone takes a lighthearted approach to names, that's fine. If the group would rather take the characters and their names a little more seriously, urge Bob's player to come up with a more appropriate name.": "你的活动风格的一部分与角色的命名有关。在新的战役开始时与你的玩家建立一些基本规则是个好主意。在一个由Sithis、Travok、Anastrianna和Kairon组成的团体中，名为Bob II的人类战士很引人注目，尤其是当他与被哥布林杀死的Bob I相同时。如果每个人都对名字采取轻松的态度，这很好。如果大家宁愿把人物和他们的名字看得更严肃一点，就敦促鲍勃的玩家想出一个更合适的名字。",
	"Player character names should match each other in flavor or concept, and they should also match the flavor of your campaign world-so should the nonplayer characters' names and place names you create. Travok and Kairon don't want to undertake a quest for Lord Cupcake, visit Gumdrop Island, or take down a crazy wizard named Ray.": "玩家角色的名字应该在风味或概念上相互匹配，它们也应该与你的战役世界的风味相匹配--你创造的非玩家角色的名字和地名也应该如此。Travok和Kairon不想为Cupcake勋爵做任务，不想访问Gumdrop岛，也不想打倒一个叫Ray的疯狂巫师。",
	"The backbone of a campaign is a connected series of adventures, but you can connect them in two different ways. In a continuing campaign, the connected adventures share a sense of a larger purpose or a recurring theme (or themes). The adventures might feature returning villains, grand conspiracies, or a single mastermind who's ultimately behind every adventure of the campaign.": "活动的主干是一系列相连的冒险，但你可以用两种不同的方式来连接它们。在一个持续的战役中，相连的冒险有一个更大的目的或一个反复出现的主题（或多个主题）的感觉。这些冒险可能以回归的恶棍、大阴谋或一个最终在活动的每个冒险背后的单一主谋为特征。",
	"A continuing campaign designed with a theme and a story arc in mind can feel like a great fantasy epic. The players derive the satisfaction of knowing the actions they take during one adventure matter in the next. Plotting and running that kind of campaign can be demanding on the DM, but the payoff is a great and memorable story.": "一个以主题和故事梗概为基础设计的持续活动，可以让人感觉像一部伟大的奇幻史诗。玩家可以获得满足感，知道他们在一次冒险中采取的行动在下一次冒险中很重要。策划和运行这样的活动对管理员的要求很高，但回报是一个伟大而令人难忘的故事。",
	"An episodic campaign, in contrast, is like a television show where each week's episode is a self-contained story that doesn't play into any overarching plot. It might be built on a premise that explains its nature: the player characters are adventurers-for-hire, or explorers venturing into the unknown and facing a string of unrelated dangers. They might even be archaeologists, venturing into one ancient ruin after another in search of artifacts. An episodic game like this lets you create adventures-or buy published ones-and drop them into your campaign without worrying about how they fit with the adventures that came before and follow after.": "相比之下，剧情式活动就像一个电视节目，每周的剧集都是一个自成一体的故事，并不涉及任何总体情节。它可能建立在一个解释其性质的前提上：玩家角色是雇佣的冒险家，或者是进入未知世界的探险家，面临一连串不相关的危险。他们甚至可能是考古学家，冒险进入一个又一个古代遗迹寻找文物。像这样的剧情游戏可以让你创造冒险，或者购买已出版的冒险，并将它们放入你的活动中，而不必担心它们与之前和之后的冒险如何配合。",
	"A theme in a campaign, as in a work of literature, expresses the deeper meaning of a story and the fundamental elements of human experience that the story explores. Your campaign doesn't have to be a work of literature, but it can still draw on common themes that lend a distinctive flavor to its stories. Consider these examples:": "活动中的主题，如同文学作品中的主题，表达了故事的深层含义，以及故事所探讨的人类经验的基本要素。你的活动不一定要成为一部文学作品，但它仍然可以借鉴常见的主题，使其故事具有独特的风味。考虑一下这些例子。",
	"A campaign about confronting the inevitability of mortality, whether embodied in undead monsters or expressed through the death of loved ones.": "一场关于面对死亡的不可避免性的运动，无论是体现在不死的怪物身上，还是通过亲人的死亡来表达。",
	"A campaign revolving around an insidious evil, whether dark gods, monstrous races such as the yuan-ti, or creatures of unknown realms far removed from mortal concerns. As heroes confront this evil, they must face the selfish, cold tendencies of their own kind as well.": "一个围绕着阴险邪恶的活动，无论是黑暗的神，还是像元始天尊这样的畸形种族，或是远离凡间的未知领域的生物。当英雄们面对这种邪恶时，他们也必须面对自己同类的自私、冷酷的倾向。",
	"A campaign featuring troubled heroes who confront not only the savagery of the bestial creatures of the world, but also the beast within-the rage and fury that lies in their own hearts.": "这场战役的特点是麻烦的英雄们不仅要面对世界上兽性生物的野蛮，还要面对内心的野兽--隐藏在他们自己心中的怒火和狂暴。",
	"A campaign exploring the insatiable thirst for power and domination, whether embodied by the hosts of the Nine Hells or by humanoid rulers bent on conquering the world.": "这是一场探索对权力和统治永不满足的渴求的运动，无论是九层地狱的主人还是一心想征服世界的人形统治者都体现了这一点。",
	"With a theme such as \"confrontation with mortality,\" you can craft a broad range of adventures that aren't necessarily connected by a common villain. One adventure might feature the dead bursting from their graves and threatening to overwhelm a whole town. In the next adventure, a mad wizard creates a flesh golem in an effort to revive his lost love. A villain could go to extreme lengths to achieve immortality to avoid confronting its own demise. The adventurers might help a ghost accept death and move on, or one of the adventurers might even become a ghost!": "有了 \"与死亡对抗 \"这样的主题，你就可以设计出一系列广泛的冒险，而这些冒险并不一定由一个共同的恶棍来连接。一个冒险的特点可能是死人从坟墓里冲出来，威胁着整个城镇。在下一个冒险中，一个疯狂的巫师创造了一个肉体傀儡，以努力使他失去的爱情复活。一个坏蛋可能为了避免面对自己的死亡而不惜采取极端的手段来实现永生。冒险家们可能会帮助一个鬼魂接受死亡并继续前进，或者其中一个冒险家甚至可能成为一个鬼魂!",
	"Mixing things up once in a while allows your players to enjoy a variety of adventures. Even a tightly themed campaign can stray now and then. If your campaign heavily involves intrigue, mystery, and roleplaying, your players might enjoy the occasional dungeon crawl—especially if the tangent is revealed to relate to a larger plot in the campaign. If most of your adventures are dungeon expeditions, shift gears with a tense urban mystery that eventually leads the party into a dungeon crawl in an abandoned building or tower. If you run horror adventures week after week, try using a villain who turns out to be ordinary, perhaps even silly. Comic relief is a great variation on almost any D&D campaign, though players usually provide it themselves.": "偶尔混合一下，可以让你的玩家享受各种冒险的乐趣。即使是一个主题紧密的活动，也可以时不时地偏离一下。如果你的活动主要涉及阴谋、神秘和角色扮演，你的玩家可能会喜欢偶尔在地牢里爬一爬--特别是如果这个切入点被发现与活动中的大情节有关。如果你的大部分冒险都是地牢探险，那就用一个紧张的城市之谜来转移注意力，最终引导玩家在废弃的建筑或塔中进行地牢爬行。如果你周而复始地进行恐怖冒险，可以尝试使用一个原来很普通，甚至可能很愚蠢的反派。在几乎所有的D&D活动中，喜剧都是一个很好的变化，尽管玩家通常会自己提供。",
	"As characters grow in power, their ability to change the world around them grows with them. It helps to think ahead when creating your campaign to account for this change. As the characters make a greater impact on the world, they face greater danger whether they want to or not. Powerful factions see them as a threat and plot against them, while friendly ones court their favor in hopes of striking a useful alliance.": "随着角色力量的增长，他们改变周围世界的能力也会随之增长。在创建活动时，提前考虑到这种变化是有帮助的。随着人物对世界产生更大的影响，无论他们是否愿意，他们都会面临更大的危险。强大的派别将他们视为威胁，并策划反对他们，而友好的派别则向他们示好，希望能达成有用的联盟。",
	"The tiers of play represent the ideal milestones for introducing new world-shaking events to the campaign. As the characters resolve one event, a new danger arises or the prior trouble transforms into a new threat in response to the characters' actions. Events need to grow in magnitude and scope, increasing the stakes and drama as the characters become increasingly powerful.": "游戏的层级代表了为战役引入新的震惊世界的事件的理想里程碑。当人物解决一个事件时，新的危险就会出现，或者之前的麻烦会因为人物的行动而转化为新的威胁。事件的规模和范围需要不断扩大，随着人物变得越来越强大，赌注和戏剧性也在增加。",
	"This approach also allows you to break your design work down into smaller pieces. Create material such as adventures, NPCs, maps, and so on for one tier at a time. You only need to worry about the details of the next tier as the characters approach it. Even better, as the campaign takes unexpected turns in response to the players' choices, you don't have to worry about redoing much work.": "这种方法也允许你把设计工作分成小块。一次为一个层级创建材料，如冒险、NPC、地图等等。你只需要在人物接近下一层的时候担心下一层的细节问题。更妙的是，当活动因玩家的选择而出现意想不到的转折时，你就不必担心重做很多工作了。",
	"Characters in this tier are still learning the range of class features that define them, including their choice of specialization. But even 1st-level characters are heroes, set apart from the common people by natural characteristics, learned skills, and the hint of a greater destiny that lies before them.": "这个层次的角色仍在学习定义他们的一系列等级特征，包括他们对专业的选择。但是，即使是一级角色也是英雄，通过自然特征、学习的技能和摆在他们面前的更大的命运的暗示而与普通人区分开来。",
	"At the start of their careers, characters use 1st- and 2nd-level spells and wield mundane gear. The magic items they find include common consumable items (potions and scrolls) and a very few uncommon permanent items. Their magic can have a big impact in a single encounter, but it doesn't change the course of an adventure.": "在他们的职业生涯开始时，角色使用一级和二级法术，并挥舞着世俗的装备。他们找到的魔法物品包括普通的消耗品（药水和卷轴）和极少数不常见的永久性物品。他们的魔法可以在一次遭遇战中产生很大的影响，但它不会改变冒险的进程。",
	"The fate of a village might hang on the success or failure of low-level adventurers, who trust their lives to their fledgling abilities. These characters navigate dangerous terrain and explore haunted crypts, where they can expect to fight savage orcs, ferocious wolves, giant spiders, evil cultists, bloodthirsty ghouls, and hired thugs. If they face even a young dragon, they're better off avoiding a fight.": "一个村庄的命运可能取决于低级别的冒险者的成败，他们把自己的生命托付给刚起步的能力。这些角色在危险的地形上航行，探索闹鬼的地窖，他们可能会与野蛮的兽人、凶猛的狼、巨大的蜘蛛、邪恶的崇拜者、嗜血的食尸鬼和雇佣的暴徒战斗。如果他们面对的是一条年轻的龙，他们最好避免战斗。",
	"By the time they reach this tier, adventurers have mastered the basics of their class features, though they continue to improve throughout these levels. They have found their place in the world and have begun to involve themselves in the dangers that surround them.": "当他们达到这个等级时，冒险者已经掌握了他们等级特征的基本知识，尽管他们在这些等级中继续提高。他们已经找到了自己在这个世界上的位置，并开始参与到他们周围的危险中。",
	"Dedicated spellcasters learn 3rd-level spells at the start of this tier. Suddenly characters can fly, damage large numbers of foes with {@spell fireball} and {@spell lightning bolt} spells, and even breathe underwater. They master 5th-level spells by the end of the tier, and spells such as {@spell teleportation circle}, {@spell scrying}, {@spell flame strike}, {@spell legend lore}, and {@spell raise dead} can have a significant impact on their adventures. They start acquiring more permanent magic items (uncommon and rare ones) as well, which will serve them for the rest of their careers.": "专职的施法者在本层开始时学习第三级法术。突然间，人物可以飞行，用{@spell fireball}和{@spell lightning bolt}的法术伤害大量的敌人，甚至可以在水中呼吸。在本层结束时，他们掌握了五级法术，诸如{@spell teleportation circle}、{@spell scrying}、{@spell flame strike}、{@spell legend lore}和{@spell raise dead}等法术可以对他们的冒险产生重大影响。他们也开始获得更多的永久性魔法物品（不常见的和稀有的），这将为他们的职业生涯的其余部分服务。",
	"The fate of a region might depend on the adventures that characters of levels 5 to 10 undertake. These adventurers venture into fearsome wilds and ancient ruins, where they confront savage giants, ferocious hydras, fearless golems, evil yuan-ti, scheming devils, bloodthirsty demons, crafty mind flayers, and drow assassins. They might have a chance of defeating a young dragon that has established a lair but not yet extended its reach far into the surrounding territory.": "一个地区的命运可能取决于5到10级的人物所进行的冒险。这些冒险者冒险进入可怕的荒野和古老的遗迹，在那里他们面对野蛮的巨人、凶猛的水蛇、无畏的巨兽、邪恶的元神、阴险的魔鬼、嗜血的恶魔、狡猾的心灵传播者和乌鸦刺客。他们可能有机会打败一条年轻的龙，这条龙已经建立了一个巢穴，但还没有把它的触角延伸到周围的领土。",
	"By 11th level, characters are shining examples of courage and determination-true paragons in the world, set well apart from the masses. At this tier, adventurers are far more versatile than they were at lower levels, and they can usually find the right tool for a given challenge.": "到了第11级，人物是勇气和决心的光辉典范--世界上真正的典范，与众不同。在这个等级，冒险家们比低级别的冒险家们要多才多艺，他们通常可以找到合适的工具来应对特定的挑战。",
	"Dedicated spellcasters gain access to 6th-level spells at 11th level, including spells that completely change the way adventurers interact with the world. Their big, flashy spells are significant in combat-{@spell disintegrate}, {@spell blade barrier}, and {@spell heal}, for example-but behind-the-scenes spells such as {@spell word of recall}, {@spell find the path}, {@spell contingency}, {@spell teleport}, and {@spell true seeing} alter the way players approach their adventures. Each spell level after that point introduces new effects with an equally large impact. The adventurers find rare magic items (and very rare ones) that bestow similarly powerful abilities.": "专门的法术师在11级时可以获得6级法术，包括完全改变冒险者与世界互动方式的法术。他们的大而华丽的法术在战斗中很重要--例如{@spell disintegrate}、{@spell blade barrier}和{@spell heal}，但幕后的法术，如{@spell word of recall}、{@spell find the path}、{@spell contingency}、{@spell teleport}和{@spell true seeing}，则改变了玩家的冒险方式。这之后的每一个法术等级都会引入新的效果，影响同样巨大。冒险者们找到了罕见的魔法物品（和非常罕见的），赋予了类似的强大能力。",
	"The fate of a nation or even the world depends on momentous quests that such characters undertake. Adventurers explore uncharted regions and delve into long-forgotten dungeons, where they confront terrible masterminds of the lower planes, cunning rakshasas and beholders, and hungry purple worms. They might encounter and even defeat a powerful adult dragon that has established a lair and a significant presence in the world.": "一个国家甚至世界的命运取决于这些人物所承担的重大任务。冒险家们探索未知的地区，深入被遗忘已久的地牢，在那里他们要面对可怕的下层世界的主谋，狡猾的罗刹和持有者，以及饥饿的紫色蠕虫。他们可能会遇到，甚至打败一个强大的成年龙，它在这个世界上建立了一个巢穴和一个重要的存在。",
	"At this tier, adventurers make their mark on the world in a variety of ways, from the consequences of their adventures to the manner in which they spend their hard-won treasure and exploit their well-deserved reputations. Characters of this level construct fortresses on land deeded them by local rulers. They found guilds, temples, or martial orders. They take on apprentices or students of their own. They broker peace between nations or lead them into war. And their formidable reputations attract the attention of very powerful foes.": "在这个级别，冒险家们以各种方式在这个世界上留下自己的印记，从他们冒险的结果到他们花掉自己辛苦得来的财宝和利用自己当之无愧的声誉的方式。这个级别的人物在当地统治者授予他们的土地上建造堡垒。他们建立了行会、寺庙或武道会。他们收学徒或自己的学生。他们在国家之间斡旋和平，或将他们带入战争。他们强大的声誉吸引了非常强大的敌人的注意。",
	"By 17th level, characters have super heroic capabilities, and their deeds and adventures are the stuff of legend. Ordinary people can hardly dream of such heights of power-or such terrible dangers.": "到了17级，人物就有了超级英雄的能力，他们的事迹和冒险都是传说中的东西。普通人很难梦想到这样的力量高度--或者这样的可怕危险。",
	"Dedicated spellcasters at this tier wield earthshaking 9th-level spells such as {@spell wish}, {@spell gate}, {@spell storm of vengeance}, and {@spell astral projection}.

	"Adventures at these levels have far-reaching consequences, possibly determining the fate of millions in the Material Plane and even places beyond. Characters traverse otherworldly realms and explore demiplanes and other extraplanar locales, where they fight savage balor demons, titans, archdevils, lich archmages, and even avatars of the gods themselves. The dragons they encounter are wyrms of tremendous power, whose sleep troubles kingdoms and whose waking threatens existence itself.": "这些级别的冒险具有深远的影响，可能会决定物质世界甚至其他地方数百万人的命运。角色们穿越另一个世界的领域，探索半位面和其他星球外的地方，在那里他们与野蛮的巴罗尔恶魔、泰坦、大恶魔、巫师大法师，甚至是众神的化身战斗。他们遇到的龙是具有巨大力量的巫妖，它们的沉睡会给王国带来麻烦，它们的醒来会威胁到存在本身。",
	"Characters who reach 20th level have attained the pinnacle of mortal achievement. Their deeds are recorded in the annals of history and recounted by bards for centuries. Their ultimate destinies come to pass. A cleric might be taken up into the heavens to serve as a god's right hand. A warlock could become a patron to other warlocks. Perhaps a wizard unlocks the secret to immortality (or undeath) and spends eons exploring the farthest reaches of the multiverse. A druid might become one with the land, transforming into a nature spirit of a particular place or an aspect of the wild. Other characters could found clans or dynasties that revere the memory of their honored ancestors from generation to generation, create masterpieces of epic literature that are sung and retold for thousands of years, or establish guilds or orders that keep the adventurers' principles and dreams alive.": "达到20级的角色已经达到了凡人成就的顶峰。他们的事迹被记录在历史长河中，被吟游诗人传颂了几个世纪。他们最终的命运也会实现。牧师可能会被带入天堂，作为神的右手。一个术士可以成为其他术士的守护者。也许一个巫师解开了不朽（或不死）的秘密，并花了数年时间探索多元宇宙的最远端。德鲁伊可能会与土地融为一体，变成某个特定地方的自然之灵或野生的某个方面。其他角色可以建立宗族或王朝，一代又一代地尊崇他们尊贵的祖先的记忆，创造史诗文学的杰作，被传唱和复述数千年，或者建立公会或命令，使冒险者的原则和梦想得以延续。",
	"Reaching this point doesn't necessarily dictate the end of the campaign. These powerful characters might be called on to undertake grand adventures on the cosmic stage. And as a result of these adventures, their capabilities can continue to evolve.

Chapter 7 details epic boons you can use as rewards for these characters to maintain a sense of progress.": "达到这一点并不一定决定了活动的结束。这些强大的角色可能会被要求在宇宙舞台上进行盛大的冒险。而作为这些冒险的结果，他们的能力可以继续发展。角色在这时不会再获得更多的等级，但他们仍然可以以有意义的方式前进，并继续执行响彻整个多元宇宙的史诗般的事迹。第7章详细介绍了你可以用来作为这些角色的奖励的史诗恩赐，以保持一种进步感。",
	"Experienced players familiar with the capabilities of the character classes and impatient for more significant adventures might welcome the idea of starting a campaign with characters above 1st level.

Your choice can have a impact on the flavor of your campaign.": "龙与地下城是一种幻想游戏，但这个广泛的类别包含了很多种类。小说和电影中存在许多不同口味的幻想。你想要一个受H.P.洛夫克拉夫特或克拉克-阿什顿-史密斯作品启发的恐怖活动吗？或者你设想一个由肌肉发达的野蛮人和灵活的盗贼组成的世界，沿着罗伯特-E-霍华德和弗里茨-莱伯的经典剑与魔法书的路线？你的选择会对你的活动的味道产生影响。",
	"Heroic fantasy is the baseline assumed by the D&D rules. The Player's Handbook describes this baseline: a multitude of humanoid races coexist with humans in fantastic worlds. Adventurers bring magical powers to bear against the monstrous threats they face. These characters typically come from ordinary backgrounds, but something impels them into an adventuring life. The adventurers are the \"heroes\" of the campaign, but they might not be truly heroic, instead pursuing this life for selfish reasons. Technology and society are based on medieval norms, though the culture isn't necessarily European. Campaigns often revolve around delving into ancient dungeons in search of treasure or in an effort to destroy monsters or villains.": "英雄式幻想是D&D规则所假定的基线。玩家手册》描述了这一基线：众多的类人种族与人类在奇幻世界中共存。冒险者用神奇的力量来对抗他们所面临的可怕威胁。这些角色通常来自于普通的背景，但有些东西促使他们进入冒险生活。冒险者是活动中的 \"英雄\"，但他们可能不是真正的英雄，而是出于自私的原因追求这种生活。技术和社会是基于中世纪的规范，尽管文化不一定是欧洲的。活动往往围绕着深入古代地牢寻找宝藏或努力消灭怪物或恶棍而展开。",
	"This genre is also common in fantasy fiction. Most novels set in the Forgotten Realms are best described as heroic fantasy, following in the footsteps of many of the authors listed in appendix E of the Player's Handbook.": "这种体裁在奇幻小说中也很常见。大多数以被遗忘的领域为背景的小说最好被描述为英雄式的幻想，追随《玩家手册》附录E中所列的许多作者的脚步。",

Hardy adventurers venture into the unexplored jungle in search of the fabled City of Golden Masks.": "一个面目狰狞的大块头战士在自己的祭坛上将蛇神的大祭司开膛破肚。一个大笑的流氓在肮脏的酒馆里把不义之财花在廉价的酒上。艰苦的冒险家们冒险进入未开发的丛林，寻找传说中的金面具之城。",
	"A sword-and-sorcery campaign emulates some of the classic works of fantasy fiction, a tradition that goes back to the roots of the game. Here you'll find a dark, gritty world of evil sorcerers and decadent cities, where the protagonists are motivated more by greed and self-interest than by altruistic virtue. Fighter, rogue, and barbarian characters tend to be far more common than wizards, clerics, or paladins. In such a pulp fantasy setting, those who wield magic often symbolize the decadence and corruption of civilization, and wizards are the classic villains of these settings. Magic items are therefore rare and often dangerous.": "剑与魔法的战役模仿了一些奇幻小说的经典作品，这一传统可以追溯到游戏的根源。在这里，你会发现一个由邪恶的巫师和颓废的城市组成的黑暗、狡猾的世界，在这里，主角们更多的是受贪婪和自我利益的驱使，而不是利他主义的美德。斗士、流氓和野蛮人角色往往比巫师、牧师或圣骑士更常见。在这样的纸浆奇幻设定中，那些挥舞着魔法的人往往象征着文明的堕落和腐败，而魔法师是这些设定中的典型恶棍。因此，魔法物品很罕见，而且往往很危险。",
	"Certain Dungeons & Dragons novels follow in the footsteps of classic sword-and-sorcery novels. The world of Athas (as featured in numerous Dark Sun novels and game products), with its heroic gladiators and tyrannical sorcerer-kings, belongs squarely in this genre.": "某些《龙与地下城》小说追随了经典剑与魔法小说的脚步。阿塔斯世界（如众多黑暗太阳小说和游戏产品中的特色），其英雄的角斗士和暴虐的巫师国王，完全属于这一类型。",

	"An epic-fantasy campaign emphasizes the conflict between good and evil as a prominent element of the game, with the adventurers more or less squarely on the side of good. These characters are heroes in the best sense, driven by a higher purpose than selfish gain or ambition, and facing incredible dangers without blinking. Characters might struggle with moral quandaries, fighting the evil tendencies within themselves as well as the evil that threatens the world. And the stories of these campaigns often include an element of romance: tragic affairs between star-crossed lovers, passion that transcends even death, and chaste adoration between devout knights and the monarchs and nobles they serve.": "史诗般的奇幻活动强调善与恶之间的冲突是游戏的一个突出元素，而冒险者或多或少地站在善的一方。这些角色是最佳意义上的英雄，他们被比自私的利益或野心更高的目的所驱使，面对难以置信的危险不眨眼。角色可能会在道德困境中挣扎，与自己内心的邪恶倾向以及威胁世界的邪恶斗争。而这些战役的故事往往包括浪漫的元素：十字星恋人之间的悲剧，甚至超越死亡的激情，以及虔诚的骑士和他们所服务的君主和贵族之间的贞洁崇拜。",

	"A mythic-fantasy campaign draws on the themes and stories of ancient myth and legend, from Gilgamesh to Cu Chulainn. Adventurers attempt mighty feats of legend, aided or hindered by the gods or their agents—and they might have divine blood themselves. The monsters and villains they face probably have a similar origin. The minotaur in the dungeon isn't just another bull-headed humanoid, but {@i the} Minotaur-misbegotten offspring of a philandering god. Adventures might lead the heroes through a series of trials to the realms of the gods in search of a gift or favor.": "一个神话般的奇幻活动借鉴了古代神话和传说的主题和故事，从吉尔伽美什到库丘林。冒险家们在神灵或他们的代理人的帮助或阻碍下，试图完成传说中的伟大壮举，而他们自己可能也有神灵的血统。他们所面对的怪物和恶棍可能也有类似的起源。地牢里的牛头人并不是另一个牛头人，而是{@i the}牛头人--一个花心的神所生的后代。冒险可能会引导英雄们通过一系列的考验，到诸神的领域去寻找一种礼物或恩惠。",

	"If you want to put a horror spin on your campaign, you have plenty of material to work with. The Monster Manual is full of creatures that perfectly suit a storyline of supernatural horror. The most important element of such a campaign, though, isn't covered by the rules.

	"The swashbuckling adventures of pirates and musketeers suggest opportunities for a dynamic campaign. The characters typically spend more time in cities, royal courts, and seafaring vessels than in dungeon delves, making interaction skills important (though not to the extent of a pure intrigue campaign). Nevertheless, the heroes might end up in classic dungeon situations, such as searching storm sewers beneath the palace to find the evil duke's hidden chambers.": "海盗和火枪手的冒险故事为动态战役提供了机会。这些角色通常在城市、皇室法庭和航海船只上花费更多的时间，而不是在地牢探险中，这使得互动技能变得非常重要（尽管没有达到纯阴谋活动的程度）。然而，英雄们可能会在经典的地牢中结束，比如在宫殿下面的风暴下水道中寻找邪恶公爵的密室。",

The characters carry out specific missions: capture a magical standard that empowers undead armies, gather reinforcements to break a siege, or cut through the enemy's flank to reach a demonic commander. In other situations, the party supports the larger army by holding a strategic location until reinforcements arrive, killing enemy scouts before they can report, or cutting off supply lines. Information gathering and diplomatic missions can supplement the more combat-oriented adventures.": "幻想世界中的战争充满了冒险的机会。战争活动一般不关注部队运动的具体细节，而是关注那些扭转战局的英雄们。角色们执行特定的任务：夺取赋予亡灵军队力量的魔法标准，收集援军以打破围困，或者从敌人的侧翼切入以接触恶魔的指挥官。在其他情况下，该党派通过守住一个战略要地，直到援军到达，在敌人的侦察兵报告之前杀死他们，或切断供应线来支持大军。信息收集和外交任务可以补充更加注重战斗的冒险。",

	"A campaign that draws on elements of Asian martial-arts movies is a perfect match for D&D. Players can define the appearance of their characters and gear however they like for the campaign, and spells need only minor flavor changes so that they better reflect such a setting. For example, when the characters use spells or special abilities that teleport them short distances, they actually make high-flying acrobatic leaps. Ability checks to climb don't involve careful searching for holds but let characters bounce up walls or from tree to tree. Warriors stun their opponents by striking pressure points. Flavorful descriptions of actions in the game don't change the nuts and bolts of the rules, but they make all the difference in the feel of a campaign.": "一个借鉴了亚洲武侠电影元素的战役与D&D是完美匹配的。玩家可以在活动中随意定义他们的角色和装备的外观，而法术只需要做一些细微的味道改变，以便更好地反映这样的背景。例如，当角色使用法术或特殊能力将其短距离传送时，他们实际上是在进行高空杂技跳跃。攀爬的能力检查不需要小心翼翼地寻找支撑点，而是让角色在墙上或树与树之间弹跳。战士们通过打击压力点来击晕对手。对游戏中的行动进行有趣的描述并不改变规则的具体内容，但它们会使活动的感觉完全不同。",
	"Similarly, a class doesn't need new rules to reflect a cultural influence; a new name can do the trick. A traditional Chinese wuxia hero might be a paladin who has a sword called the Oath of Vengeance, while a Japanese samurai might be a paladin with a particular Oath of Devotion (bushido) that includes fealty to a lord (daimyo) among its tenets. A ninja is a monk who pursues the Way of Shadow. Whether called a wu jen, a tsukai, or a swami, a wizard, sorcerer, or warlock character works just fine in a game inspired by medieval Asian cultures.": "同样，一个等级不需要新的规则来反映文化的影响；一个新的名字就可以做到这一点。一个传统的中国武侠英雄可能是一个拥有一把名为 \"复仇之誓 \"的剑的圣骑士，而一个日本武士可能是一个拥有特殊的 \"奉献之誓\"（bushido）的圣骑士，其信条中包括对领主（大名）的忠诚。忍者是一个追求影子之道的僧侣。不管是叫武将，TSUKAI，还是Swami，一个魔法师，巫师，或术士角色在一个由中世纪亚洲文化激发的游戏中都是很好的。",

	"The renowned paladin Murlynd, from the world of Oerth (as featured in Greyhawk novels and game products), dresses in the traditional garb of Earth's Old West and wears a pair of six-shooters strapped to his waist. The Mace of St. Cuthbert, a holy weapon belonging to Greyhawk's god of justice, found its way to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in 1985. Somewhere in the Barrier Peaks of Oerth, the wreckage of a spacefaring vessel is said to lie, with bizarre alien lifeforms and strange items of technology on board. And the famous wizard Elminster of the Forgotten Realms has been said to make occasional appearances in the kitchen of Canadian writer Ed Greenwood—where he is sometimes joined by wizards from the worlds of Oerth and Krynn (homeworld of the Dragonlance saga).": "著名的圣骑士Murlynd来自Oerth世界（如格雷霍克小说和游戏产品中的特色），他穿着地球旧西部的传统服装，腰上绑着一对六连发手枪。圣库斯伯特之矛是属于灰鹰的正义之神的神圣武器，于1985年进入伦敦的维多利亚和阿尔伯特博物馆。在Oerth壁垒峰的某个地方，据说躺着一艘太空船的残骸，船上有奇怪的外星生命体和奇怪的技术物品。据说《被遗忘的领域》中著名的巫师艾尔明斯特偶尔会出现在加拿大作家艾德-格林伍德的厨房里--在那里他有时会和来自Oerth和Krynn世界（《龙之谷》传奇的故乡）的巫师们一起出现。",
	"Deep in D&D's roots are elements of science fiction and science fantasy, and your campaign might draw on those sources as well. It's okay to send your characters hurtling through a magic mirror to Lewis Carroll's Wonderland, put them aboard a ship traveling between the stars, or set your campaign in a far-future world where laser blasters and magic missiles exist side by side. The possibilities are limitless. Chapter 9, \"Dungeon Master's Workshop\" provides tools for exploring those possibilities.": "在D&D的根基中深藏着科幻小说和科学幻想的元素，而你的活动也可以借鉴这些来源。你可以让你的角色通过魔镜飞向刘易斯-卡罗尔的仙境，让他们登上一艘在星际间旅行的飞船，或者将你的活动设定在一个激光枪和魔法导弹并存的遥远未来世界。这种可能性是无限的。第9章，\"地下城主的工作室 \"提供了探索这些可能性的工具。",
	"When Adventurers reach higher levels their path extends to other dimensions of reality: the planes of existence that form the multiverse. The characters might be called on to rescue a friend from the horrific depths of the Abyss or to sail the shining waters of the River Oceanus. They can hoist a tankard with the friendly giants of Ysgard or face the chaos of Limbo to contact a wizened githzerai sage.": "当冒险者达到更高的级别时，他们的道路会延伸到现实的其他维度：构成多元宇宙的存在平面。角色们可能会被要求从深渊的恐怖深处拯救朋友，或者在海神河的闪亮水域中航行。他们可以与Ysgard的友好巨人一起举起酒杯，也可以面对Limbo的混乱，与一个聪明的githzerai圣人联系。",
	"Planes of existence define the extremes of strange and often dangerous environments. The most bizarre locations present settings undreamed of in the natural world. Planar adventures offer unprecedented dangers and wonders. Adventurers walk on streets made of solid fire, or test their mettle on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn.": "存在的平面定义了奇怪和往往危险的环境的极端。最诡异的地点呈现出自然界中做梦也想不到的环境。平面冒险提供了前所未有的危险和奇迹。冒险者走在由固体火焰组成的街道上，或在战场上测试他们的能力，在那里，每一个黎明都会有死去的人复活。",
	"The various planes of existence are realms of myth and mystery. They're not simply other worlds, but dimensions formed and governed by spiritual and elemental principles.": "各种存在的平面是神话和神秘的领域。它们不是简单的其他世界，而是由精神和元素原则形成和支配的维度。",
	"The Outer Planes are realms of spirituality and thought. They are the spheres where celestials, fiends, and deities exist. The plane of Elysium, for example, isn't merely a place where good creatures dwell, and not even simply the place where spirits of good creatures go when they die. It is the plane of goodness, a spiritual realm where evil can't flourish. It is as much a state of being and of mind as it is a physical location.": "外层世界是精神和思想的领域。它们是天人、魔人和神灵存在的领域。例如，极乐世界不仅仅是一个善良生物居住的地方，甚至不仅仅是善良生物的灵魂死后去的地方。它是善的层面，是邪恶无法滋生的精神境界。它既是一种存在和思想的状态，也是一个物理位置。",
	"The Inner Planes exemplify the physical essence and elemental nature of air, earth, fire, and water. The Elemental Plane of Fire, for example, embodies the essence of fire. The plane's entire substance is suffused with the fundamental nature of fire: energy, passion, transformation, and destruction. Even objects of solid brass or basalt seem to dance with flame, in a visible and palpable manifestation of the vibrancy of fire's dominion.": "内层平面体现了空气、地球、火和水的物理本质和元素性质。例如，火的元素界体现了火的本质。该平面的整个物质都充满了火的基本性质：能量、激情、转化和毁灭。即使是实心黄铜或玄武岩的物体也似乎在与火焰共舞，这是火的统治的活力的一种可见和可触及的表现。",
	"In this context, the Material Plane is the nexus where all these philosophical and elemental forces collide in the jumbled existence of mortal life and matter. The worlds of D&D exist within the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and adventures.": "在这种情况下，物质界是所有这些哲学和元素力量在凡人生命和物质的混乱存在中碰撞的纽带。D&D的世界存在于物质界中，使其成为大多数战役和冒险的起点。",
	"The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the Material Plane.": "多元宇宙的其余部分是相对于物质界而定义的。",

	"{@b The Material Plane and Its Echoes.} The Feywild and the Shadowfell are reflections of the Material Plane.": "{@b The Material Plane and Its Echoes.}精灵世界和阴影地带是物质世界的反射。",
	"{@b The Transitive Planes.} The Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are mostly featureless planes that serve primarily as pathways to travel from one plane to another.": "{@b The Transitive Planes.} 虚空界和星界大多是没有特征的平面，主要作为从一个平面到另一个平面的通道。",
	"{@b The Inner Planes.} The four Elemental Planes (Air, Earth, Fire, and Water), plus the Elemental Chaos that surrounds them, are the Inner Planes.": "{@b The Inner Planes.} 四个元素位面（空气、地球、火和水），加上环绕它们的元素混沌，就是内层位面。",
	"{@b The Outer Planes.} Sixteen Outer Planes correspond to the eight non-neutral alignments and shades of philosophical difference between them.": "{@b The Outer Planes.}十六个外层平面对应于八个非中立的排列和它们之间的哲学差异的深浅。",
	"{@b The Positive and Negative Planes.} These two planes enfold the rest of the cosmology, providing the raw forces of life and death that underlie the rest of existence in the multiverse.": "{@b The Positive and Negative Planes.}这两个平面包围着宇宙学的其他部分，提供了生命和死亡的原始力量，是多元宇宙中其他存在的基础。",
	"As described in the {@i Player's Handbook}, the assumed D&D cosmology includes more than two dozen planes. For your campaign, you decide what planes to include, inspired by the standard planes, drawn from Earth's myths, or created by your own imagination.": "如{@i Player's Handbook}所述，假定的D&D宇宙学包括二十多个平面。对于你的活动，你可以决定包括哪些平面，这些平面的灵感来自于标准平面，来自于地球的神话，或者由你自己的想象力创造。",
	"At minimum, most D&D campaigns require these elements:": "至少，大多数D&D活动都需要这些要素。",
	"A plane of origin for fiends": "恶魔的起源平面",
	"A plane of origin for celestials": "一个天体的起源平面",
	"A plane of origin for elementals": "元素的起源平面",
	"A place for deities, which might include any or all of the previous three": "一个供奉神灵的地方，可能包括前三者中的任何一个或全部",
	"The place where mortal spirits go after death, which might include any or all of the first three": "凡人死后灵魂的去处，可能包括前三者中的任何一个或全部。",
	"A way of getting from one plane to another": "从一个飞机到另一个飞机的方式",
	"A way for spells and monsters that use the Astral Plane and the Ethereal Plane to function": "让使用星界和虚空界的法术和怪物发挥作用的方法。",
	"Once you've decided on the planes you want to use in your campaign, putting them into a coherent cosmology is an optional step. Since the primary way of traveling from plane to plane, even using the Transitive Planes, is through magical portals that link planes together, the exact relationship of different planes to one another is largely a theoretical concern. No being in the multiverse can look down and see the planes in their arrangement the same way as we look at a diagram in a book. No mortal can verify whether Mount Celestia is sandwiched between Bytopia and Arcadia, but it's a convenient theoretical construct based on the philosophical shading among the three planes and the relative importance they give to law and good.": "一旦你决定了你想在战役中使用的平面，把它们放到一个连贯的宇宙学中是一个可选的步骤。由于从一个位面到另一个位面的主要旅行方式，即使是使用跨位面，也是通过神奇的传送门将各位面连接在一起，因此不同位面之间的确切关系在很大程度上是一个理论问题。多元宇宙中的任何生命都无法像我们看书中的图表一样，俯视并看到各平面的排列。没有凡人可以证实天山是否夹在拜托邦和阿卡迪亚之间，但这是一个方便的理论构造，它基于三个星球之间的哲学阴影以及它们对法律和善的相对重要性。",
	"Sages have constructed a few such theoretical models to make sense of the jumble of planes, particularly the Outer Planes. The three most common are the Great Wheel, the World Tree, and the World Axis, but you can create or adapt whatever model works best for the planes you want to use in your game.": "圣人已经构建了一些这样的理论模型，以使杂乱无章的星球，特别是外部星球有意义。最常见的三个模型是大轮盘、世界树和世界轴，但你可以为你想在游戏中使用的星球创建或改编任何最有效的模型。",
	"Each of the planes described in this chapter has at least one significant effect on travelers who venture there. When you design your own planes, it's a good idea to stick to that model. Create one simple trait that players notice, that doesn't create too much complication at the gaming table, and that's easy to remember. Try to reflect the philosophy and mood of the place, not merely its physical characteristics.": "本章所描述的每一架飞机都对在那里冒险的旅行者至少有一个重要影响。当你设计自己的飞机时，最好是坚持这个模式。创造一个简单的特征，让玩家注意到，在游戏桌上不会产生太多复杂的东西，而且容易记住。试着反映这个地方的哲学和情绪，而不仅仅是它的物理特征。",
	"The default cosmological arrangement presented in the Player's Handbook visualizes the planes as a group of concentric wheels, with the Material Plane and its echoes at the center. The Inner Planes form a wheel around the Material Plane, enveloped in the Ethereal Plane. Then the Outer Planes form another wheel around and behind (or above or below) that one, arranged according to alignment, with the Outlands linking them all.": "在《玩家手册》中，默认的宇宙学安排将各个星球想象成一组同心轮，物质界和它的回声位于中心。内层位面在物质位面周围形成一个轮子，被空灵位面所笼罩。然后，外层世界形成另一个轮子，围绕着这个轮子，并在其后面（或上面或下面），根据排列方式排列，由外域将它们全部连接起来。",
	"This arrangement makes sense of the way the River Styx flows among the Lower Planes, connecting Acheron, the Nine Hells, Gehenna, Hades, Carceri, the Abyss, and Pandemonium like beads on a string. But it's not the only possible explanation of the river's course.": "这种安排使冥河在下层世界中的流动方式变得合理，它像绳子上的珠子一样连接着阿克伦、九层地狱、地府、哈迪斯、卡塞里、深渊和潘德文。但这并不是对河道的唯一可能解释。",
	"A different arrangement of planes envisions them situated among the roots and branches of a great cosmic tree, literally or figuratively.": "一个不同的平面安排设想他们位于一棵伟大的宇宙之树的根和枝之间，从字面上或比喻上来说。",
	"For example, the Norse cosmology centers on the World Tree Yggdrasil. The three roots of the World Tree touch the three realms: Asgard (an Outer Plane that includes Valhalla, Vanaheim, Alfheim, and other regions), Midgard (the Material Plane), and Niflheim (the underworld). The Bifrost, the rainbow bridge, is a unique transitive plane that connects Asgard and Midgard.": "例如，北欧的宇宙学以世界树Yggdrasil为中心。世界树的三根触及三个境界。阿斯加德（包括瓦尔哈拉、瓦纳海姆、阿尔夫海姆和其他地区的外部世界）、米德加德（物质世界）和尼弗尔海姆（阴间）。Bifrost，即彩虹桥，是连接阿斯加德和米德加德的独特过渡平面。",
	"Similarly, one vision of the planes where the deities of the Forgotten Realms reside situates a number of celestial planes in the branches of a World Tree, while the fiendish planes are linked by a River of Blood. Neutral planes stand apart from them. Each of these planes is primarily the domain of one or more deities, though they are also the homes of celestial and fiendish creatures.": "同样地，关于被遗忘领域的神灵所居住的位面的一个设想是，一些天体位面位于世界树的树枝上，而恶魔位面则由一条血河连接。中立位面与它们分开。这些平面主要是一个或多个神灵的领域，尽管它们也是天人和恶魔生物的家园。",
	"In this view of the cosmos, the Material Plane and its echoes stand between two opposing realms. The Astral Plane (or Astral Sea) floats above them, holding any number of divine domains (the Outer Planes). Below the Material Plane is the Elemental Chaos, a single, undifferentiated elemental plane where all the elements clash together. At the bottom of the Elemental Chaos is the Abyss, like a hole torn in the fabric of the cosmos.": "在这种宇宙观中，物质界和它的回声站在两个对立的境界之间。星界（或星海）漂浮在它们之上，拥有任何数量的神域（外星界）。物质界下面是元素混沌，这是一个单一的、无差别的元素界，所有的元素都在这里发生冲突。元素混沌的底部是深渊，就像宇宙结构中被撕裂的一个洞。",
	"As you build your own cosmology, consider the following alternatives.": "当你建立自己的宇宙观时，请考虑以下替代方案。",
	"This simple cosmology covers the bare minimum: a Material Plane; the Transitive Planes; a single Elemental Chaos; an Overheaven, where good-aligned deities and celestials live; and the Underworld, where evil deities and fiends live.": "这个简单的宇宙论涵盖了最基本的内容：一个物质界；过渡界；一个单一的元素混沌；一个上天，善的神灵和天人居住的地方；以及冥界，邪恶的神灵和魔鬼居住的地方。",
	"In this cosmology, countless planes clump together like soap bubbles, intersecting with each other more or less at random.": "在这个宇宙论中，无数的平面像肥皂泡一样聚集在一起，或多或少随机地相互交错。",
	"All the Inner and Outer Planes orbit the Material Plane, exerting greater or lesser influence on the world as they come nearer and farther. The world of Eberron uses this cosmological model.": "所有的内部和外部星球都围绕着物质界运行，随着它们的靠近和远离，对世界产生或多或少的影响。Eberron世界采用了这种宇宙学模型。",
	"In this cosmology, every plane is a stop along an infinite road. Each plane is adjacent to two others, but there's no necessary cohesion between adjacent planes; a traveler can walk from the slopes of Mount Celestia onto the slopes of Gehenna.": "在这个宇宙论中，每一个平面都是无限道路上的一个站点。每个平面都与其他两个平面相邻，但相邻平面之间没有必要的内聚力；一个旅行者可以从天山的山坡走到地府的山坡。",
	"In the Greek cosmology, Mount Olympus stands at the center of the world (the Material Plane), with its peak so high that it's actually another plane of existence: Olympus, the home of the gods. All the Greek gods except Hades have their own domains within Olympus. In Hades, named for its ruler, mortal souls linger as insubstantial shades until they eventually fade into nothing. Tartarus, where the titans are imprisoned in endless darkness, lies below Hades. And far to the west of the known world in the Material Plane are the blessed Elysian Fields. The souls of great heroes reside there.": "在希腊的宇宙观中，奥林匹斯山矗立在世界的中心（物质界），其山峰非常高，实际上是另一个存在的平面。奥林匹斯，众神的家园。除哈迪斯外，所有希腊诸神都在奥林匹斯山内有自己的领地。在以其统治者命名的哈迪斯，凡人的灵魂作为无实体的影子徘徊，直到最终消逝于无形。塔尔塔罗斯（Tartarus）位于哈迪斯的下方，那里是泰坦巨人被囚禁在无尽的黑暗中。而在物质世界已知世界的西边，是受祝福的极乐世界。伟大英雄的灵魂居住在那里。",
	"The Egyptian cosmology is defined by the daily path of the sun-across the sky of the Material Plane, down to the fair Offering Fields in the west, where the souls of the righteous live in eternal reward, and then beneath the world through the nightmarish Twelve Hours of Night. The Solar Barge is a tiny Outer Plane in its own right, though it exists within the Astral Plane and the other Outer Planes in the different stages of its journey.": "埃及的宇宙观是由太阳的日常轨迹定义的--穿过物质界的天空，下到西方公平的供奉场，在那里正义者的灵魂生活在永恒的奖赏中，然后在世界的下方通过噩梦般的十二小时的夜晚。太阳驳船本身就是一个很小的外部世界，尽管它在其旅程的不同阶段存在于星界和其他外部世界中。",
	"In this model, there are no other planes of existence, but the Material Plane includes places like the bottomless Abyss, the shining Mount Celestia, the strange city of Mechanus, the fortress of Acheron, and so on. All the planes are locations in the world, reachable by ordinary means of travel-though extraordinary effort is required, for example, to sail across the sea to the blessed isles of Elysium.": "在这个模型中，没有其他存在的平面，但物质平面包括像无底的深渊、闪亮的天山、奇怪的麦加努斯城、阿克伦堡垒等地方。所有的位面都是世界上的地点，可以通过普通的旅行方式到达--尽管需要付出非凡的努力，例如，渡海前往极乐世界的祝福岛屿。",
	"In this model, the Material Plane has a twin realm that fills the role of all the other planes. Much like the Feywild, it overlays the Material Plane and can be reached through thin places where the worlds are particularly close: through caves, by sailing far across the sea, or in fairy rings in remote forests. It has dark, evil regions (homes of fiends and evil gods), sacred isles (homes of celestials and the spirits of the blessed death), and realms of elemental fury. This otherworld is sometimes overseen by an eternal city, or by four cities that each represent a different aspect of reality. The Celtic cosmology has an otherworld, called Tir na nug, and the cosmologies of some religions inspired by Asian myth have a similar Spirit World.": "在这个模型中，物质界有一个孪生界，填补了所有其他界的作用。和精灵世界一样，它覆盖在物质界之上，可以通过世界特别接近的稀薄地方到达：通过洞穴，通过远航渡海，或者在偏远森林的仙女环中。它有黑暗、邪恶的区域（恶魔和邪神的家园），神圣的岛屿（天人和受祝福的死亡之灵的家园），以及元素狂暴的境界。这个异世界有时由一个永恒的城市监管，或由四个城市监管，每个城市都代表现实的不同方面。凯尔特人的宇宙观有一个另一个世界，叫做Tir na nug，一些受亚洲神话启发的宗教的宇宙观也有一个类似的精神世界。",
	"When adventurers travel to other planes of existence, they undertake a legendary journey that might force them to face supernatural guardians and undergo various ordeals. The nature of that journey and the trials along the way depend in part on the means of travel, and whether the adventurers find a magic portal or use a spell to carry them.": "当冒险者前往其他存在的星球时，他们会进行一次传奇之旅，可能会迫使他们面对超自然的守护者并经历各种磨难。这段旅程的性质和沿途的考验部分取决于旅行的方式，以及冒险者是否找到了魔法门或使用法术来运送他们。",
	"[Raistlin's] eyes studied the Portal, studied every detail intently-although it was not really necessary. He had seen it myriad times in dreams both sleeping and waking. The spells to open it were simple, nothing elaborate or complex.": "[雷斯林的眼睛研究着传送门，仔细地研究每一个细节--尽管这并不是真的需要。他在睡觉和醒来的梦中都见过它无数次。打开它的法术很简单，没有什么复杂的东西。",
	"Each of the five dragon heads surrounding and guarding the Portal must be propitiated with the correct phrase. Each must be spoken to in the proper order. But, once that was done and the White Robed Cleric had exhorted Paladine to intercede and hold the Portal open, they would enter. It would close behind them.": "围绕和守卫门户的五个龙首都必须用正确的话语来祭祀。必须按照适当的顺序对每个人说话。但是，一旦完成了这些，而且白袍教士劝说帕拉丁进行调解并保持门户开放，他们就会进入。它将在他们身后关闭。",
	"And he would face his greatest challenge.": "他将面临他最大的挑战。",
	"\"Portal\" is a general term for a stationary interplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane to a specific location on another. Some portals function like doorways, appearing as a clear window or a fog-shrouded passage, and interplanar travel is as simple as stepping through the doorway. Other portals are locations-circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing ships, or even whole towns-that exist in multiple planes at once or flicker from one plane to another. Some are vortices, joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar location on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano (leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the Plane of Water).": "\"传送门 \"是一个固定的星际连接的总称，它将一个平面上的特定位置与另一个平面上的特定位置连接起来。有些传送门的功能就像门洞一样，出现在一个清晰的窗口或一个被雾气笼罩的通道上，星际旅行就像跨过门洞一样简单。其他的传送门是一些地点--一圈站立的石头、高耸的塔楼、帆船，甚至是整个城镇--它们同时存在于多个平面，或者从一个平面闪烁到另一个。有些是漩涡，将一个元素位面与物质位面的一个非常相似的位置连接起来，比如火山的中心（通往火位面）或海洋深处（通往水位面）。",
	"Passing through a planar portal can be the simplest way to travel from the Material Plane to a desired location on another plane. Most of the time, though, a portal presents an adventure in itself.": "穿过一个平面传送门，可以说是从物质界到另一个平面的理想地点的最简单方法。不过，大多数时候，传送门本身就是一种冒险。",
	"First, the adventurers must find a portal that leads where they want to go. Most portals exist in distant locations, and a portal's location often has thematic similarities to the plane it leads to. For example, a portal to the heavenly mountain of Celestia might be located on a mountain peak.": "首先，冒险者们必须找到一个能通往他们想去的地方的传送门。大多数传送门都存在于遥远的地方，一个传送门的位置往往与它所通往的平面有主题上的相似性。例如，通往天国的天山的传送门可能位于一座山峰上。",
	"Second, portals often have guardians charged with ensuring that undesirable people don't pass through. Depending on the portal's destination, \"undesirable people\" might include evil characters, good characters, cowards, thieves, anyone wearing a robe, or any mortal creature. A portal's guardian is typically a powerful magical creature, such as a genie, sphinx, titan, or native of the portal's destination plane.": "第二，传送门通常有守护者，负责确保不受欢迎的人不会通过。根据传送门的目的地，\"不受欢迎的人 \"可能包括邪恶人物、善良人物、懦夫、小偷、任何穿着长袍的人，或任何凡人生物。传送门的守护者通常是一个强大的魔法生物，如精灵、斯芬克斯、泰坦或传送门目的地位面的本地人。",
	"Finally, most portals don't stand open all the time, but open only in particular situations or when a certain requirement is met. A portal can have any conceivable requirement, but the following are the most common:": "最后，大多数门户不是一直开放的，而是只在特定情况下或满足某种要求时才开放。一个门户网站可以有任何可以想象的要求，但以下是最常见的。",
	"The portal functions only at particular times: during a full moon on the Material Plane, or every ten days, or when the stars are in a particular position. Once it opens, such a portal remains open for a limited time, such as for three days following the full moon, or for an hour, or for {@dice 1d4 + 1} rounds.": "这个传送门只在特定的时间发挥作用：在物质界的满月期间，或每十天一次，或当星星处于特定位置时。一旦打开，这样的传送门就会在有限的时间内保持开放，比如满月后的三天，或一小时，或{@dice 1d4 + 1}轮。",
	"The portal functions only if a particular condition is met. A situation-keyed portal opens on a clear night, or when it rains, or when a certain spell is cast in its vicinity.": "传送门只有在满足某个特定条件时才会发挥作用。一个有条件的传送门会在晴朗的夜晚打开，或在下雨时打开，或在其附近被施以某种咒语时打开。",
	"A random portal functions for a random period, then shuts down for a similarly random duration. Typically, such a portal allows {@dice 1d6 + 6} travelers to pass through, then shuts down for {@dice 1d6} days.": "一个随机的传送门在一个随机的时期内运作，然后在一个类似的随机时间内关闭。通常情况下，这样的入口允许{@dice 1d6 + 6}的旅客通过，然后关闭{@dice 1d6}天。",
	"The portal functions only if a particular command word is spoken. Sometimes the word must be spoken as a character passes through the portal (which is otherwise a mundane doorway, window, or similar opening). Other portals open when the command word is spoken and remain open for a short time.": "只有在说出一个特定的命令词时，传送门才会发挥作用。有时必须在角色通过传送门（否则就是一个普通的门口、窗户或类似的开口）时说出这个词。其他的传送门在命令词被说出来时就会打开，并在短时间内保持开放。",
	"The portal functions if the traveler is holding a particular object; the item acts much like a key to a door. This key item can be a common object or a particular key created for that portal. The city of Sigil above the Outlands is known as the City of Doors because it features an overwhelming number of such item-keyed portals.": "如果旅行者持有一个特定的物品，门户就会发挥作用；该物品的作用很像一扇门的钥匙。这把钥匙可以是一个普通的物品，也可以是为该门户创造的特殊钥匙。外域之上的西格尔城被称为门之城，因为它有大量这样的物品钥匙的传送门。",
	"Learning and meeting a portal's requirements can draw characters into further adventures as they chase down a key item, scour old libraries for command words, or consult sages to find the right time to visit the portal.": "学习和满足一个门户的要求可以吸引角色进入进一步的冒险，因为他们要追寻一个关键的物品，在古老的图书馆中寻找命令词，或者咨询圣人以寻找访问门户的正确时间。",
	"Sarya raised her hands and began to declaim the words of a very powerful spell, one of the most dangerous she knew, a spell designed to breach the barriers between the planes and create a magical bridge into another realm of existence. The mythal thrummed in response, the intangible pulse of the old device taking on a new and different note. Sarya ignored the mythal stone's change and pressed on, finishing her gate spell with skill and confidence.": "萨利娅举起双手，开始宣读一个非常强大的咒语，这是她所知道的最危险的咒语之一，这个咒语的目的是要突破平面之间的障碍，创造一个进入另一个存在领域的魔法桥梁。咒语颤动着回应，这个古老装置的无形脉冲呈现出一种新的和不同的音符。萨利娅没有理会神话石的变化，继续前进，以熟练和自信的方式完成了她的大门咒语。",
	"\"The gate is open!\" she cried. \"Malkizid, come forth!\"": "\"门开了！\"她喊道。\"马尔基兹德，出来吧！\"",
	"Before Sarya a great ring or hoop of golden magic coalesced from the air. Through it she glimpsed the realm of Malkizid, an infernal wasteland of parched desert, windswept rifts, and black, angry skies torn by crimson lightning. Then, through the gate, the archdevil Malkizid appeared. With one smooth step he crossed from his infernal plane into the mythal chamber.": "在萨利娅面前，一个巨大的金色魔法环或圈从空中凝聚起来。通过它，她瞥见了Malkizid的领域，一个由枯萎的沙漠、风吹的裂缝和被深红色闪电撕裂的黑色、愤怒的天空组成的地狱荒原。然后，通过大门，大恶魔马尔基兹德出现了。随着一个平稳的步骤，他从他的地狱平面进入了神话室。",
	"A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other planes of existence. {@i Plane shift} and {@i gate} can directly transport adventurers to any other plane, with different degrees of precision. Etherealness allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane. And the {@i astral projection} spell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and from there travel to the Outer Planes.": "一些法术允许直接或间接进入其他存在的位面。{@i Plane shift}和{@i gate}可以直接将冒险者传送到任何其他位面，并有不同程度的精确度。虚空之力（Etherealness）允许冒险者进入虚空界。而{@i astral projection}的法术可以让冒险者将自己投射到星界，并从那里前往外星界。",
	"The plane shift spell has two important limitations. The first is the material component: a small, forked, metal rod (like a tuning fork) attuned to the desired planar destination. The spell requires the proper resonating frequency to home in on the correct location, and the fork must be made of the right material (sometimes a complex alloy) to focus the spell's magic properly. Crafting the fork is expensive (at least 250 gp), but even the act of researching the correct specifications can lead to adventure. After all, not many people voluntarily travel into the depths of Carceri, so very few know what kind of tuning fork is required to get there.": "平面转移咒语有两个重要的限制。首先是材料部分：一根分叉的小金属棒（像音叉一样）被调整到所需的平面目的地。咒语需要适当的共鸣频率来锁定正确的位置，而且叉子必须由适当的材料（有时是复杂的合金）制成，以正确集中咒语的魔力。制作叉子很贵（至少250金币），但即使是研究正确规格的行为也会导致冒险。毕竟，没有多少人自愿进入卡塞里的深处，所以很少有人知道需要什么样的音叉才能到达那里。",
	"Second, the spell doesn't send the caster to a specific location unless he or she has specialized information. The sigil sequence of a teleportation circle located on another plane allows the caster to travel directly to that circle, but such knowledge is even harder to come by than the specifications of the required tuning fork. Otherwise, the spell transports the caster to a location in the general vicinity of the desired spot. Wherever the adventurers arrive, they'll most likely still need to undertake a journey to reach the object of a planar quest.": "第二，除非施法者有专门的信息，否则这个咒语不会把施法者送到一个特定的地点。位于另一平面的传送圈的符号序列允许施法者直接前往该传送圈，但这种知识比所需音叉的规格更难得到。否则，该咒语会将施法者传送到所需地点附近的一个地方。无论冒险者到达哪里，他们很可能仍然需要进行一次旅行来到达平面探索的目标。",
	"The gate spell opens a portal linked to a specific point on another plane of existence. The spell provides a shortcut to a planar destination, bypassing many of the guardians and trials that would normally fill such a journey. But this 9th-level spell is out of reach for all but the most powerful characters, and it does nothing to negate any obstacles that wait at the destination.": "闸门咒语打开了一个与另一个存在平面上的特定点相连的门户。这个法术提供了一条通往一个平面目的地的捷径，绕过了许多通常会充满这种旅程的守护者和考验。但这个9级法术除了最强大的角色外，其他的人都无法企及，而且它对否定在目的地等待的任何障碍毫无作用。",
	"The {@spell gate} spell is powerful, but not infallible. A deity, demon lord, or other powerful entity can prevent such a portal from opening within its dominion.": "{@spell gate}的咒语很强大，但不是无懈可击的。神灵、恶魔领主或其他强大的实体可以阻止这样的入口在其统治范围内打开。",
	"Halisstra opened her eyes and found herself drifting in an endless silver sea. Soft gray clouds moved slowly in the distance, while strange dark streaks twisted violently through the sky, anchored in ends so distant she couldn't perceive them, their middle parts revolving angrily like pieces of string rolled between a child's fingertips. She glanced down, wondering what supported her, and saw nothing but more of the strange pearly sky beneath her feet and all around her.": "哈里斯特拉睁开眼睛，发现自己在一片无尽的银海中漂流。柔和的灰色云朵在远处缓缓移动，而奇怪的黑暗条纹在天空中猛烈地扭动着，固定在她无法感知的遥远的尽头，它们的中间部分愤怒地旋转着，就像在孩子的指尖间滚动的线段。她往下看，想知道是什么支撑着她，除了她脚下和周围更多奇怪的珍珠色天空，她什么也没看到。",
	"She drew in a sudden breath, surprised by the sight, and felt her lungs fill with something sweeter and perhaps a little more solid than air, but instead of gagging or drowning on the stuff she seemed perfectly acclimated to it. An electric thrill raced through her limbs as she found herself mesmerized by the simple act of respiration.": "她突然吸了一口气，对这一景象感到惊讶，并感到她的肺里充满了比空气更甜的东西，也许还有点固体，但她没有被这东西堵住嘴或淹死，而是似乎完全适应了它。当她发现自己被简单的呼吸行为迷住时，一种电流般的快感在她的四肢百骸中奔腾。",
	"The Astral Plane is the realm of thought and dream, where visitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the Outer Planes. It is a great silvery sea, the same above and below, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes of light like distant stars. Most of the Astral Sea is a vast, empty expanse. Visitors occasionally stumble upon the petrified corpse of a dead god or other chunks of rock drifting forever in the silvery void. Much more commonplace are color pools—magical pools of colored light that flicker like radiant, spinning coins.": "星界是思想和梦境的领域，游客在这里作为无实体的灵魂旅行，以到达外星界。它是一个巨大的银色海洋，上下都一样，有白色和灰色的漩涡，在光的微尘中划过，像遥远的星星。星海的大部分地区是一片广阔无垠的空地。游客们偶尔会偶然发现一具死去的神的石化尸体或其他大块的岩石在银色的虚空中永远漂流。更常见的是彩池--神奇的彩光池，像光芒四射、旋转的硬币一样闪烁着。",
	"Creatures on the Astral Plane don't age or suffer from hunger or thirst. For this reason, humanoids that live on the Astral Plane (such as the githyanki) establish outposts on other planes, often the Material Plane, so their children can grow to maturity.": "星界的生物不会衰老，也不会遭受饥饿或干渴。出于这个原因，生活在星界的人类（如吉特安基）在其他星球上建立了前哨站，通常是物质世界，这样他们的孩子就可以成长为成熟的人。",
	"A traveler in the Astral Plane can move by simply thinking about moving, but distance has little meaning. In combat, though, a creature's walking speed (in feet) is equal to 3 × its Intelligence score. The smarter a creature is, the easier it can control its movement by act of will.": "在星界的旅行者可以通过简单的思考移动，但距离没有什么意义。不过在战斗中，一个生物的行走速度（以英尺为单位）等于3×它的智力得分。一个生物越聪明，它就越容易通过意志行为控制自己的移动。",
	"Traveling through the Astral Plane by means of the {@spell astral projection} spell involves projecting one's consciousness there, usually in search of a gateway to an Outer Plane to visit. Since the Outer Planes are as much spiritual states of being as they are physical places, this allows a character to manifest in an Outer Plane as if he or she had physically traveled there, but as in a dream.": "通过{@spell astral projection}法术在星界旅行涉及到将自己的意识投射到那里，通常是为了寻找一个通往外星界的通道来访问。由于外星界既是精神存在的状态，也是物理存在的地方，这允许一个角色在外星界显现，就像他或她在那里实际旅行过一样，但只是在梦中。",
	"A character's death-either in the Astral Plane or on the destination plane-causes no actual harm. Only the severing of a character's silver cord while on the Astral Plane (or the death of his or her helpless physical body on the Material Plane) can result in the character's true death. Thus, high-level characters sometimes travel to the Outer Planes by way of astral projection rather than seek out a portal or use a more direct spell.": "一个角色的死亡--无论是在星界还是在目的界--都不会造成实际伤害。只有在星界时切断角色的银线（或在物质界上他或她无助的肉体死亡）才会导致角色的真正死亡。因此，高水平的人物有时会通过星界投影的方式前往外部世界，而不是寻找传送门或使用更直接的咒语。",
	"Only a few things can sever a traveler's silver cord, the most common being a psychic wind (described below). The legendary silver swords of the githyanki also have this ability. A character who travels bodily to the Astral Plane (by means of the plane shift spell or one of the rare portals that leads directly there) has no silver cord.": "只有少数东西可以切断旅行者的银线，最常见的是通灵之风（如下所述）。Githyanki的传奇银剑也有这种能力。一个人物如果身体旅行到星界（通过平面转换法术或直接通往那里的罕见门户之一），就没有银线。",

	"Tales speak of children kidnapped by fey creatures and spirited away to the Feywild, only to return to their parents years later without having aged a day, and with no memories of their captors or the realm they came from. Likewise, adventurers who return from an excursion to the Feywild are often alarmed to discover upon their return that time flows differently on the Plane of Faerie, and that the memories of their visit are hazy. You can use these optional rules to reflect the strange magic that suffuses the plane.": "传说中，孩子们被精灵生物绑架并被带到了精灵世界，多年后才回到父母身边，却一天也没变老，也没有关于绑架者和他们所处领域的记忆。同样地，从仙境游历归来的冒险者们常常惊恐地发现，时间在仙境的流动是不同的，而且他们对这次访问的记忆也是模糊的。你可以使用这些可选的规则来反映弥漫在这个平面上的奇怪魔法。",
	"A creature that leaves the Feywild must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. Fey creatures automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do any creatures, like elves, that have the Fey Ancestry trait. A creature that fails the saving throw remembers nothing from its time spent in the Feywild. On a successful save, the creature's memories remain intact but are a little hazy. Any spell that can end a curse can restore the creature's lost memories.": "离开仙境的生物必须做一个DC10的智慧救赎。翡冷翠的生物会自动成功，任何具有翡冷翠血统特征的生物，如精灵，也是如此。救赎失败的生物不会记得它在Feywild度过的时间。如果救赎成功，该生物的记忆将保持完整，但有些模糊不清。任何可以结束诅咒的法术都可以恢复该生物失去的记忆。",
	"While time seems to pass normally in the Feywild, characters might spend a day there and realize, upon leaving the plane, that less or more time has elapsed everywhere else in the multiverse.": "虽然时间在翡冷翠似乎是正常流逝的，但人物可能在那里呆了一天，在离开飞机时发现多元宇宙的其他地方经过的时间或少或多。",
	"Whenever a creature or group of creatures leaves the Feywild after spending at least 1 day on that plane, you can choose a time change that works best for your campaign, if any, or roll on the Feywild Time Warp table. A {@spell wish} spell can be used to remove the effect on up to ten creatures. Some powerful fey have the ability to grant such wishes and might do so if the beneficiaries agree to subject themselves to a {@spell geas} spell and complete a quest after the {@spell wish} spell is cast.": "每当一个生物或一群生物在该平面上呆了至少1天后离开仙界，你可以选择一个最适合你的活动的时间变化，如果有的话，或者在仙界时间扭曲表上滚动。一个（%0%）的法术可以用来消除对最多十个生物的影响。一些强大的费伊人有能力实现这样的愿望，如果受益人同意接受{@spell geas}法术并在{@spell wish}法术施放后完成任务，他们可能会这样做。",

	"Riven stood in the uppermost room of the central tower of his citadel-a fortress of shadows and dark stone carved in relief into the sheer face of a jagged peak.... The starless black vault of the plane's sky hung over a landscape of gray and black, where lived the dark simulacra of actual things. Shadows and wraiths and specters and ghosts and other undead hung in the air around the citadel, or prowled the foothills and plains near it, so numerous their glowing eyes looked like swarms of fireflies. He felt the darkness in everything he could see, felt it as an extension of himself, and the feeling made him too big by half.": "瑞文站在他的堡垒中央塔楼的最上层房间里--一座由阴影和黑石组成的堡垒，被浮雕在锯齿状的山峰上....。飞机的无星黑穹笼罩着灰色和黑色的景观，那里生活着实际事物的黑暗模拟。阴影、幽灵、鬼魂和其他亡灵在城堡周围的空气中徘徊，或者在城堡附近的山麓和平原上游荡，它们的发光眼睛看起来就像成群的萤火虫。他感觉到他所看到的一切的黑暗，感觉到它是自己的延伸，而这种感觉使他变得太过庞大。",
	"The Shadowfell, also called the Plane of Shadow, is a dimension of black, gray, and white where most other color has been leached from everything. It is a place of darkness that hates the light, where the sky is a black vault with neither sun nor stars. The Shadowfell overlaps the Material Plane in much the same way as the Feywild. Aside from the colorless landscape, it appears similar to the Material Plane.": "阴影地带，也被称为 \"阴影地带\"，是一个由黑色、灰色和白色组成的维度，在这里，其他大部分颜色都已经从一切事物中被剥离。这是一个憎恨光明的黑暗之地，那里的天空是一个既没有太阳也没有星星的黑色穹顶。阴影地带与物质界的重叠方式与精灵世界的重叠方式基本相同。除了无色的地貌，它看起来与物质界相似。",
	"Landmarks from the Material Plane are recognizable on the Shadowfell, but they are twisted and warped—distorted reflections of what exists on the Material Plane. Where a mountain stands on the Material Plane, the corresponding feature on the Shadowfell is a jagged rock outcropping with a resemblance to a skull, a heap of rubble, or perhaps the crumbling ruin of a once-great castle. A forest on the Shadowfell is dark and twisted, its branches reaching out to snare travelers' cloaks, and its roots coiling and buckling to trip those who pass by.": "物质世界的地标在暗影星域是可以识别的，但它们是物质世界存在的扭曲和变形的反映。在物质世界中，一座山峰矗立在那里，影子地平线上的相应特征是一个参差不齐的岩石露头，类似于一个头骨，一堆瓦砾，或者可能是一个曾经伟大的城堡的摇摇欲坠的遗址。阴影城的森林是黑暗和扭曲的，它的树枝伸向旅行者的斗篷，它的树根盘绕和弯曲，绊倒那些经过的人。",

	"Similar to fey crossings, shadow crossings are locations where the veil between the Material Plane and the Shadowfell is so thin that creatures can walk from one plane to the other. A blot of shadow in the corner of a dusty crypt might be a shadow crossing, as might an open grave. Shadow crossings form in gloomy places where spirits or the stench of death lingers, such as battlefields, graveyards, and tombs. They manifest only in darkness, closing as soon as they feel light's kiss.": "与 \"飞越 \"相似，\"影子穿越 \"是指物质世界和影子世界之间的面纱非常薄，生物可以从一个世界走到另一个世界的地方。尘土飞扬的墓室角落里的一抹阴影可能是一个阴影交叉点，就像一个开放的坟墓一样。影子交叉点在阴暗的地方形成，那里有灵魂或死亡的臭味萦绕，比如战场、墓地和坟墓。它们只在黑暗中显现，一旦感受到光的亲吻就会关闭。",
	"In remote corners of the Shadowfell, it is easy to reach horrific demiplanes ruled over by accursed beings of terrible evil. The best known of these is the valley of Barovia, overlooked by the towering spires of Castle Ravenloft and ruled by Count Strahd von Zarovich, the first vampire. Beings of the Shadowfell called the Dark Powers created these domains as prisons these \"darklords,\" and through cruelty or carelessness trapped innocent mortals in these domains as well.": "在Shadowfell的偏远角落，很容易到达由可怕的邪恶的诅咒生物所统治的恐怖半平面。其中最著名的是巴罗维亚山谷，它被雷文洛夫特城堡高耸的塔尖所俯瞰，由第一个吸血鬼斯特拉赫-冯-扎罗维奇伯爵统治。被称为 \"黑暗势力 \"的阴影地带的生物创造了这些领域，作为 \"黑暗领主 \"的监狱，并通过残忍或粗心将无辜的凡人也困在这些领域。",

	"If a character is already suffering a despair effect and fails the saving throw, the new despair effect replaces the old one. After finishing a long rest, a character can attempt to overcome the despair with a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. (The DC is higher because it's harder to shake off despair once it has taken hold.) On a successful save, the despair effect ends for that character.": "如果一个角色已经受到了绝望的影响，并且拯救动作失败，那么新的绝望效果就会取代旧的效果。在完成长时间的休息后，一个角色可以尝试用DC15智慧救赎来克服绝望。(DC比较高，因为一旦绝望占据上风，就很难摆脱它。) 拯救成功后，该角色的绝望效果结束。",

	"The city of Neverwinter in the world of the Forgotten Realms has a dark reflection on the Shadowfell: the city of Evernight. Evernight is a city of cracked stone edifices and homes of rotten wood. Its roads are made mostly of trampled grave dust, and its few cobbled streets are missing enough stones that they appear pockmarked. The sky is corpse gray, and the breeze blows cold and humid, bringing a chill to the skin.": "在《被遗忘的王国》世界中的永夜城对影子城有一个黑暗的反映：永夜城。永夜城是一座由破裂的石头建筑和腐烂的木头房屋组成的城市。它的道路大部分是由被踩踏的墓穴尘土构成的，少数鹅卵石铺成的街道缺少足够的石头，以至于看起来有麻点。天空是尸灰色的，微风吹来，寒冷而潮湿，给皮肤带来寒意。",

Here and there within the {@b Swamp of Oblivion} (also called the Plane of Ooze), stagnant lakes and pools play host to thickets of weeds and monstrous swarms of mosquitoes. The few settlements here consist of wooden structures suspended above the muck. Most are built on platforms between trees, but a few stand on stilts driven deep into the muck. No solid earth underlies the mud of the swamp, so houses built on poles eventually sink down into it.": "水界和土界之间的边界地区是一片可怕的沼泽地，在那里，扭曲的参天大树和茂密的刺鼻藤蔓从浓密的淤泥和粘液中生长出来。在{@b Swamp of Oblivion}(也被称为渗水平面)内的各个地方，停滞的湖泊和池塘里长满了杂草丛和可怕的蚊子群。这里为数不多的定居点由悬挂在淤泥上的木质结构组成。大多数是建在树木之间的平台上，但也有一些是建在深入淤泥的高跷上。沼泽的泥土下没有坚实的土地，所以建在杆子上的房子最终会沉入泥土中。",
	"It is said that any object cast into the Swamp of Oblivion can't be found again for at least a century.

At its worst, it is cruel and wantonly destructive, as the efreet often are, but at its best, fire reflects the light of inspiration, the warmth of compassion, and the flame of desire.": "火代表活力、激情和变化。在最坏的情况下，它是残酷和肆意破坏的，就像伊夫里特人经常做的那样，但在最好的情况下，火反映了灵感的光芒、同情心的温暖和欲望的火焰。",
	"A blazing sun hangs at the zenith of a golden sky above the Plane of Fire, waxing and waning on a 24-hour cycle. It ranges from white hot at noon to deep red at midnight, so the darkest hours of the plane display a deep red twilight. At noon, the light is nearly blinding. Most business in the City of Brass (see below) takes place during the darker hours.": "一个炽热的太阳悬挂在火平面上方金色天空的天顶上，以24小时为周期不断升温和减弱。它的范围从中午的白热到午夜的深红，所以火界最黑暗的时间显示出深红色的黄昏。中午时分，光线几乎刺眼。黄铜城（见下文）的大部分业务都是在较暗的时段进行的。",

	"The heat in the Plane of Fire is comparable to a hot desert on the Material Plane, and poses a similar threat to travelers (see \"Extreme Heat\" in chapter 5, \"Adventure Environments\").

If it's possible to buy magic items at all, the City of Brass is the most likely place to find any item for sale, though the price might well be more than gold.

	"The nature of water is to flow, not like the gusting wind or the leaping flame, but smoothly and steadily. It is the rhythm of the tide, the nectar of life, the bitter tears of mourning, and the balm of sympathy and healing. Given time, it can erode all in its path.": "水的本性是流动，不像疾风或跳跃的火焰，而是平稳的、稳定的。它是潮汐的节奏，是生命的甘露，是哀伤的苦泪，是同情和治愈的香膏。只要有时间，它就能侵蚀其路径上的一切。",

	"Arborea is home to many elves and elven deities. Elves born on this plane have the celestial type and are wild at heart, ready to battle evil in a heartbeat. Otherwise, they look and behave like normal elves.": "Arborea是许多精灵和精灵神灵的家园。在这个平面上出生的精灵具有天人合一的类型，内心狂野，随时准备与邪恶战斗。除此之外，他们的外表和行为都与普通精灵一样。",
	"Keep track of how many days a visitor spends on Arborea. When the visitor leaves, it must make a Charisma saving throw against a DC of 5, plus 1 for each day spent on the plane. On a failed save, the creature becomes afflicted with a yearning to return to Arborea. As long as the effect persists, the creature has disadvantage on ability checks. At the end of each long rest, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. A {@i dispel evil and good} spell removes this effect from the creature.": "记录访客在Arborea上花费的天数。当来访者离开时，它必须对DC值为5的 \"魅力 \"进行拯救，在飞机上每呆一天加1。如果拯救失败，该生物就会受到渴望返回Arborea的折磨。只要效果持续，该生物就会在能力检查中处于劣势。在每次长期休息结束时，该生物可以重复拯救动作，如果成功则结束该效果。一个{@i dispel evil and good}的法术会从该生物身上移除这个效果。",
	"Ysgard is a rugged realm of soaring mountains, deep fjords, and windswept battlefields, with summers that are long and hot, and winters that are wickedly cold and unforgiving. Its continents float above oceans of volcanic rock, below which are icy caverns so enormous as to hold entire kingdoms of giants, humans, dwarves, gnomes, and other beings. Heroes come to Ysgard to test their mettle not only against the plane itself, but also against giants, dragons, and other terrible creatures that thunder across Ysgard's vast terrain.": "Ysgard是一个崎岖不平的王国，有高耸的山脉、深邃的峡湾和风吹日晒的战场，夏天漫长而炎热，冬天则是邪恶的寒冷和无情的。它的大陆漂浮在火山岩的海洋之上，下面是巨大的冰冷洞穴，可以容纳整个巨人、人类、矮人、侏儒和其他生物的王国。英雄们来到Ysgard，不仅是为了测试他们的能力，也是为了对抗巨人、龙和其他在Ysgard的广阔地形上打雷的可怕生物。",
	"Ysgard is the home of slain heroes who wage eternal battle on fields of glory. Any creature, other than a construct or undead, that is killed by an attack or a spell while on Ysgard is restored to life at dawn the next day. The creature has all its hit points restored, and all conditions and afflictions it suffered before its death are removed.": "Ysgard是被杀的英雄们的家园，他们在荣耀的战场上展开永恒的战斗。任何生物，除了构筑物或亡灵之外，如果在Ysgard上被攻击或咒语杀死，都会在第二天的黎明恢复生命。该生物的所有命中率都得到了恢复，而且它在死前遭受的所有状况和痛苦都被消除。",
	"Limbo is a plane of pure chaos, a roiling soup of impermanent matter and energy. Stone melts into water that freezes into metal, then turns into diamond that burns up into smoke that becomes snow, and on and on in an endless, unpredictable process of change. Fragments of more ordinary landscapes-bits of forest, meadow, ruined castles, and even burbling streams-drift through the disorder. The whole plane is a nightmarish riot.": "Limbo是一个纯粹的混沌平面，是由无常的物质和能量组成的沸腾汤。石头融化成水，水冻结成金属，然后变成钻石，钻石燃烧起来变成烟，变成雪，在一个无尽的、不可预测的变化过程中不断地变化。更为普通的景观碎片--森林、草地、废墟城堡，甚至潺潺的溪流--在无序中飘荡。整个平面是一场噩梦般的骚乱。",
	"Limbo has no gravity, so creatures visiting the plane float in place. A creature can move up to its walking speed in any direction by merely thinking of the desired direction of travel.": "Limbo没有重力，所以访问这个平面的生物会漂浮在原地。一个生物可以在任何方向上以其行走速度移动，只需想到想要的旅行方向。",
	"Limbo conforms to the will of the creatures inhabiting it. Very disciplined and powerful minds can create whole islands of their own invention within the plane, sometimes maintaining those places for years. A simpleminded creature such as a fish, though, might have less than a minute before the pocket of water surrounding it freezes, vanishes, or turns to glass. The slaadi live here and swim amid this chaos, creating nothing, whereas githzerai monks build entire monasteries with their minds.": "Limbo符合居住在其中的生物的意愿。非常有纪律和强大的头脑可以在这个平面内创造出他们自己发明的整个岛屿，有时可以将这些地方维持多年。然而，像鱼这样头脑简单的生物，在它周围的水袋冻结、消失或变成玻璃之前，可能只有不到一分钟的时间。斯拉迪人生活在这里，在这种混乱中游泳，什么也不创造，而吉斯泽拉僧侣则用他们的思想建造整个寺院。",
	"As an action, a creature on Limbo can make an Intelligence check to mentally move an object on the plane that it can see within 30 feet of it. The DC depends on the object's size: DC 5 for Tiny, DC 10 for Small, DC 15 for Medium, DC 20 for Large, and DC 25 for Huge or larger. On a successful check, the creature moves the object 5 feet plus 1 foot for every point by which it beat the DC.": "作为一个动作，在Limbo上的生物可以做一个智力测验，在精神上移动一个它能看到的30英尺范围内的平面物体。判定值取决于物体的大小。小的DC为5，小的DC为10，中的DC为15，大的DC为20，巨大或更大的DC为25。检验成功后，该生物会将物体移动5英尺，每超过DC一点就会增加1英尺。",
	"A creature can also use an action to make an Intelligence check to alter a nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried. The same rules for distance apply, and the DC is based on the object's size: DC 10 for Tiny, DC 15 for Small, DC 20 for Medium, and DC 25 for Large or larger. On a success, the creature changes the object into another nonliving form of the same size, such as turning a boulder into a ball of fire.": "一个生物也可以用一个行动来进行智力测验，以改变一个没有被穿戴或携带的非魔法物品。同样的距离规则也适用，DC是基于物体的大小。微型的DC为10，小型的DC为15，中型的DC为20，大型或更大的DC为25。如果成功，该生物会将该物体变成另一个相同大小的非生物形态，例如将一块巨石变成一个火球。",
	"Finally, a creature can use an action to make an Intelligence check to stabilize a spherical area centered on the creature. The DC depends on the radius of the sphere. The base DC is 5 for a 10-foot-radius sphere; each additional 10 feet added to the radius increases the DC by 5. On a successful check, the creature prevents the area from being altered by the plane for 24 hours, or until the creature uses this ability again.": "最后，一个生物可以使用一个动作来进行智力测验，以稳定以该生物为中心的球形区域。判定值取决于球体的半径。对于一个10英尺半径的球体来说，基础DC是5；半径每增加10英尺，DC就增加5。如果检定成功，该生物可以在24小时内防止该区域被飞机改变，或者直到该生物再次使用这个能力。",
	"Pandemonium is a plane of madness, a great mass of rock riddled with tunnels carved by howling winds. It is cold, noisy, and dark, with no natural light. Wind quickly extinguishes nonmagical open flames such as torches and campfires. It also makes conversation possible only by yelling, and even then only to a maximum distance of 10 feet. Creatures have disadvantage on any ability check that relies on hearing. Most of the plane's inhabitants are creatures that were banished to the plane with no hope of escape, and many of them have been driven mad by the incessant winds or forced to take shelter in places where the winds die down until they sound like distant cries of torment.": "潘德蒙是一个疯狂的平面，是一个巨大的岩石群，上面布满了由呼啸的风雕刻的隧道。这里寒冷、嘈杂、黑暗，没有自然光。风会迅速熄灭非魔法性的明火，如火把和营火。它还使对话只能通过大喊大叫来实现，即使如此也只能在10英尺的范围内进行。生物在任何依赖听觉的能力检查中都处于劣势。这个星球上的大多数居民都是被放逐到这个星球上的生物，他们中的许多人已经被连绵不绝的风逼疯了，或者被迫躲在风势减弱的地方，直到他们听起来像遥远的折磨的哭声。",
	"A visitor must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw after each hour spent among the howling winds. On a failed save, the creature gains one level of {@condition exhaustion}. A creature that reaches six levels of {@condition exhaustion} while on this plane doesn't die. Instead, the creature gains a random form of indefinite madness, as described in chapter 8, \"Running the Game.\" Finishing a long rest doesn't reduce a creature's {@condition exhaustion} level unless the creature can somehow escape the maddening winds.": "在呼啸的风中每过一小时，来访者必须做一个DC10的智慧救赎动作。如果救赎失败，该生物将获得一个（%0%）的等级。在这个平面上达到六级（%1%）的生物并不会死亡。相反，该生物会获得一种随机形式的无限期疯狂，如第8章 \"运行游戏 \"中所述。完成长时间的休息并不会降低生物的（%2%）等级，除非该生物能够以某种方式逃离疯狂的风。",
	"The Abyss embodies all that is perverse, gruesome, and chaotic. Its virtually endless layers spiral downward into ever more appalling forms.": "深渊体现了所有反常的、可怕的和混乱的东西。它几乎无穷无尽的层次螺旋式下降，形成更多骇人的形式。",
	"Each layer of the Abyss boasts its own horrific environment. Although no two layers are alike, they are all harsh and inhospitable. Each layer also reflects the entropic nature of the Abyss. In fact, much of what one sees or touches on the plane seems to be in a decaying, crumbling, or corroded state.": "深渊的每一层都拥有自己可怕的环境。虽然没有两层是相同的，但它们都是严酷和荒凉的。每一层也反映了深渊的熵的性质。事实上，人们在飞机上看到或接触到的大部分东西似乎都处于腐烂、崩溃或腐蚀的状态。",
	"A non-evil visitor that finishes a long rest in the Abyss must make a DC 10 Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the creature becomes corrupted. Refer to the Abyssal Corruption table to determine the effects of this corruption. You can substitute different corruption effects of your own creation.": "在深渊中完成长期休息的非邪恶访客必须做一个DC 10的魅力拯救动作。如果失败，该生物会被腐蚀。参照深渊腐蚀表来决定这种腐蚀的效果。你可以用你自己创造的不同的腐蚀效果来代替。",

A dispel evil and good spell or any magic that removes a curse also ends the effect.": "在完成长期休息后，被腐蚀的生物可以做一个DC 15的魅力救赎动作。拯救成功后，腐蚀效果结束。驱散邪恶和善良的咒语或任何可以消除诅咒的魔法也会结束这个效果。",
	"If a corrupted creature doesn't leave the plane within {@dice 1d4+2} days, its alignment changes to chaotic evil. Casting the {@spell dispel evil and good} spell on the creature restores its original alignment.": "如果被腐化的生物在{@dice 1d4+2}天内没有离开这个星球，它的方向会变成混乱的邪恶。对该生物施展{@spell dispel evil and good}的法术，可以恢复其原来的排列。",
	"{@bold Treachery.} The character gains the following flaw: \"I can only achieve my goals by making sure that my companions don't achieve theirs.\"": "{@bold Treachery.} 该人物获得以下缺陷：\"我只有通过确保我的同伴不能实现他们的目标，才能实现我的目标。\"",

	"Demogorgon's layer in the Abyss is a vast wilderness of savagery and madness known as the Gaping Maw, where even powerful demons go insane with fear. Reflecting Demogorgon's dual nature, the Gaping Maw consists of a massive primeval continent covered in dense jungle, surrounded by a seemingly endless expanse of ocean and brine flats. The Prince of Demons rules his layer from two serpentine towers, which emerge from a turbid sea. Each tower is topped with an enormous fanged skull. The spires constitute the fortress of Abysm, where few creatures can venture without descending into madness.": "德摩根在深渊中的一层是一个巨大的野蛮和疯狂的荒野，被称为 \"大嘴\"，在那里，即使是强大的恶魔也会因为恐惧而发疯。反映了德摩根的双重本性，大嘴由一个巨大的原始大陆组成，覆盖着茂密的丛林，周围是看似无尽的海洋和盐水滩。恶魔王子从两座蛇形塔中统治他的层级，这两座塔从浑浊的海中浮现出来。每座塔的顶部都有一个巨大的带獠牙的头骨。这些尖塔构成了阿比斯姆的堡垒，很少有生物能在这里冒险而不陷入疯狂。",
	"If Orcus had his way, all planes would resemble his dead realm of Thanatos, and all creatures would become undead under his control. Under its black sky, Thanatos is a land of bleak mountains, barren moors, ruined cities, and forests of twisted black trees. Tombs, mausoleums, gravestones, and sarcophagi litter the landscape. Undead swarm across the plane, bursting from their tombs and graves to tear apart any creatures foolish enough to journey here. Orcus rules Thanatos from a vast palace known as Everlost, crafted of obsidian and bone. Set within a howling wasteland called Oblivion's End, the palace is surrounded by tombs and burial sites dug into the sheer slopes of narrow valleys, creating a tiered necropolis.": "如果奥库斯得逞，所有的星球都会像他的死界塔纳托斯一样，所有的生物都会在他的控制下成为亡灵。在黑色的天空下，塔纳托斯是一片荒凉的山脉、贫瘠的荒野、破败的城市和扭曲的黑色树木的森林。坟墓、陵墓、墓碑和石棺遍布整个景观。亡灵蜂拥而至，从它们的墓穴和坟墓中冲出来，撕碎任何愚蠢到在这里旅行的生物。奥克斯（Orcus）在一个被称为 \"Everlost \"的巨大宫殿中统治着塔纳托斯，该宫殿由黑曜石和骨头制成。这座宫殿坐落在一片被称为 \"遗忘的尽头 \"的荒原上，周围是挖在狭窄山谷的陡峭斜坡上的坟墓和埋葬地，形成了一个层层叠叠的尸骨城。",
	"Lolth's layer is an immense network of thick, magical webbing that forms passageways and cocoon-like chambers. Throughout the web, buildings, structures, ships, and other objects hang as if caught in a spider's snare. The nature of Lolth's web creates random portals throughout the plane, drawing such objects in from demiplanes and Material Plane worlds that figure into the schemes of the Spider Queen. Lolth's servants also build dungeons amid the webbing, trapping and hunting Lolth's hated enemies within crisscrossing corridors of web-mortared stone.": "Lolth层是一个巨大的网络，由厚厚的、神奇的网状物组成，形成通道和茧状的房间。在整个网络中，建筑、结构、船只和其他物体就像被蜘蛛的圈套套住一样。洛尔思之网的性质在整个位面创造了随机的门户，将这些物体从半位面和物质位面的世界中吸引过来，这些都是蜘蛛女王的计划。洛尔思的仆人们还在网中建造了地牢，将洛尔思讨厌的敌人困在纵横交错的网状石头走廊中并加以猎杀。",

By Graz'zt's command, the demons of Azzagrat present a veneer of civility and courtly comity.

	"The layers of Hades are called the Three Glooms-places without joy, hope, or passion. A gray land with an ashen sky, Hades is the destination of many souls that are unclaimed by the gods of the Upper Planes or the fiendish rulers of the Lower Planes.

Planar travelers come here to conspire with devils and to close deals with night hags, rakshasas, incubi, succubi, and other fiends. Dispater collects a piece of every deal through special provisions that are added to contracts signed on his layer of the Nine Hells.": "第二层的名字来自于它目前的领主，迪斯派特。这位大公是个操纵者和欺骗者，他是个魔鬼般的帅哥，只有小角、尾巴和左蹄能将他与人类区分开来。他的深红色宝座矗立在迪斯铁城的中心，这是一个狰狞的大都市，是九层地狱中最大的城市。行星旅行者来到这里与魔鬼密谋，并与夜叉、拉克萨斯、妖精、琥珀和其他恶魔达成交易。迪斯派特通过在他的九层地狱上签订的合同中加入特殊条款，从每笔交易中分得一杯羹。",
	"Dispater is one of Asmodeus's most loyal and resourceful vassals, and few beings in the multiverse can outwit him. He is more obsessed than most devils with striking deals with mortals in exchange for their souls, and his emissaries work tirelessly to foster evil schemes in the Material Plane.": "迪斯派特是阿斯莫德最忠诚、最机智的附庸之一，多元宇宙中很少有生命能超越他。他比大多数魔鬼更痴迷于与凡人达成交易以换取他们的灵魂，他的使者不知疲倦地在物质世界中促进邪恶的计划。",
	"The third layer of the Nine Hells is a stench-ridden bog. Acidic rain spills from the layer's brown skies, thick layers of scum cover its putrid surface, and yawning pits lie in wait beneath the murk to engulf careless wanderers. Cyclopean cities of ornately carved stone rise up from the bog, including the great city of Minauros for which the layer is named.": "九层地狱的第三层是一个臭气熏天的沼泽。酸性雨水从这一层的棕色天空中溢出，厚厚的浮渣覆盖着腐烂的表面，阴暗处的大坑等待着吞噬不小心的流浪者。独眼巨人的城市从沼泽中升起，包括米瑙罗斯的大城市，该层也因此而得名。",
	"The slimy walls of the city rise hundreds of feet into the air, protecting the flooded halls of Mammon. The Archduke of Minauros resembles a massive serpent with the upper torso and head of a hairless, horned humanoid. Mammon's greed is legendary, and he is one of the few archdevils who will trade favors for gold instead of souls. His lair is piled high with treasures left behind by those who tried-and failed-to best him in a deal.": "粘稠的城墙耸立在数百英尺高的空中，保护着被淹没的玛门大厅。米瑙罗斯的大公像一条巨大的蛇，上身和头部是一个没有毛发的有角的人形。玛门的贪婪是个传奇，他是少数几个会用黄金而不是灵魂来换取恩惠的大恶魔之一。他的巢穴里堆满了那些试图在交易中胜过他的人留下的财宝，但都失败了。",
	"Phlegethos, the fourth layer, is a fiery landscape whose seas of molten magma brew hurricanes of hot wind, choking smoke, and pyroclastic ash. Within the fire-filled caldera of Phlegethos's largest volcano rises Abriymoch, a fortress city cast of obsidian and dark glass. With rivers of molten lava pouring down its outer walls, the city resembles the sculpted center piece of a gigantic, hellish fountain.": "第四层的菲勒盖索斯（Phlegethos）是一片火热的土地，熔化的岩浆海酝酿着热风、窒息的烟雾和火成灰的飓风。在菲勒盖索斯最大的火山的充满火焰的破火山口内，耸立着阿普里莫赫，一座由黑曜石和黑玻璃铸造的堡垒城市。熔化的熔岩河从外墙倾泻而下，这座城市就像一个巨大的、地狱般的喷泉的中心雕塑。",
	"Abriymoch is the seat of power for the two archdevils who rule Phlegethos in tandem: Archduke Belial and Archduchess Fierna, Belial's daughter. Belial is a handsome, powerfully built devil who exudes civility, even as his words carry an undercurrent of threat. His daughter is a statuesque devil whose beauty encases the blackest heart in the Nine Hells. The alliance of Belial and Fierna is unbreakable, for both are aware that their mutual survival hinges on it.": "阿布里莫克是两个大恶魔的权力所在地，他们共同统治着弗莱盖索斯。贝利亚大公和贝利亚的女儿菲尔娜大公。贝利亚是一个英俊的、身材强壮的魔鬼，他散发着文明的气息，即使他的话语中带有威胁的暗流。他的女儿是一个雕塑般的魔鬼，她的美貌包裹着九层地狱中最黑暗的心。贝利亚和菲尔纳的联盟是牢不可破的，因为他们都知道他们的共同生存取决于此。",
	"The fifth layer of the Nine Hells is a freezing realm of ice within which cold flames burn. A frozen sea surrounds the layer, and its gloomy sky crackles with lightning.": "九层地狱的第五层是一个冰冷的境界，里面燃烧着寒冷的火焰。一片冰冻的海洋围绕着这一层，阴暗的天空中闪烁着闪电。",
	"Archduke Levistus once betrayed Asmodeus and is now encased deep in the ice of Stygia as punishment. He rules this layer all the same, communicating telepathically with his followers and servants, both in the Nine Hells and on the Material Plane.": "莱维斯托斯大公曾经背叛了阿斯莫德，现在被包裹在冥府的冰层深处作为惩罚。他同样统治着这一层，与他的追随者和仆人进行心灵感应，无论是在九层地狱还是在物质位面。",
	"Stygia is also home to its previous ruler, the serpentine archdevil Geryon, who was dismissed by Asmodeus to allow the imprisoned Levistus to regain his rule. Geryon's fall from grace has spurred much debate within the infernal courts. No one is certain whether Asmodeus had some secret cause to dismiss the archdevil or whether he is testing Geryon's allegiance for some greater purpose.": "斯蒂吉亚也是其前任统治者的所在地，蛇形大魔鬼吉里昂，他被阿斯莫德解雇，以便让被囚禁的莱维斯特斯重新获得统治权。格里昂的堕落在地狱法庭内引发了许多辩论。没有人确定阿斯莫德是否有一些秘密的原因来解雇大恶魔，或者他是否为了某些更大的目的而测试格瑞恩的忠诚度。",
	"Malbolge, the sixth layer, has outlasted many rulers, among them Malagard the Hag Countess and the archdevil Moloch. Malagard fell out of favor and was struck down by Asmodeus in a fit of pique, while her predecessor, Moloch, still lingers somewhere on the sixth layer as an imp, plotting to regain Asmodeus's favor. Malbolge is a seemingly endless slope, like the sides of an impossibly huge mountain. Parts of the layer break off from time to time, creating deadly and deafening avalanches of stone. The inhabitants of Malbolge live in crumbling fortresses and great caves carved into the mountainside.": "Malbolge，第六层，已经超过了许多统治者，其中包括女巫Malagard和大恶魔Moloch。马拉加德失宠了，被阿斯莫德一怒之下打倒了，而她的前任，摩洛赫，仍然作为一个小恶魔徘徊在第六层的某个地方，谋求重新获得阿斯莫德的青睐。Malbolge是一个似乎没有尽头的斜坡，就像一座不可能的大山的两侧。该层的一部分不时地断裂，形成致命的、震耳欲聋的石头雪崩。马尔博格的居民生活在摇摇欲坠的堡垒和刻在山腰的巨大洞穴中。",
	"Malbolge's current archduchess is Asmodeus's daughter, Glasya. She resembles a succubus with her small horns, leathery wings, and forked tail. She inherited her cruelty and love of dark schemes from her father. The citadel that serves as her domicile on the slopes of Malbolge is supported by cracked pillars and buttresses that are sturdy yet seem on the verge of collapse. Beneath the palace is a labyrinth lined with cells and torture chambers, where Glasya confines and torments those who displease her.": "马尔博格的现任大公夫人是阿斯莫德的女儿，格拉西亚。她的小角、皮质的翅膀和分叉的尾巴类似于一个肉体。她从父亲那里继承了她的残忍和对黑暗计划的热爱。作为她在马尔博格山坡上的住所的城堡是由破裂的柱子和扶壁支撑的，这些柱子和扶壁很结实，但似乎处于崩溃的边缘。宫殿下面是一个迷宫，两边都是牢房和刑讯室，格拉西亚在那里禁锢和折磨那些令她不满的人。",
	"The seventh layer, Maladomini, is ruin-covered wasteland. Dead cities form a desolate urban landscape, and between them lie empty quarries, crumbling roads, slag heaps, the hollow shells of empty fortresses, and swarms of hungry flies.": "第七层，马拉多米尼，是被废墟覆盖的荒地。死亡的城市形成了荒凉的城市景观，在它们之间有空旷的采石场、摇摇欲坠的道路、矿渣堆、空荡荡的堡垒空壳，以及成群的饥饿苍蝇。",
	"The Archduke of Maladomini is Baalzebul, the Lord of Flies. A bloated fiend with the lower body of an enormous slug, Baalzebul's form was inflicted on him by Asmodeus as punishment for wavering loyalty. Baalzebul is a miserable and degenerate monstrosity who has long conspired to usurp Asmodeus, yet has failed at every turn. He carries a curse that causes any deal made with him to lead to calamity. Asmodeus occasionally shows Baalzebul favor for reasons no other archduke can fathom, though some suspect that the Archduke of Nessus still respects the worthiness of this fallen adversary.": "马拉多米尼的大公是巴勒泽布尔，苍蝇之主。巴尔泽布尔是一个臃肿的恶魔，下半身像一只巨大的鼻涕虫，他的形态是阿斯莫德施加给他的，作为对其忠诚度动摇的惩罚。巴尔泽布尔是一个悲惨而堕落的怪物，他长期以来一直在密谋篡夺阿斯莫德，但每次都失败了。他带着一个诅咒，导致任何与他达成的交易都会导致灾难的发生。阿斯莫德偶尔会因为其他大公无法理解的原因而对巴尔泽布尔示好，尽管有人怀疑内瑟斯大公仍然尊重这个堕落的对手的价值。",
	"Cania, the eighth layer of the Nine Hells, is an icy hellscape, whose ice storms can tear flesh from bone. Cities embedded in the ice provide shelter for guests and prisoners of Cania's ruler, the brilliant and conniving archdevil Mephistopheles.": "卡尼亚是九层地狱的第八层，是一个冰冷的地狱景象，其冰雪风暴可以撕裂肉体和骨头。嵌入冰层的城市为卡尼亚的统治者--聪明而狡猾的大魔鬼梅菲斯特--的客人和囚犯提供庇护。",
	"Mephistopheles dwells in the ice citadel of Mephistar, where he plots to seize the Throne of Baator and conquer the planes. He is Asmodeus's greatest enemy and ally, and the Archduke of Nessus appears to trust Mephistopheles's counsel when it is offered.": "梅菲斯特居住在梅菲斯特的冰雪城堡中，他在那里策划着夺取巴托尔王座并征服各个星球。他是阿斯莫德最大的敌人和盟友，内瑟斯大公似乎相信梅菲斯特提供的建议。",
	"Mephistopheles knows he can't depose Asmodeus until his adversary makes a grave miscalculation, and so both wait to see what circumstances might turn them against each other. Mephistopheles is also a godfather of sorts to Glasya, further complicating the relationship.": "梅菲斯特知道，除非他的对手出现严重的误判，否则他不可能废黜阿斯莫德，因此两人都在等待，看什么情况下会让他们彼此反目。梅菲斯特也是格拉西亚的某种教父，使双方的关系更加复杂。",
	"Mephistopheles is a tall, striking devil with impressive horns and a cool demeanor. He trades in souls, as do other archdevils, but he rarely gives his time to any creatures not worthy of his personal attention. His instincts are as razor sharp as Cania's frigid winds, and it is said that only Asmodeus has ever deceived or thwarted him.": "梅菲斯特是一个高大醒目的魔鬼，有着令人印象深刻的犄角和冷酷的举止。他和其他大恶魔一样，从事灵魂交易，但他很少把时间给任何不值得他亲自关注的生物。他的直觉就像卡尼亚的寒风一样锐利，据说只有阿斯莫德曾经欺骗或挫败过他。",
	"The lowest layer of the Nine Hells, Nessus is a realm of dark pits whose walls are set with fortresses. There, pit fiend generals loyal to Asmodeus garrison their diabolical legions and plot the conquest of the multiverse. At the center of the layer stands a vast rift of unknown depth, out of which rises the great citadel-spire of Malsheem, home to Asmodeus and his infernal court.": "内苏斯是九层地狱的最底层，是一个由黑暗坑道组成的领域，其墙壁上设置有堡垒。在那里，忠于阿斯莫德的坑魔将军们驻扎着他们邪恶的军团，策划着对多元宇宙的征服。在这一层的中心，矗立着一个未知深度的巨大裂缝，从那里升起了伟大的玛尔希姆城堡--阿斯莫德和他的地狱法庭的家。",
	"Malsheem resembles a gigantic hollowed-out stalagmite. The citadel is also a prison for souls that Asmodeus has locked away for safekeeping. Convincing him to release even one of those souls comes at a steep price, and it is rumored that the Archduke of Nessus has claimed whole kingdoms in the past for such favors.": "马尔希姆类似于一个巨大的中空石笋。这座城堡也是阿斯莫德锁住的灵魂的监狱，用于保存。说服他释放这些灵魂，哪怕是一个，也要付出高昂的代价，据传内瑟斯大公过去曾因为这样的恩惠而要求整个王国。",
	"Asmodeus most often appears as a handsome, bearded humanoid with small horns protruding from his forehead, piercing red eyes, and flowing robes. He can also assume other forms and is seldom seen without his ruby-tipped scepter in hand. Asmodeus is the most cunning and well-mannered of archdevils. The ultimate evil he represents can be seen only when he wills it so, or if he forgets himself and flies into a rage.": "阿斯莫德最常出现的样子是一个英俊的、有胡子的人形，额头上有小角突出，有一双刺眼的红眼睛，穿着流动的长袍。他也可以化身为其他形式，而且很少看到他不拿着红宝石尖的权杖。阿斯莫德是最狡猾和最有修养的大恶魔。他所代表的终极邪恶只有在他愿意的情况下才能看到，或者当他忘记了自己并陷入愤怒的时候。",
	"Acheron has four layers, each made of enormous iron cubes floating in an airy void. Sometimes the cubes collide. Echoes of past collisions linger throughout the plane, mingling with the sounds of armies colliding. That's the nature of Acheron: strife and war, as the spirits of fallen soldiers join in endless battle against orcs devoted to Gruumsh, goblinoids loyal to Maglubiyet, and legions assembled by other warmongering gods.": "Acheron有四层，每层都由漂浮在空气中的巨大铁立方体组成。有时这些立方体会发生碰撞。过去碰撞的回声在整个平面上徘徊，与军队碰撞的声音混合在一起。这就是阿克伦的本质：纷争和战争，因为阵亡士兵的灵魂加入到无休止的战斗中，与致力于格鲁姆什的兽人、忠于马格鲁比耶的地精以及其他好战的神灵组建的军团对抗。",
	"Acheron rewards a creature for harming other creatures by imbuing that creature with the strength to keep fighting. While on Acheron, a creature gains temporary hit points equal to half its hit point maximum whenever it reduces a hostile creature to 0 hit points.": "Acheron奖励一个伤害其他生物的生物，给该生物灌输继续战斗的力量。在Acheron上，当一个生物将一个敌对的生物降低到0点命中率时，它就会获得相当于其最大命中率一半的临时命中率。",
	"On Mechanus, law is reflected in a realm of clockwork gears, all interlocked and turning according to their measure. The cogs seem to be engaged in a calculation so vast that no deity can fathom its purpose. Mechanus embodies absolute order, and its influence can be felt on those who spend time here.": "在麦金努斯，法律体现在一个由钟表齿轮组成的领域，所有的齿轮都是环环相扣，按照它们的尺度转动。这些齿轮似乎都在进行着巨大的计算，以至于没有任何神灵能够理解其目的。麦格努斯体现了绝对的秩序，在这里呆过的人都能感受到它的影响。",
	"Modrons are the primary inhabitants of Mechanus. The plane is also home to the creator of the modrons: a godlike being called Primus.": "莫德隆是麦哲诺斯的主要居民。这个星球也是摩德隆人的创造者的家：一个被称为普利姆斯的神一样的存在。",
	"While on Mechanus, creatures always use the average damage result for attacks and spells. For example, an attack that normally deals {@dice 1d10+5} damage always deals 10 damage on Mechanus.": "在Mechanus上，生物总是使用攻击和法术的平均伤害结果。例如，通常造成{@dice 1d10+5}伤害的攻击在机械体上总是造成10伤害。",
	"At the end of each long rest taken on this plane, a visitor that isn't lawful neutral must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature's alignment changes to lawful neutral. The creature's alignment reverts to normal after one day spent on a plane other than Mechanus. Casting the dispel evil and good spell on the creature also restores its original alignment.": "在这个平面上的每次长休结束时，非合法中立的访客必须做一个DC 10的智慧救赎动作。拯救失败后，该生物的排列组合将变为合法的中性。在麦格纳斯以外的位面呆上一天后，该生物的排列方式会恢复正常。对该生物施展驱除邪恶和善的法术也会恢复其原来的排列。",
	"Arcadia thrives with orchards of perfectly lined trees, ruler-straight streams, orderly fields, perfect roads, and cities laid out in geometrically pleasing shapes. The mountains are unblemished by erosion. Everything on Arcadia works toward the common good and a flawless form of existence. Here, purity is eternal, and nothing intrudes on harmony.": "阿卡迪亚欣欣向荣，果园里的树木整齐划一，溪流笔直，田地井然有序，道路完美无缺，城市也以几何学上的悦目形状布局。山脉没有被侵蚀的痕迹。阿卡迪亚的一切都朝着共同的利益和无缺陷的存在形式而努力。在这里，纯洁是永恒的，没有什么能侵入和谐。",
	"Night and day are determined by an orb that floats above Arcadia's highest peak. Half of the orb radiates sunlight and brings about the day; the other half sheds moonlight and brings on the starry night. The orb rotates evenly without fail, spreading day and night across the entire plane.": "白天和黑夜是由漂浮在阿卡迪亚最高峰上的一个球体决定的。球体的一半散发着阳光，带来了白天；另一半散发着月光，带来了星夜。球体不停地均匀旋转，将白天和黑夜散布在整个平面上。",
	"The weather in Arcadia is governed by four allied demigods called the Storm Kings: the Cloud King, the Wind Queen, the Lightning King, and the Rain Queen. Each one lives in a castle surrounded by the type of weather that king or queen controls.": "阿卡迪亚的天气由四个结盟的半神管理，称为风暴之王：云王、风后、闪电王和雨后。每个人都住在一个城堡里，周围都是该国王或女王控制的天气类型。",
	"Hidden below Arcadia's beautiful mountains are numerous dwarven kingdoms that have withstood the passage of millennia. Dwarves born on this plane have the celestial type and are always brave and kindhearted, but otherwise they look and behave like normal dwarves.": "在阿卡迪亚美丽的山脉下隐藏着无数的矮人王国，它们经受住了千年的考验。在这个平面上出生的矮人具有天人合一的类型，他们总是勇敢而心地善良，但除此之外，他们的外表和行为都与普通矮人一样。",
	"While on this plane, creatures can't be frightened or poisoned, and they are immune to disease and poison.": "在这个平面上，生物不能被惊吓或毒害，他们对疾病和毒药免疫。",
	"A variety of realms exist between or beyond the other planes.": "在其他星球之间或之外存在着各种境界。",
	"The Outlands is the plane between the Outer Planes. It is the plane of neutrality, incorporating a little of everything and keeping all aspects in a paradoxical balance-simultaneously concordant and in opposition. The plane has varied terrain, with prairies, mountains, and shallow rivers.": "外域是介于外层平面之间的平面。它是一个中立的位面，包含了所有事物的一部分，并将所有方面保持在一个矛盾的平衡中--同时是和谐的，也是对立的。该位面拥有不同的地形，有草原、山脉和浅水河流。",
	"The Outlands is circular, like a great disk. In fact, those who envision the Outer Planes as a wheel point to the Outlands as proof, calling it a microcosm of the planes. That argument might be circular, since the arrangement of the Outlands inspired the idea of the Great Wheel in the first place.": "外域是圆形的，像一个大圆盘。事实上，那些将外域星球设想为一个轮子的人指出外域作为证据，称它是各星球的一个缩影。这种说法可能是循环的，因为外域的安排首先激发了大轮子的想法。",
	"Around the outside edge of the circle, evenly spaced, are the gate-towns: sixteen settlements, each built around a portal leading to one of the Outer Planes. Each town shares many of the characteristics of the plane where its gate leads. Planar emissaries often meet in these towns, so it isn't unusual to see strange pairings, such as a celestial and a fiend arguing in a tavern while sharing a fine bottle of wine.": "在圆环的外缘，均匀分布着门镇：16个定居点，每个都围绕着通往外星的一个门户而建。每个城镇都有其门户所在位面的许多特征。平面使者经常在这些城镇相遇，所以看到奇怪的配对并不罕见，比如一个天人和一个恶魔在酒馆里争论，同时分享一瓶好酒。",
	"Given the fact that you can ride a horse in the Outlands from a heaven to a hell, a planar-themed campaign can be set there without the need for planar travel. The Outlands is the closest the Outer Planes come to being like a world on the Material Plane.": "鉴于你可以在外域骑着马从天堂到地狱，一个以平面为主题的活动可以在那里进行，而不需要进行平面旅行。外域是外行星中最接近物质界的世界的地方。",

	"At the center of the Outlands, like the axle of a great wheel, is the Spire-a needle-shaped mountain that rises high into the sky. Above this mountain's narrow peak floats the ring-shaped city of Sigil, its myriad structures built on the ring's inner rim. Creatures standing on one of Sigil's streets can see the city curve up over their heads and-most disconcerting of all-the far side of the city directly overhead. Called the City of Doors, this bustling planar metropolis holds countless portals to other planes and worlds.": "在外域的中心，就像一个大轮子的轴，是尖塔--一座高耸入云的针形山。在这座山的狭长山峰之上，漂浮着环形城市西格尔，其无数的建筑都建在环形的内缘。站在Sigil街道上的生物可以看到城市在他们头顶上的曲线，最令人不安的是，城市的远方就在头顶。这座繁华的平面大都市被称为 \"门之城\"，拥有无数通往其他平面和世界的门户。",
	"Sigil is a trader's paradise. Goods, merchandise, and information come here from across the planes. The city sustains a brisk trade in information about the planes, particularly the command words or items required for the operation of particular portals. Portal keys of all kinds are bought and sold here.": "西格尔是一个商人的天堂。货物、商品和信息从各个位面来到这里。这座城市维持着关于各位面信息的活跃交易，尤其是特定传送门操作所需的命令语或物品。各种各样的传送门钥匙在这里被买卖。",
	"The city is the domain of the inscrutable Lady of Pain, a being as old as gods and with purposes unknown to even the sages of her city. Is Sigil her prison? Is she the fallen creator of the multiverse? No one knows. Or if they do, they aren't telling.": "这座城市是高深莫测的痛苦女士的领地，她和众神一样古老，其目的甚至连她的城市的圣人都不知道。Sigil是她的监狱吗？她是多元宇宙的堕落创造者吗？没有人知道。或者，如果他们知道，他们也不会说。",
	"Demiplanes are extra dimensional spaces that come into being by a variety of means and boast their own physical laws. Some are created by spells. Others exist naturally, as folds of reality pinched off from the rest of the multiverse. Theoretically, a plane shift spell can carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork would be extremely hard to acquire. The gate spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane.": "半位面是通过各种方式产生的超维空间，拥有自己的物理规律。有些是通过法术创造的。其他的则是自然存在的，就像从多元宇宙的其他部分捏出来的现实的褶皱。理论上，平面转换法术可以将旅行者带到一个半位面，但音叉所需的适当频率是非常难以获得的。假设施法者知道半位面的情况，大门法术就比较可靠。",
	"A demiplane can be as small as a single chamber or large enough to contain an entire realm. For example, a {@spell Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion} spell creates a demiplane consisting of a foyer with multiple adjoining rooms, while the land of Barovia (in the Ravenloft setting) exists entirely within a demiplane under the sway of its vampire lord, Strahd von Zarovich. When a demiplane is connected to the Material Plane or some other plane, entering it can be as simple as stepping through a portal or passing through a wall of mist.": "一个半位面可以小到一个房间，也可以大到包含整个王国。例如，一个{@spell Mordenkainen's magnificent mansion}的法术创造了一个由门厅和多个相邻房间组成的半位面，而巴罗维亚的土地（在Ravenloft的设定中）完全存在于一个半位面中，由其吸血鬼领主Strahd von Zarovich支配。当一个半位面与物质世界或其他位面相连时，进入它就像穿过一个传送门或穿过一堵雾墙那么简单。",
	"The Far Realm is outside the known multiverse. In fact, it might be an entirely separate universe with its own physical and magical laws. Where stray energies from the Far Realm leak onto another plane, matter is warped into alien shapes that defy understandable geometry and biology. Aberrations such as mind flayers and beholders are either from this plane or shaped by its strange influence.": "远界是在已知的多元宇宙之外。事实上，它可能是一个完全独立的宇宙，有自己的物理和魔法规律。当来自远界的游离能量泄漏到另一个位面时，物质就会被扭曲成异样的形状，违背了可理解的几何学和生物学原理。畸形人，如噬心者和持心者，要么来自这个位面，要么被其奇怪的影响所塑造。",
	"The entities that abide in the Far Realm itself are too alien for a normal mind to accept without strain. Titanic creatures swim through nothingness there, and unspeakable things whisper awful truths to those who dare listen. For mortals, knowledge of the Far Realm is a struggle of the mind to overcome the boundaries of matter, space, and sanity. Some warlocks embrace this struggle by forming pacts with entities there. Anyone who has seen the Far Realm mutters about eyes, tentacles, and horror.": "居住在远界本身的实体太过陌生，正常人的心智无法毫无压力地接受。泰坦尼克号的生物在那里的虚无中游动，难以启齿的东西向那些敢于倾听的人低声诉说可怕的真相。对于凡人来说，对远方世界的了解是一场克服物质、空间和理智界限的思想斗争。一些术士通过与那里的实体结成契约来拥抱这种斗争。任何见过远界的人都会嘀咕眼睛、触手和恐怖。",
	"The Far Realm has no well-known portals, or at least none that are still viable. Ancient elves once opened a vast portal to the Far Realm within a mountain called Firestorm Peak, but their civilization imploded in bloody terror and the portal's location-even its home world-is long forgotten. Lost portals might still exist, marked by an alien magic that mutates the area around them.": "远界没有众所周知的传送门，或者至少没有仍然可行的。古老的精灵曾经在一座名为火暴峰的山中打开了通往远界的巨大传送门，但他们的文明在血腥的恐怖中瓦解了，传送门的位置--甚至它的母体世界--也早已被遗忘。失落的传送门可能仍然存在，被一种外星魔法标记，使其周围的区域发生变异。",
	"Worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse. The most widely known worlds are the ones that have been published as official campaign settings for the D&D game over the years.
