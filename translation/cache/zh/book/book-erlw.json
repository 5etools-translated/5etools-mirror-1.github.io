	"The world of Eberron has a rich history built on heroic deeds, evolving magic, and the wounds of a long, devastating war. Action, adventure, good, evil, and a thousand shades of gray paint the landscape in broad strokes. Ancient mysteries await discovery so they can influence the world and its people.": "Eberron世界有着丰富的历史，它建立在英雄的事迹、不断发展的魔法以及长期的、毁灭性的战争的创伤之上。行动、冒险、正义、邪恶，以及无数的灰色阴影，都在大笔大笔地描绘着这个世界。古老的奥秘等待着人们去发现，从而影响这个世界和它的人民。",
	"Magic is built into the very fabric of the world. It pervades everyday life. It provides comforts and conveniences unknown in either the modern world or any world of medieval fantasy. Great cities where castles scrape the sky prosper throughout the continent of Khorvaire, and a thriving aristocracy of merchant families controls much of the world's economy thanks to the edge given them by the mysterious and rare dragonmarks. Its people harness magic as a tool—to build cities, to sail ships through the skies, and to create both wonders and weapons.": "魔法是建立在世界的结构中的。它弥漫在日常生活中。它提供了现代世界或任何中世纪幻想世界所不知道的舒适和便利。在整个霍尔韦尔大陆上，城堡在天空中飞舞，一个繁荣的商人家族贵族控制着世界经济的大部分，这要归功于神秘而稀有的龙纹给他们带来的优势。它的人民利用魔法作为工具，建造城市，在天空中航行，并创造奇迹和武器。",
	"Heroes come in all shapes and sizes, all classes and races. They travel the world, battling villains in instants of over-the-top action. And they unearth fabulous treasure, and deal with narrow escapes and ominous mysteries that are as likely to shed light on centuries of secrets as they are to threaten the world's safety.": "英雄有各种形状和大小，各种等级和种族。他们周游世界，在瞬息万变的行动中与恶棍搏斗。他们发掘出神奇的宝藏，处理险象环生和不祥的谜团，这些谜团既可能揭开几个世纪的秘密，也可能威胁到世界的安全。",
	"Eberron embraces swashbuckling action and pulp adventure while adding a layer of noir intrigue. Stories don't always end well, and there isn't a perfect answer to every problem. The Last War turned old allies into bitter enemies and destroyed an entire nation, leaving behind terrible scars. Crime and corruption lurk in the great cities of Khorvaire. Hidden dragons shape the course of history, and sinister fiends influence the dreams of the unwary. Yet mortal greed and ambition might prove more dangerous than any dragon or fiend. This darkness affords opportunities for a group of bold adventurers to make a difference—for better or for worse.": "Eberron拥抱了挥舞的动作和纸浆冒险，同时加入了一层黑色的阴谋。故事的结局并不总是好的，也不是每个问题都有完美的答案。最后的战争将旧的盟友变成了痛苦的敌人，摧毁了整个国家，留下了可怕的伤痕。犯罪和腐败潜伏在Khorvaire的伟大城市中。隐藏的龙塑造了历史的进程，阴险的魔鬼影响着不怀好意者的梦想。然而，凡人的贪婪和野心可能比任何龙或魔鬼更危险。这片黑暗为一群大胆的冒险家提供了改变现状的机会--无论好坏。",

	"What is Eberron? Here are the key things to know:": "什么是Eberron？以下是需要了解的关键事项。",
	"{@b 1. The Last War Has Ended—Sort Of}. The Last War plunged the continent of Khorvaire into civil war more than a century ago, shattering the Five Nations that made up the kingdom of Galifar. Just two years ago, the war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Thronehold and the establishment of twelve recognized nations and a tenuous peace. The conflicts, the anger, and the pain of the long war remain, however, and the new nations seek every advantage as they prepare for the next war to break out on the continent.": "{@b 1. The Last War Has Ended—Sort Of}. 一个多世纪前，最后一次战争使霍尔韦尔大陆陷入内战，使组成加利法尔王国的五个国家支离破碎。就在两年前，战争结束了，签署了《王权条约》，建立了12个公认的国家和脆弱的和平。然而，长期战争的冲突、愤怒和痛苦依然存在，新的国家在为大陆上爆发的下一场战争做准备时寻求一切优势。",
	"{@b 2. Dragonmarked Dynasties}. The great dragonmarked families are the barons of industry and commerce throughout Khorvaire and beyond. Their influence transcends political boundaries, and they remained mostly neutral during the Last War. Not technically citizens of any nation, the matriarchs and patriarchs of each house live in splendor within their enclaves and emporiums located throughout Khorvaire. These dynastic houses of commerce derive their power from dragonmarks—hereditary arcane sigils that manifest on certain individuals within the family, granting them limited but useful magical abilities associated with the trade guilds each family controls.": "{@b 2. Dragonmarked Dynasties}. 伟大的龙纹家族是整个Khorvaire及其他地区的工业和商业男爵。他们的影响力超越了政治边界，在最后的战争中他们大多保持中立。严格来说，他们并不是任何国家的公民，每个家族的族长和元老都在他们位于霍尔韦尔各地的飞地和商场里过着辉煌的生活。这些商业王朝的权力来自于龙纹--遗传性的奥术符号，这些符号体现在家族中的某些人身上，赋予他们与每个家族控制的贸易行会相关的有限但有用的魔法能力。",
	"{@b 3. Lands of Intrigue}. The war is over, and the nations of Khorvaire now try to build a new age of peace and prosperity. Ancient threats linger, however, and the world needs heroes to take up the cause. Nations compete on many levels—over economic dominance, political influence, territory, magical power, and more—each looking to maintain or improve its status by any means short of all-out war. Dragonmarked houses, churches both pure and corrupt, crime lords, monster gangs, psionic spies, arcane universities, secret societies, sinister masterminds, dragons, and a multitude of organizations and factions join the struggle for position and power in the aftermath of the Last War.": "{@b 3. Lands of Intrigue}. 战争结束了，Khorvaire的国家现在试图建立一个和平和繁荣的新时代。然而，古老的威胁仍然存在，世界需要英雄们来承担起这个责任。各个国家在许多层面上竞争，包括经济主导地位、政治影响、领土、魔法力量等等，每个国家都希望通过任何手段来维持或提高自己的地位，而不是通过全面战争。龙纹屋、纯洁和腐败的教会、犯罪首脑、怪物帮派、幻术间谍、奥术大学、秘密社团、阴险的主谋、龙，以及众多组织和派别都加入了最后战争后的地位和权力争夺战中。",
	"{@b 4. A Continent of Adventure}. From the jungles of Q'barra to the blasted hills and valleys of the Demon Wastes, from the skyscrapers of Sharn to the dinosaur-filled Talenta Plains, Eberron is a world of adventure. Adventures can draw heroes from one exotic location to another across the continent of Khorvaire. The quest for the Mirror of the Seventh Moon might take the heroes from a hidden mountain shrine in Darguun to a ruined castle in the Shadow Marches and finally to a dungeon deep below the Library of Korranberg. Through the use of magical transportation, heroes can reach a wide range of environments over the course of an adventure, and thus deal with a diverse assortment of monsters and other challenges.": "{@b 4. A Continent of Adventure}. 从Q'barra的丛林到恶魔荒原的爆炸山丘和山谷，从Sharn的摩天大楼到充满恐龙的Talenta平原，Eberron是一个冒险的世界。冒险可以把英雄们从一个异国情调的地方吸引到霍尔韦尔大陆上的另一个地方。对第七月之镜的探索可能会把英雄们从达尔古恩的一个隐秘的山间神殿带到阴影地带的一个破败的城堡，最后到科兰伯格图书馆下面的一个地牢。通过使用魔法运输工具，英雄们可以在冒险过程中到达广泛的环境，从而应对各种各样的怪物和其他挑战。",
	"{@b 5. A World of Magic}. The technology of Eberron has developed not through the advance of science but by the mastery of magic. The widespread use of magic pervades life in the cities and towns. Airships and rail transport make rapid travel across the continent possible. A working class of minor mages, called magewrights, uses spells to provide energy and other necessities. Advances in magic item creation have led to everything from self-propelled farming implements to sentient, free-willed beings created in artificers' forges. With the aid of rare crystals called dragonshards, dragonmarks can be made more powerful, elementals can be controlled and harnessed, and magic items can be crafted and shaped.": "{@b 5. A World of Magic}. Eberron的技术不是通过科学的进步而是通过对魔法的掌握而发展起来的。魔法的广泛使用充斥着城市和城镇的生活。飞船和铁路运输使跨越大陆的快速旅行成为可能。一个由小法师组成的工作阶层，被称为魔法师，利用法术提供能源和其他必需品。魔法物品创造的进步导致了从自走式农具到在工匠的锻造中创造的有知觉的、自由意志的生命的一切。在被称为龙石的稀有水晶的帮助下，龙印可以变得更加强大，元素可以被控制和驾驭，魔法物品也可以被制作和塑形。",
	"{@b 6. New Races}. In addition to the common player character races found in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, players can choose to play orc or goblinoid characters in Eberron. Or they can choose one of four new races: {@race changeling|ERLW|changelings}, {@race kalashtar|ERLW}, {@race shifter|ERLW|shifters}, and {@race warforged|ERLW}. Changelings have minor shapechanging abilities similar to those of doppelgangers. Kalashtar are planar entities merged with human hosts, giving them telepathic abilities. Shifters developed from the mixing of humans and lycanthropes, a union that grants them limited bestial abilities and feral instincts. The warforged are a constructed race created during the Last War, seeking to find its place in a post-war world.": "{@b 6. New Races}. 除了{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中常见的玩家角色种族外，玩家可以选择在Eberron中扮演兽人或哥布林人角色。或者他们可以从四个新种族中选择一个。{@race changeling|ERLW|changelings}, {@race kalashtar|ERLW}, {@race shifter|ERLW|shifters}, 和 {@race warforged|ERLW}。变身者拥有类似于二重身的轻微变身能力。Kalashtar是与人类宿主合并的平面实体，赋予他们心灵感应的能力。变形人由人类和狼人的混合发展而来，这种结合赋予他们有限的兽性能力和野性的本能。战神是在最后一次战争中创造出来的一个构造种族，他们试图在战后的世界中找到自己的位置。",
	"{@b 7. D&D with a Twist}. Every race, monster, spell, and magic item in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, and {@book Monster Manual|MM} has a place somewhere in Eberron, but it might not be the place you expect. Eberron has a unique spot in the D&D multiverse, and many familiar elements of the game play different roles in the world. In particular, mortal creatures are products of culture and circumstances, rather than the direct influence of the gods. As a result, you can't assume that a gold dragon is good or a beholder is evil; only in the case of celestials, fiends, and certain other creatures whose identity and worldview are shaped by magic (such as the curse of lycanthropy) is alignment a given.": "{@b 7. D&D with a Twist}. {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}、{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}和{@book Monster Manual|MM}中的每个种族、怪物、咒语和魔法物品都在Eberron的某个地方有一席之地，但可能不是你期望的地方。Eberron在D&D多元宇宙中有着独特的位置，许多熟悉的游戏元素在这个世界中扮演着不同的角色。特别是，凡人生物是文化和环境的产物，而不是诸神的直接影响。因此，你不能假设金龙是好的，或看守者是邪恶的；只有在天人、魔人和某些其他生物的身份和世界观由魔法塑造的情况下（如狼人的诅咒），才会有一致的看法。",
	"Every child knows the story of the Progenitor Dragons: Siberys, Eberron, and Khyber. In the dawn of time, these three cosmic beings created thirteen planes of existence, each embodying a concept. Their final work was the Material Plane, where all ideas would become manifest: a realm that could know war and peace, life and death, order and chaos. But cruel Khyber sought ultimate dominion over this new reality. She struck Siberys without warning and tore him apart. Eberron wrestled with Khyber and bound the traitor in her coils but could not defeat her. So Eberron became a living prison, a world that would forever contain Khyber's evil.": "每个孩子都知道始祖龙的故事：西伯利亚斯、艾伯伦和凯伯尔。在时间的黎明，这三个宇宙生物创造了13个存在的平面，每个平面都体现了一个概念。他们的最终作品是物质界，在那里所有的想法都将得到体现：一个可以知道战争与和平、生命与死亡、秩序与混乱的领域。但残酷的凯伯寻求对这个新现实的最终支配权。她毫无征兆地打击了西伯利亚，并将他撕碎。Eberron与Khyber搏斗，将叛徒捆绑在她的线圈中，但无法击败她。于是Eberron成为了一个活生生的监狱，这个世界将永远容纳Khyber的邪恶。",
	"Almost every culture in the world shares this story as a myth that explains the world. Shattered Siberys became the ring of golden dragonshards wrapped around the planet, said to be the source of magic. Eberron is the world, the source of all natural life. And Khyber is the Underdark and the source of aberrations and fiends, forever struggling against her bonds and yearning to destroy the world above.": "世界上几乎所有的文化都分享这个故事，作为解释世界的神话。碎裂的西伯利亚成为包裹着地球的金色龙鳞环，据说是魔法的来源。Eberron是世界，是所有自然生命的来源。而凯伯是地下世界，是反常者和恶魔的源头，永远在与她的束缚作斗争，渴望摧毁上面的世界。",
	"Another tale shared across cultures describes one more conflict that occurred in the first age of the world. Long ago, powerful archfiends known as the Overlords and their armies of rakshasa and lesser fiends dominated Eberron. Forces of light—some versions of the story say the nine gods of the Sovereign Host, others say an alliance of dragons and celestials—eventually defeated the Overlords. But these fiends couldn't be destroyed; instead, their immortal essences were bound in Khyber. Whatever the true details of this tale, this much is true: if the Overlords ever break their bonds, the consequences would be catastrophic.": "另一个跨文化共享的故事描述了发生在世界第一个时代的另一场冲突。很久以前，被称为 \"霸主 \"的强大的大恶魔和他们的罗刹和小恶魔的军队统治了Eberron。光明的力量--有些版本的故事说是主宰的九个神，有些说是龙和天人的联盟--最终打败了霸主。但这些恶魔无法被消灭；相反，他们不朽的精华被束缚在开伯尔。无论这个故事的真实细节如何，有一点是真实的：如果霸主们打破他们的束缚，后果将是灾难性的。",
	"Over the course of millennia, numerous civilizations rose only to fall. Giants built mighty kingdoms on the continent of Xen'drik that were devastated by a war with the dragons of Argonnessen. The goblin empire of Dhakaan ruled Khorvaire until its reign was shattered by an invading army of mind flayers, beholders, and the foul creatures that created them. Today these civilizations are known only through the remnants left behind.": "在几千年的时间里，许多文明都在崛起，却又在衰落。巨人在Xen'drik大陆上建立了强大的王国，但在与Argonnessen的龙的战争中遭到破坏。达卡安（Dhakaan）的地精帝国统治着霍尔韦尔，直到它的统治被一支入侵的心灵感应者、持有者和创造他们的肮脏生物的军队所粉碎。今天，这些文明只能通过留下的残余物来了解。",
	"In the modern age, the greatest power was the kingdom of Galifar, which covered most of the continent of Khorvaire. The Five Nations—Aundair, Breland, Karrnath, Thrane, and Cyre—formed the heart of the kingdom. Although each has a unique cultural identity, they share this unified foundation. Families are spread across the Five Nations; the rulers of the Five Nations descend from the Wynarns, the royal bloodline of Galifar. Despite their differences, an Aundairian has more in common with a Thrane than with a Zil gnome or a Lhazaar pirate.": "在现代，最强大的力量是加利法尔王国，它覆盖了霍尔韦尔大陆的大部分地区。五个国家--Aundair、Breland、Karrnath、Thrane和Cyre--构成了这个王国的核心。虽然每个国家都有独特的文化特征，但它们都有这个统一的基础。家庭分布在五国之间；五国的统治者都是加里法尔的皇室血统--怀纳恩的后代。尽管存在差异，但一个昂代尔人与瑟兰人的共同点要比与齐尔地精或拉扎尔海盗的共同点多。",
	"A century ago Galifar collapsed into civil war, and the Five Nations became separate countries at odds with their neighbors. The Last War came to an end after Cyre was destroyed in a cataclysm known as the Mourning. The Five Nations remain divided today, sharing Khorvaire with the new nations established by the Treaty of Thronehold. The remaining Five Nations remain the largest and most powerful countries in Khorvaire.": "一个世纪前，加利法尔陷入内战，五国成为与邻国不和的独立国家。在赛尔在一场被称为 \"哀悼 \"的大灾难中被摧毁后，最后的战争结束了。今天，五国仍然处于分裂状态，与《王权条约》所建立的新国家共享霍尔韦尔。剩下的五国仍然是霍尔韦尔最大和最强大的国家。",
	"The Treaty of Thronehold officially ended the Last War. The treaty recognized the following nations as sovereign states: Aundair, Breland, Darguun, the Eldeen Reaches, Karrnath, the Lhazaar Principalities, the Mror Holds, Q'barra, the Talenta Plains, Thrane, Valenar, and Zilargo. These nations abide by a common set of laws and maintain diplomatic relations. The Demon Wastes and Shadow Marches regions have no unified government. Droaam has declared itself a nation but has yet to be recognized by the treaty nations.": "王权条约》正式结束了最后一次战争。该条约承认以下国家为主权国家。昂代尔（Aundair）、布雷兰德（Breland）、达尔古恩（Darguun）、艾尔迪恩（Eldeen Reaches）、卡尔纳特（Karrnath）、拉扎尔（Lhazaar）公国、姆罗尔（Moror）领地、卡巴拉（Q'barra）、塔伦塔平原（Talenta Plains）、瑟兰、瓦勒纳和齐拉尔戈。这些国家遵守一套共同的法律并保持外交关系。恶魔荒原和阴影牧场地区没有统一的政府。Droaam已经宣布自己是一个国家，但还没有被条约国家承认。",
	"Although Eberron is a vast world with many continents and cultures, your adventures begin in the land of Khorvaire. Here are a few details about everyday life there.": "虽然Eberron是一个拥有许多大陆和文化的广阔世界，但你的冒险却从Khorvaire的土地上开始。这里有一些关于那里日常生活的细节。",
	"In Eberron, languages reflect culture and geography; a dwarf raised in Breland might not know Dwarvish, but a halfling raised in the Mror Holds might. The historical development of languages and cultures also explains the scripts used to write various languages. For example, the Orc language is written using the Goblin script (rather than Dwarvish, as stated in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}), because the orcs of Khorvaire learned writing from the goblins.": "在Eberron，语言反映了文化和地理；一个在Breland长大的矮人可能不知道矮人语，但一个在Moror Holds长大的半身人可能知道。语言和文化的历史发展也解释了用于书写各种语言的文字。例如，半兽人的语言是用地精文字书写的（而不是矮人文字，如{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中所述），因为霍尔韦尔的兽人从地精那里学会了书写。",
	"Common is the language of the Five Nations and the language of trade in Khorvaire, known by most of its people. Goblin was the trade language of the goblin empire of Dhakaan and survives as the primary language in Darguun, Droaam, and the Shadow Marches. Goblin displaced the Orc language; the people of the Shadow Marches typically speak Goblin, and Orc is an exotic language (see the Exotic Languages of Eberron table). Members of all races in Xen'drik speak Giant and use it as their trade language. Infernal is the common tongue of all fiends. Infernal is sometimes called \"Khyber's Speech,\" while Celestial is \"the tongue of Siberys.\"": "通用语是五国的语言，也是霍尔韦尔的贸易语言，为其大多数人所熟知。妖精语是达卡安的妖精帝国的贸易语言，并作为主要语言在达古恩、德罗阿姆和阴影地带生存。妖精语取代了兽人语；阴影地带的人们通常说妖精语，而兽人语是一种外来语言（参见《Eberron外来语言》表）。Xen'drik的所有种族成员都说巨人语，并将其作为他们的贸易语言。地狱语是所有魔族的共同语言。地狱语有时被称为 \"开伯尔之语\"，而天人语是 \"西伯利亚之语\"。",
	"With the DM's approval, you can exchange a language granted by your race for a different language from the Standard Languages of Eberron table. If your halfling was raised in the Mror Holds, you might replace Halfling with Dwarvish to reflect that background. The DM may change the languages assigned to a monster or NPC. An ogre from Droaam likely speaks Goblin instead of Giant.": "经DM批准，你可以将你的种族所赋予的语言换成Eberron标准语言表中的另一种语言。如果你的半身人是在Mror Holds长大的，你可以用矮人语代替半身人，以反映这一背景。DM可以改变分配给某个怪物或NPC的语言。一个来自Droaam的食人魔可能会说哥布林语而不是巨人语。",

	"Most citizens of Khorvaire have a given name followed by a surname. A surname associated with the Common language is usually either a family name or related to an occupation or region of origin.

	"The noble families of Galifar—along with those granted land and titles by one of the sovereigns of the Five Nations—add the prefix ir' to their surname. The name Darro ir'Lain tells you that this individual is a landed noble. The Wynarns were the royal line of Galifar, and the current rulers of Aundair, Breland, and Karrnath are all heirs of the Wynarn bloodline. Thus, Queen Aurala of Aundair is Aurala ir'Wynarn.": "加利法尔的贵族家庭--以及那些被五国君主之一授予土地和头衔的人--在他们的姓氏前加上ir'。Darro ir'Lain这个名字告诉你，这个人是一个有土地的贵族。怀纳恩家族是加利法尔的皇室血统，昂代尔、布雷兰德和卡尔纳特的现任统治者都是怀纳恩血统的继承人。因此，昂代尔的奥拉拉女王就是奥拉拉-伊尔-怀纳恩。",

However, while the designs imprinted on these coins vary based on the source, each of these factions has continued to use the same metals, weights, and denominations set forth in the days of Galifar, maintaining a simple standard for commerce across Khorvaire.": "商人和贵族使用信用证来处理大宗交易，动用Mror Holds的矮人银行的储备。但大多数日常交易都使用贵金属硬币。随着加利法尔王国的崩溃，五国中的每一个国家都开始铸造自己的货币，与Moror的银行家一起。然而，虽然印在这些硬币上的设计因来源而异，但这些派别中的每一个都继续使用加利法尔时代规定的相同金属、重量和面额，为整个霍尔韦尔的商业维持一个简单的标准。",
	"The copper crown (cp) traditionally depicts the crown of Galifar on one face. The crown is the lowest denomination of coin minted under the rule of Galifar, which spawned the saying, \"In Galifar, even the beggars have crowns.\"": "铜冠（cp）传统上是在一面描绘加利法尔的王冠。王冠是加利法尔统治时期铸造的最低面额的硬币，这也催生了一句话：\"在加利法尔，即使是乞丐也有王冠\"。",

	"Eberron is a world in need of heroes. Lingering tensions of war remain. From the fanatics of the Emerald Claw and the mad cults of the Dragon Below to the flesh-warping daelkyr and ancient archfiends, Eberron faces many threats, and few people besides the player characters are able to stop them. The gods are distant and don't directly intervene. The Silver Flame is a divine force of light, but it can act only through mortal champions. The few powerful benevolent NPCs have limitations: the Keeper of the Flame loses her powers if she leaves her citadel. The Great Druid, the spiritual leader of the Eldeen Reaches, is a tree. Most of the powerful people in the world focus on selfish goals. If an angry dragon attacks Sharn, there's no one else to deal with the problem: the fate of the city is in your hands.": "Eberron是一个需要英雄的世界。挥之不去的战争紧张局势依然存在。从翡翠之爪的狂热者和龙下之城的疯狂邪教，到肉体扭曲的daelkyr和古老的大恶魔，Eberron面临着许多威胁，而除了玩家角色之外，很少有人能够阻止他们。诸神是遥远的，不会直接干预。银色火焰是一种神圣的光的力量，但它只能通过凡人的冠军来行动。少数强大的仁慈的NPC也有限制：火焰的守护者如果离开她的城堡就会失去她的力量。大德鲁伊（Great Druid）是Eldeen Reaches的精神领袖，他是一棵树。世界上大多数有权势的人都专注于自私的目标。如果一条愤怒的龙袭击了沙恩，没有其他人可以处理这个问题：城市的命运掌握在你手中。",
	"Consider a dynamic backstory when developing your character and choosing your background, whether you take a background from the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} or the house agent background in {@book chapter 1|ERLW|1} of this book. If you take the soldier background, you might have played a role in events of the last few years. What did you do during the Last War? What was your greatest triumph or defeat? If you're a spy, are you a prized agent or did you disavow your organization after they pushed you too far? Don't think of your character as a set of numbers: even at 1st level, you're remarkable in Eberron.": "在发展你的角色和选择你的背景时，考虑一个动态的背景故事，无论你采取的是本书（%0%）中的背景还是（%1%）中的房屋经纪人背景。如果你采取士兵的背景，你可能在过去几年的事件中扮演了一个角色。你在上次战争中做了什么？你最大的胜利或失败是什么？如果你是一个间谍，你是一个受人尊敬的特工，还是在你的组织把你逼得太紧之后，你放弃了你的组织？不要把你的角色看成是一组数字：即使是一级，你在Eberron也是很了不起的。",
	"What's better than a battle on the deck of an airship? A battle on the deck of an airship that's about to crash! A DM should look for ways to raise the stakes of an Eberron scene, so players feel that every decision matters. This could be driven by the consequences of failure: your actions protect your friends, your house, or your nation. It could involve time: the alarm's been triggered, and you only have 6 rounds before security arrives. Such things can even be incidental. Did you start a fight in an alley behind a bar? Now you notice the drunk ogre sleeping in the shadows. If she wakes up, this could get ugly.": "有什么比飞艇甲板上的战斗更精彩？那就是在即将坠毁的飞艇甲板上的战斗。DM应该寻找方法来提高Eberron场景的赌注，使玩家感到每一个决定都很重要。这可能是由失败的后果驱动的：你的行动会保护你的朋友、你的房子或你的国家。它可能涉及到时间：警报被触发了，在保安到达之前你只有6个回合的时间。这种事情甚至可以是偶然的。你是不是在酒吧后面的小巷里挑起了一场战斗？现在你注意到那个醉醺醺的食人魔在阴影中睡觉。如果她醒了，情况可能会变得很糟糕。",
	"Eberron is rich in villains, from two-bit hoods to continental masterminds. It might be a long time before you're ready to face the sinister leader behind the Order of the Emerald Claw in battle. But part of the flavor of pulp adventure includes recurring villains who closely match the heroes—rivals who advance in power as you do.": "Eberron的反派人物非常多，从二流子到大陆的主谋。在你准备好在战斗中面对翡翠之爪骑士团背后的邪恶领袖之前，可能还需要很长一段时间。但纸浆冒险的部分风味包括反复出现的与英雄密切相关的反派--随着你的力量提升的对手。",
	"To create a compelling villain, the DM and players might develop a villain's backstory together. A DM might ask a player: {@i When you fought in the Last War, Halas Martain served in your unit until he betrayed you. What did he do, exactly?} Likewise, when a pulp villain appears to die, they can devise remarkable escapes from death. Perhaps Halas had a ring that cast an illusion of his death while stabilizing him or cast {@spell feather fall} when he leapt from that tower in Sharn. A DM could engage the players in determining the answer: {@i It's Halas Martain, all right. How do you think he survived your last encounter?} This collaboration can produce a compelling story and a sense of investment in the world.": "为了创造一个令人信服的反派，管理员和玩家可能会一起开发一个反派的背景故事。DM可能会问玩家。{@i When you fought in the Last War, Halas Martain served in your unit until he betrayed you. What did he do, exactly?}同样地，当一个纸醉金迷的反派出现死亡时，他们可以设计出非凡的逃脱死亡的方法。也许Halas有一个戒指，在稳定他的同时投下了死亡的幻觉，或者在他从Sharn的那座塔上跳下时投下（%1%）。管理者可以让玩家参与确定答案。{@i It's Halas Martain, all right.

As you consider a flaw for your character, you can add a little hard-boiled flavor by considering the past: Did you make a tragic mistake, and if so, is it something you can ever undo? Did you hurt or betray someone who now seeks revenge? The Regrets table provides a few examples of missteps that might haunt you.": "玩家角色是了不起的人，但他们并不完美。当你考虑你的角色的缺陷时，你可以通过考虑过去来增加一点硬朗的味道。你是否犯了一个悲惨的错误，如果是的话，你是否能挽回？你是否伤害或背叛了某人，而他现在正在寻求报复？遗憾表提供了一些可能困扰你的失误的例子。",

	"A regret helps shape your personality as an element of your past that plays an ongoing role in your story. But perhaps you have a problem that needs to be resolved right now. Another way to define a character's flaw is to roll on the Debts table.": "遗憾有助于塑造你的个性，作为你过去的一个元素，在你的故事中发挥着持续的作用。但也许你现在就有一个需要解决的问题。另一种定义人物缺陷的方法是在债务表上滚动。",
	"Why would you want to take on a debt? The obligation adds depth to a character and provides a compelling, immediate motive for adventuring—you're not just out to get rich; you need gold to get that bounty off your head. It's also an opportunity to establish an element that can be part of a character moving forward. If you're trying to reclaim a magic item from a pawnshop, you declare that your character once owned that magic item—an heirloom, something you created, or a gift from a mentor—you've just temporarily lost it. If you're trying to raise money to join a secret society, it suggests that membership in this organization may be a part of the story later on.": "你为什么要承担债务？债务增加了角色的深度，并为冒险提供了令人信服的直接动机--你不只是为了发财；你需要金子来把赏金从你头上拿下来。这也是一个机会，可以建立一个可以成为角色前进的一部分的元素。如果你想从当铺取回一件魔法物品，你要声明你的角色曾经拥有这件魔法物品--一件传家宝，你创造的东西，或者导师的礼物--你只是暂时失去了它。如果你想筹钱加入一个秘密组织，这表明加入这个组织可能是以后故事的一部分。",
	"Establishing a debt requires collaboration and approval by both player and DM. Work together to develop the details: Who's blackmailing you? Which secret society are you trying to join?

	"Not every conflict involves a fight between light and darkness. The vast majority of people are driven by simple motives: greed, fear, pride, or ambition.

A leader guiding their nation into war is motivated both by fear of their neighbors and the sincere belief that Khorvaire would be better off under their rule.": "并非每一场冲突都涉及到光明与黑暗之间的斗争。绝大多数人都被简单的动机所驱使：贪婪、恐惧、骄傲或野心。一个人只想在自己的口袋里得到一些金子。另一个人想给姘头留下好印象。一个引导他们的国家进入战争的领导人，既是出于对邻国的恐惧，也是真诚地相信霍尔韦尔在他们的统治下会变得更好。",
	"Primordial forces strive to change or destroy Eberron. But more often, characters encounter misguided patriots, religious extremists, dragonmarked houses looking to wring a few more pieces of gold out of Khorvaire, spies who will do anything to protect their nations, and petty criminals trying to build empires. Eberron holds a place for selfless heroes and truly vile villains, as well as everyone in between.": "原始的力量试图改变或摧毁Eberron。但更多时候，角色们会遇到误入歧途的爱国者、宗教极端分子、希望从霍尔韦尔那里多榨取几块金子的龙纹家族、为保护国家不惜一切代价的间谍，以及试图建立帝国的小罪犯。Eberron为无私的英雄和真正卑鄙的恶棍，以及介于两者之间的每个人提供了一个位置。",
	"In Eberron, it's not always easy to separate the heroes from the villains. Good people can do terrible things, while cruel or heartless people might serve the greater good. An inquisitor might torture innocents in a quest to root out a cult of the Dragon Below; if she's stopped, the cult will survive and flourish. A group of orcs periodically raids a human settlement because the settlers built their village on land sacred to the orcs and are disrupting wards that hold evil at bay. The heroes find a powerful magic weapon in a tomb, but the artifact is the sword of an ancient hobgoblin general, whose descendants want it back. The ways to resolve these problems aren't always simple.": "在Eberron，要区分英雄和恶棍并不容易。好人可以做可怕的事情，而残忍或无情的人则可能为更大的利益服务。一个审问者可能会在寻求根除 \"下龙 \"邪教的过程中折磨无辜者；如果她被阻止了，这个邪教就会生存并发展壮大。一群兽人定期袭击一个人类定居点，因为定居者在兽人的圣地上建造了他们的村庄，并破坏了阻止邪恶的防护措施。英雄们在一座坟墓中发现了一件强大的魔法武器，但这件艺术品是古代妖精将军的剑，他的后人想要回它。解决这些问题的方法并不总是简单的。",

	"In a noir story, things don't necessarily end well. But any adventure carries a risk of death or failure, so what additional factors might be at risk for the characters? They should have something to lose beyond hit points, vulnerabilities not reflected in game statistics: fear of a tarnished reputation, a threat to a friend or lover, a favorite business destroyed or taken over. Character relationships require players to invest in the story and work best when the DM and player collaborate to develop details (the {@book group patrons|ERLW|4} in chapter 1 provide a framework for fleshing out such details).": "在一个黑色的故事中，事情不一定有好结果。但任何冒险都有死亡或失败的风险，那么对人物来说，还有什么额外的因素可能会有风险？除了命中率之外，他们还应该有一些可以失去的东西，即游戏统计中没有反映出来的弱点：害怕名誉受损、朋友或爱人受到威胁、最喜欢的生意被毁或被接管。角色关系需要玩家投入到故事中去，当DM和玩家合作开发细节时，效果最好（第一章中的（%0%）提供了一个充实这些细节的框架）。",
	"A DM who introduces an old buddy who served with the player characters during the war could describe the person and then ask each player to define a connection to them. Present each player with a prompt: {@i Player one, how did Smitty save your life?

	"Two main options provide long-distance travel across land. Major cities in Khorvaire are linked by the lightning rail of House Orien, which allows you to avoid the perils—and tedium—of the roads.

This grueling conflict left deep scars on the land and the people, but there was worse to come. On 20 Olarune 994 YK, the nation of Cyre was consumed in a magical cataclysm now known as the Mourning.

Shock and fear brought the nations to the negotiating table, and the Last War came to an end in 996 YK with the Treaty of Thronehold.": "最后的战争是一场痛苦的斗争，永远改变了霍尔韦尔的形态。那是一个以联盟变化为标志的世纪，多年的僵局与激烈的战斗交织在一起。这场艰苦的冲突给这片土地和人民留下了深深的伤痕，但更糟糕的事情还在后面。在994年奥拉鲁恩20日，赛尔国家在一场被称为 \"哀悼 \"的魔法大灾难中被吞噬。哀悼的原因仍然不明；许多人担心它是由战争魔法的无节制使用造成的。震惊和恐惧将各国带到了谈判桌上，最后的战争在公元996年以《王权条约》结束。",

	"Before the Last War, Galifar laid claim to all Khorvaire. Several new states emerged over the course of the war. In some cases, this was largely a formality; Galifar never had a strong grip on the Lhazaar Principalities or the gnome nation of Zilargo, and they held the Demon Wastes in name only. Other states were born in violence: the elves of Valenar and the goblins of Darguun seized their realms by force. But Aundair yearns to reclaim the Eldeen Reaches, Breland keeps a wary eye on the monstrous kingdom of Droaam, and many mistrust the Valenar elves. Within the Five Nations, anger remains over how the final lines were drawn; for example, Thrane retains control of the ancient Aundairian city of Thaliost, seized during the war.": "在最后一次战争之前，加利法尔对整个霍尔韦尔提出了要求。在战争过程中出现了几个新的国家。在某些情况下，这在很大程度上是一种形式；加利法尔从未对拉扎尔公国或齐拉尔戈的地精国有过强有力的控制，他们只是名义上拥有恶魔荒原。其他国家在暴力中诞生：瓦勒纳的精灵和达尔古恩的地精通过武力夺取了他们的王国。但昂代尔（Aundair）渴望夺回艾尔迪恩河谷（Eldeen Reaches），布雷兰（Breland）对德罗阿姆（Droaam）的畸形王国保持警惕，许多人不信任瓦伦纳（Valenar）的精灵。在五国内部，人们对最后的分界线仍然心存愤怒；例如，瑟兰仍然控制着在战争中被夺取的昂代尔古城--塔利奥斯特。",
	"The borders between nations demonstrate the impact of generations of conflict. Forests and farmlands scorched by fire and magic are still recovering. Ruined cities have yet to be reclaimed, along with shattered villages and abandoned fortresses. These deserted sites now provide shelter for brigands or are haunted by the restless spirits of those who died in anguish.": "国家之间的边界显示了几代人的冲突所带来的影响。被火和魔法烧焦的森林和农田仍在恢复中。被毁坏的城市还没有被收回，还有破碎的村庄和废弃的堡垒。这些荒废的地方现在为强盗提供庇护，或者被那些在痛苦中死去的人的不安的灵魂所困扰。",
	"This damage reached far beyond the front lines. Magic-fueled weapons, aerial cavalry, and guerrilla forces all struck deep within enemy territory, and the cities of Khorvaire suffered. Wherever you go, you might see the scorch marks of fireballs or wreckage from siege weapons. Every nation is working to repair these wounds, but the damage could linger for generations.": "这种损害远远超出了前线。以魔法为燃料的武器、空中骑兵和游击队都在敌人的领土深处进行打击，霍尔韦尔的城市也遭受了损失。无论你走到哪里，你都可能看到火球的焦痕或攻城武器的残骸。每个国家都在努力修复这些伤痕，但损害可能会持续几代人。",

Former nobles now have nothing but rags, and scholars or artists live in alleyways.": "难民生活在每个主要城市，包括成千上万因赛尔的毁灭而产生的流亡者。赛尔人是一个没有祖国的民族，他们在曾经的敌人的土地上寻求庇护和寄托。许多赛伦难民是前士兵，他们在哀伤袭来时正在敌人的领土上作战，或者他们是农民和商人，在他们的国家被吞噬之前逃跑了。昔日的贵族现在除了衣衫褴褛外一无所有，而学者或艺术家则住在巷子里。",
	"Cities and towns still suffer from shortages in the aftermath of the war. Farmlands, workers, and the resources devoted to the war were lost.

Others say that dead-gray mists rose in the capital city of Metrol and spread from there. Within the space of one day, the nation of Cyre had been engulfed in a wall of mist, and anything caught within the mists was horrifically transformed. Over a million Cyrans were killed on the day of Mourning. Those who survived were soldiers fighting in enemy territory, those living on the borders who were able to flee from the advancing mists, and those few who were able to escape the interior through magical means. On 20 Olarune 994 YK, the nation of Cyre ceased to exist.": "关于悼念活动的说法不一。有人说，一道刺眼的光芒吞噬了赛伦路附近的战场。还有人说，死灰色的迷雾在首都梅特罗尔升起，并从那里蔓延开来。在一天的时间里，赛尔国被一堵雾墙吞没了，任何被卷入雾中的东西都被可怕地改变了。在哀悼日当天，超过一百万赛尔人被杀。那些幸存下来的人是在敌方领土上作战的士兵，那些生活在边界的人能够从推进的迷雾中逃离，以及那些少数能够通过魔法手段逃离内部的人。在公元994年奥拉鲁恩20日，赛尔国不复存在。",
	"The Mourning threw Khorvaire into a state of shock. Who could unleash such power? Was this a weapon, and if so, when would those responsible issues their demands? Were the borders of the lingering walls of mist stable, or could they expand at any moment? What was to be done with the Cyran refugees surging into every adjacent nation? Fear of the Mourning ended the war. But all those questions remain unanswered.": "哀悼会使霍尔韦尔陷入了震惊之中。谁能释放出这样的力量？这是一种武器吗？如果是的话，那些负责任的人何时会提出他们的要求？挥之不去的迷雾之墙的边界是否稳定，或者它们随时都可能扩大？该如何处理涌入每一个邻近国家的赛伦难民呢？恐惧的哀伤结束了战争。但所有这些问题仍未得到解答。",
	"Breland opened its borders to refugees, and Prince Oargev serves as de facto ruler in the area now called New Cyre. Despite its grand name, New Cyre is little more than a vast refugee camp. Other refugees scattered across Khorvaire; some are treated with pity, others with suspicion or anger. And fear of the Mourning hangs like a shadow across Khorvaire. Could it happen again? Is this how the world ends?": "布雷兰德向难民开放边界，奥格夫王子在现在被称为新赛尔的地区担任事实上的统治者。尽管新赛尔的名字很宏伟，但它不过是一个巨大的难民营。其他难民分散在霍尔韦尔各地；有些人受到怜悯，有些人受到怀疑或愤怒。而对哀伤的恐惧像阴影一样笼罩着整个Khorvaire。它可能再次发生吗？世界就是这样结束的吗？",
	"A wall of dead-gray mist surrounds the remnants of Cyre. Beyond the mists lies a land twisted by magic, a wound that will not heal. The blasted land is strangely transformed. In some places, the ground has fused into jagged glass. In others, it is cracked and burned. Broken bodies of soldiers from various sides litter the landscape—soldiers whose dead bodies refuse to decompose. The Mournland is a vast open grave.": "一道死灰色的雾墙围绕着赛尔的遗迹。迷雾之外是一片被魔法扭曲的土地，一个无法愈合的伤口。这片被炸毁的土地发生了奇怪的变化。在一些地方，地面已经融合成锯齿状的玻璃。在其他地方，它是裂开和烧毁的。来自不同阵营的士兵的碎尸遍布这片土地--那些尸体拒绝腐烂的士兵。哀牢地是一个巨大的露天坟墓。",
	"In that horrific landscape, vile magical effects linger, and monsters mutate into even more foul and horrible creatures. Magical effects continue to rain upon the land as storms that never dissipate. Stories speak of living spells—war magic that has taken physical form, sentient fireballs and vile cloudkills that endlessly search for new victims. And angry ghosts continue to fight their final battles.": "在那片恐怖的土地上，卑劣的魔法效果挥之不去，怪物们变异成更加肮脏和恐怖的生物。魔法效应像风暴一样持续不断地降临在这片土地上，永不消散。故事中提到了活生生的咒语--具有物理形态的魔法，有生命的火球和卑鄙的云杀，无休止地寻找新的受害者。愤怒的鬼魂继续进行着他们最后的战斗。",
	"The only thing predictable about the Mournland is that nothing is predictable; any sort of monster or horror could lurk within its borders. And yet it also holds the wealth and treasures of an entire nation, along with the secrets of House Cannith and everything else that was left behind. It's dangerous. It's mysterious. But it's also a dungeon the size of a nation, with opportunities for those brave enough to enter the mists.": "哀牢地唯一可以预测的是，没有什么是可以预测的；任何种类的怪物或恐怖都可能潜伏在它的边界内。然而，它还拥有整个国家的财富和宝藏，以及坎尼斯家族的秘密和其他一切遗留下来的东西。它很危险。它是神秘的。但它也是一个相当于一个国家大小的地牢，为那些有勇气进入迷雾的人提供了机会。",
	"In making an Eberron character, think about the impact the Mourning had on you. If you're from Cyre, did you lose all your family and friends? Are there heirlooms lost in the mists that you're determined to regain, or loved ones you hope to someday see again? Do you feel loyalty to your nation and hope to see it restored, or have you burned Cyre out of your heart?": "在制作Eberron角色时，想想哀伤对你的影响。如果你是赛尔人，你是否失去了所有的家人和朋友？是否有遗失在迷雾中的传家宝，而你决心要夺回，或者你希望有一天能再次见到亲人？你是否对你的国家感到忠诚，并希望看到它得到恢复，或者你已经把赛尔城从你的心中烧掉了？",
	"Even if you're not from Cyre, the Mourning may have had a profound impact on you. Are you afraid that the Mourning could consume all of Khorvaire, or do you prefer not to dwell on such things? If you're religious, did the shocking tragedy of the Mourning cause you to question your faith, or did it reinforce it? If you're an artificer or a wizard, are you interested in studying its effects more closely. Might you even hope to unravel its mysteries yourself? Do you see it solely as a tragedy, or do you hope that this awesome power could somehow be harnessed?": "即使你不是来自赛尔，哀悼也可能对你产生了深刻的影响。你是害怕哀伤会吞噬整个霍尔韦尔，还是不愿意纠结于这种事情？如果你有宗教信仰，哀悼会令人震惊的悲剧是导致你质疑你的信仰，还是加强了它？如果你是一个工匠或巫师，你是否有兴趣更仔细地研究它的影响。你甚至可能希望自己揭开它的神秘面纱？你是仅仅把它看作是一场悲剧，还是希望这种可怕的力量能够以某种方式被利用？",
	"Perhaps you were caught in the Mourning and survived the experience, but its effects remain with you. Consider the following aftereffects of your experience:": "也许你被卷入了哀悼中，并在这次经历中幸存下来，但它的影响仍然伴随着你。考虑一下你的经历的以下后遗症。",
	"As a barbarian, you could have been a simple peasant caught in the Mourning. Everyone else in your community was killed, but their spirits were bound to you.

	"As a warlock, your patron could be interested in the Mourning and drive you to learn more about it. Your patron could even be part of the Mourning—perhaps a collective of spirits killed on the Day of Mourning, or a dark and enigmatic power that might have been responsible for this tragedy.

Or do you believe that you siphon power from it and weaken it with your actions?": "作为一个术士，你的守护者可能对哀伤感兴趣，并促使你去了解更多关于它的信息。你的守护者甚至可以是哀悼的一部分--也许是在哀悼日被杀的灵魂的集体，或者是可能对这场悲剧负责的黑暗和神秘的力量。如果你采取后一种方法，你是否觉得通过使用你的术士魔法，你在为哀悼服务？或者你认为你从它那里抽走了力量，用你的行为削弱了它？",

A fragment of the Prophecy might say, \"If the Bear King is slain by a sorrowful assassin in the Shadow of the Mourning, the Crown will fall from his nation.\" The \"Bear King\" could refer to King Boranel of Breland, since the bear is Breland's heraldic beast. The \"Shadow of the Mourning\" could mean that Boranel must be slain in the Mournland, or it could mean that the assassination must occur on the anniversary of the Mourning. This passage doesn't say that Boranel will be assassinated or that the Brelish monarchy will fall; it suggests that if Boranel is assassinated under these conditions, then the monarchy will surely fall.

	"Tens of thousands of years ago, the dragons of Argonnessen established a garrison of dragonborn in what is now Q'barra. These warriors were assigned to protect the region against the influence of the Lords of Dust. Over time they drifted away from their duties, building a nation in eastern Khorvaire and clashing with the goblinoids of the Dhakaani Empire.": "数万年前，阿贡尼森的龙族在现在的Q'barra建立了一支龙裔驻军。这些战士被指派保护该地区免受尘土领主的影响。随着时间的推移，他们偏离了自己的职责，在霍尔韦尔东部建立了一个国家，并与达卡尼帝国的妖精们发生了冲突。",
	"This dragonborn nation came crashing down when one of the ancient fiendish Overlords stirred, unleashing fiends and corrupting many of the dragonborn themselves. Their nation in ruins, the dragonborn retreated to the darkness of Q'barra. They have remained there ever since, guarding against corruption and fighting the evil forces of the Poison Dusk—which is sometimes described as a cult devoted to a dragon, and sometimes as an army gathering in the name of a fiendish Overlord.": "这个龙裔国家在一个古老的恶魔霸主的搅动下轰然倒塌，释放出恶魔并腐蚀了许多龙裔自己。他们的国家成了一片废墟，龙裔们撤退到了黑暗的Q'barra。从那时起，他们一直呆在那里，防止腐败，并与毒黄昏的邪恶势力作斗争--毒黄昏有时被描述为对龙的崇拜，有时被描述为以魔鬼般的霸主之名聚集的军队。",
	"To date the dragonborn have largely ignored the humans of Q'barra, and the few humans who've encountered dragonborn believe they're some exotic type of lizardfolk. If you're a dragonborn, what has caused you to emerge from Q'barra? Are you on a quest to help your people or to oppose the Lords of Dust? Are you driven by wanderlust or curiosity? Did you serve as a mercenary in the Last War? How might your travels tie to the fate of your people?": "迄今为止，龙裔在很大程度上忽视了Q'barra的人类，少数遇到龙裔的人类认为他们是某种外来的蜥蜴人。如果你是龙裔，是什么导致你从Q'barra出现？你是为了帮助你的人民还是为了反对尘土领主？你是被游荡的欲望还是好奇心驱使？你是否在最后一场战争中充当过雇佣兵？你的旅行与你的人民的命运可能有什么联系？",

	"The origin of the dwarves is shrouded in mystery. Some of their legends tell of a great migration that led the ancient dwarves to Khorvaire from \"a land of endless ice.\" Many believe this refers to the arctic lands of the Frostfell, while others claim that the first dwarves must have come from the frozen plane of Risia. Wherever their roots, these migrant dwarves established a mighty nation beneath the surface of Khorvaire.": "矮人的起源被蒙上了一层神秘的面纱。他们的一些传说讲述了一次大迁徙，导致古代矮人从 \"无尽的冰雪之地 \"来到霍尔韦尔。许多人认为这指的是冰霜之城的北极之地，而其他人则声称第一批矮人一定来自里西亚的冰冻平面。无论他们的根在哪里，这些迁徙的矮人在霍尔韦尔的地表下建立了一个强大的国家。",
	"Most dwarven legends, unconcerned with the question of origin, dwell on the mighty artifacts and priceless treasures crafted by ancient deep-dwelling dwarves, and of the bloody wars they waged against the goblin Empire of Dhakaan. Dwarves today cherish the memory of this ancient nation, for all dwarves in Khorvaire are descended from exiles driven from the realm below—which was later destroyed by the daelkyr. Particularly in the Mror Holds, many dwarves cherish the idea of returning to the subterranean reaches and reestablishing their ancient nation, restoring them to a greatness they have all but forgotten.": "大多数矮人的传说并不关心起源的问题，而是停留在古代深居简出的矮人所制作的强大神器和无价之宝，以及他们对达卡安的地精帝国发动的血腥战争。今天的矮人珍惜这个古老国家的记忆，因为霍尔韦尔的所有矮人都是被赶出地下王国的流亡者的后代--这个王国后来被戴尔基尔摧毁。特别是在Moror Holds，许多矮人珍视回到地下世界并重建他们的古老国家的想法，使他们恢复到他们已经完全遗忘的伟大。",
	"The dwarves of the Mror Holds are defined in part by their relationship to the ancient Realm Below. In a desperate effort to rediscover and reclaim the holdings of their old nation, the dwarves have recovered many weapons of war created in the final days of the empire. Some of these weapons were forged by the dwarves to wield against the daelkyr, but others were made by the daelkyr for the use of their minions—strange symbiotic items (some of which appear in {@book chapter 5|ERLW|12}) that use the life force of their hosts to power their magical abilities.": "摩尔大陆的矮人部分是由他们与古老的下层世界的关系决定的。为了重新发现和夺回他们古老国家的财产，矮人找到了许多在帝国最后时期制造的战争武器。其中一些武器是矮人为了对抗达尔凯尔而铸造的，但另一些则是达尔凯尔为他们的奴仆所制造的--奇怪的共生物品（其中一些出现在{@book chapter 5|ERLW|12}中），它们利用宿主的生命力来增强其魔法能力。",
	"Some clans have banned the use of these symbiotic weapons and any exploration of daelkyr magic, notably the prominent Clan Mroranon. Others, particularly Clan Soldorak, have embraced this magic to use against the daelkyr. Defining a relationship to these discoveries can be an important element of your character's background; you might be a Mroranon paladin or ranger dedicated to expunging any trace of daelkyr magic from the Realm Below, or a Soldorak warlock drawing on the magic of Xoriat in pursuit of your own power, as well as glory for your clan.": "一些部族禁止使用这些共生武器和对达尔凯尔魔法的任何探索，特别是著名的莫洛伦部族。其他人，特别是索多拉克氏族，已经接受了这种魔法来对抗达尔凯尔。定义与这些发现的关系可以成为你的角色背景的一个重要元素；你可能是一个致力于将任何daelkyr魔法的痕迹从下层世界中清除的Mroranon圣骑士或游侠，或者是一个为追求自己的力量以及为你的部族争取荣耀而吸取Xoriat魔法的Soldorak术士。",
	"Another important question to consider in playing a Mrorian character is why you have left the Holds. The Leaving the Mror Holds table offers some suggestions that might spark further ideas.": "在扮演Mororian角色时要考虑的另一个重要问题是你为什么要离开Holds。离开Mor's Holds表提供了一些建议，可能会引发进一步的想法。",
	"A feud with a rival clan has gotten out of hand, and it's best that you spend a few decades away from the Holds while things cool down.": "与一个敌对部族的争斗已经失去控制，在事情冷却的时候，你最好离开霍尔兹几十年。",
	"You come from a large family and there's no room for you to shine in your hold, so you hope to make a name for yourself in the wider world.": "你来自一个大家庭，在你的牵制下，没有空间让你发光，所以你希望在更广阔的世界里为自己扬名。",
	"Your clan has arranged your marriage and your future, and you've decided to have a few adventures before you settle down.": "你的宗族已经安排好了你的婚姻和你的未来，你决定在安顿下来之前进行一些冒险。",

	"You want to assemble champions who can help you explore the ancient ruins beneath your ancestral home.": "你想召集能够帮助你探索祖先家园下面的古代遗迹的冠军。",
	"You've rejected your clan's attitude toward daelkyr magic, earning the enmity of powerful dwarves.": "你拒绝了你的部族对daelkyr魔法的态度，赢得了强大矮人的敌意。",
	"You want to understand how the other peoples of Khorvaire—especially the goblins and orcs—have fought the daelkyr.": "你想了解霍尔韦尔的其他民族--尤其是哥布林和兽人--是如何与戴尔克尔作战的。",
	"Dwarves are spread across Khorvaire. Dwarf soldiers and engineers were part of the armies that united the Five Nations, and dwarf masons laid the foundations of the greatest cities of Galifar. Traditionally loyal to family and clan, dwarves who were born outside the Mror Holds tend to transfer their fierce clan loyalty to their new homes—and particularly to the edifices of stonework that symbolize the permanence and stability of those places. A Brelish dwarf might feel a deep, personal connection to the towers of Sharn or the great walls of Wroat; some dwarves love the great Cathedral of the Silver Flame in Thrane more than devout followers of the Silver Flame. Ultimately, the typical dwarf in wider Khorvaire is more patriotic than the average human of the Five Nations, and many dwarves fought for their nations in the Last War, at least for a time.": "矮人分布在整个霍尔韦尔。矮人士兵和工程师是统一五国的军队的一部分，矮人石匠奠定了加利法尔最伟大城市的基础。传统上忠于家庭和部族的矮人，出生在Moror Holds之外的矮人倾向于将他们激烈的部族忠诚度转移到他们的新家--尤其是象征着这些地方的永久性和稳定性的石制品建筑。一个布雷利什矮人可能会对沙恩的塔楼或沃鲁特的大墙感到深深的个人联系；一些矮人比银焰的虔诚追随者更喜欢瑟兰的银焰大教堂。归根结底，大范围的霍尔韦尔的典型矮人比五国的普通人类更爱国，许多矮人在最后的战争中为他们的国家而战，至少有一段时间。",
	"When creating a dwarf character from the Five Nations, consider both your national loyalty and the role your family plays in your life. Do you live near family? What kind of work do your closest family members pursue, and is that reflected in the background you choose? Are you close to your relatives, or have you had a falling out? Did you lose kin in the Last War?": "当创建一个来自五国的矮人角色时，既要考虑你对国家的忠诚度，也要考虑你的家庭在你生活中所扮演的角色。你住在家庭附近吗？你最亲近的家人从事什么样的工作，这是否反映在你选择的背景中？你和你的亲戚关系密切吗，或者你们之间有分歧吗？你在上次战争中失去了亲属吗？",
	"The Mark of Warding appears on dwarves of House Kundarak, which had its origins as one of the clans of the Mror Holds. Kundarak dwarves live across Khorvaire while maintaining close ties to the Mror Holds and their loyalty to the house over any particular nation.": "守护印记出现在昆达拉克家族的矮人身上，该家族起源于莫洛霍尔的一个部族。昆达拉克矮人生活在霍尔韦尔各地，同时与莫尔霍尔家族保持着密切的联系，他们对家族的忠诚度高于任何特定国家。",
	"In addition to providing all manner of security, House Kundarak dominates Khorvaire's banking industry. As a dragonmarked house, it is obliged to remain neutral in the politics of all nations, including its homeland. As a result, Clan Kundarak is no longer represented on the Iron Council that rules the Mror Holds. However, it wields an influence over the other clans that reflects its wealth and its status in the world beyond the Holds, and the voice of Kundarak members arguing against the use of daelkyr magic carries significant weight.": "除了提供各种形式的安全保障外，昆达拉克家族还主导着霍尔韦尔的银行业。作为一个有龙纹的家族，它有义务在所有国家的政治中保持中立，包括它的祖国。因此，昆达拉克家族在统治摩尔大陆的铁议会中不再有代表。然而，它对其他部族的影响反映了它的财富和它在霍尔兹以外的世界的地位，昆达拉克成员反对使用达尔凯尔魔法的声音具有重要的影响力。",
	"Put up your swords and talk of peace, or hide behind your walls of stone. When the host of Valenar thunders forth, neither will save you.": "举起你们的剑，谈论和平，或者躲在你们的石墙后面。当瓦勒纳的大军来袭时，两者都无法拯救你们。",
	"Tens of thousands of years ago, the elves of the distant continent of Xen'drik rose up against the giants who ruled over them. This rebellion is the defining event in elf history. As the ancient war progressed, the magebreeders of the giants bound magic into the elves who remained loyal to them, forming the drow—assassins bred to prey on their other kin. Ultimately, the elves fled from Xen'drik and settled the island nation of Aerenal, where they split into two distinct cultures: the introspective Aereni and the warlike Tairnadal. Thus, a war nearly forty thousand years ago established the pattern of how elves live today.": "数万年前，遥远的Xen'drik大陆的精灵们奋起反抗统治他们的巨人。这次叛乱是精灵历史上的决定性事件。随着古代战争的进行，巨人的魔法师们将魔法束缚在那些忠于他们的精灵身上，形成了专门猎杀其他亲属的乌鸦刺客。最终，精灵们逃离了Xen'drik，定居在Aerenal岛国，在那里他们分裂成两种不同的文化：内向的Aereni和好战的Tairnadal。因此，近四万年前的一场战争奠定了今天精灵们的生活模式。",
	"Neither the Aereni nor the Tairnadal (which include the elves of Valenar) have much interest in human activities, but small numbers of elves have immigrated to Khorvaire over the centuries and have more or less integrated with the cultures of the Five Nations. The drow, though, are virtually unknown on Khorvaire.": "Aereni和Tairnadal（包括Valenar的精灵）都对人类的活动没有太大的兴趣，但几个世纪以来，有少量的精灵移民到了Khorvaire，并或多或少地融入了五国的文化。不过，克罗人在霍尔韦尔几乎无人知晓。",
	"As a whole, elves are driven by tradition and respect for the past. Where humans value innovation, elves strive to master and perfect the techniques of their ancestors over the course of studies lasting centuries. Elf society has changed little over the last five thousand years, while Khorvaire is constantly evolving. Whatever the origin of your elf character, consider your relationship with the past: Do you value the traditions of your ancestors? Or do you fear that your people are too mired in the past, and need to find a way to adapt and move forward?": "作为一个整体，精灵们被传统和对过去的尊重所驱动。人类重视创新，而精灵则努力掌握和完善他们祖先的技术，并进行持续几个世纪的研究。在过去的五千年里，精灵社会没有什么变化，而霍尔韦尔则在不断地发展。无论你的精灵角色的起源是什么，请考虑你与过去的关系。你是否重视你祖先的传统？或者你担心你的人民过于沉溺于过去，而需要找到一种适应和前进的方法？",
	"For thousands of years, the island nation of Aerenal has been ruled and protected by the godlike power of the Undying Court, a council of undead high elves. The greatest heroes of the Aereni join the Undying Court after death, joining their heroic ancestors in immortality.": "几千年来，艾瑞纳岛国一直被不死阁的神力所统治和保护，不死阁是由不死的高等精灵组成的议会。艾瑞尼人最伟大的英雄在死后加入不死阁，与他们的英雄祖先一起永生。",
	"The Aereni are isolationists who have little interest in the world beyond their island. The Five Nations are a place of chaos and war, so why would any sensible elf venture into that madness? As you make an Aereni elf character, decide what has caused you to leave your island home and the protection of the Undying Court in order to wander the world. Are you in search of a power that could earn you your place in the Undying Court? Have you been given a quest by one of your own deathless ancestors? Or are you an exile, banished from your homeland for some crime against your people's rulers?": "艾瑞尼人是孤立主义者，对他们岛屿以外的世界没有什么兴趣。五国是一个充满混乱和战争的地方，那么为什么任何明智的精灵都要冒险进入那个疯狂的世界呢？当你塑造一个艾瑞尼精灵的角色时，请决定是什么原因导致你离开你的岛屿家园和不死阁的保护，以便在世界范围内游荡。你是否在寻找一种可以让你在不朽之庭获得地位的力量？你是否被你自己的不死鸟祖先之一赋予了任务？或者你是一个流亡者，因为对你的人民统治者犯下的一些罪行而被放逐出你的家园？",
	"Consider your character's personal and family history. What is your family known for, and how can you prove yourself to be a master of these skills? Do you have ancestors in the Undying Court, and if so, what's your relationship with them? Do you find it challenging to deal with the short-lived races, or are you patient with them?": "考虑你的角色的个人和家庭历史。你的家族以什么著称，你怎样才能证明自己是这些技能的主人？你是否有祖先在不死阁，如果有，你与他们的关系如何？你觉得与短命的种族打交道有挑战性吗，还是你对他们有耐心？",
	"Tairnadal elves dedicate themselves to the arts of war. The greatest heroes of the Tairnadal's many wars—against giants, dragons, and the champions of Dhakaan—live on after death, becoming the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal. Upon reaching adulthood, a Tairnadal elf forms a bond with one of these ancestors and strives to follow in the footsteps of this ancestor, living as the patron did. In this way, the champion comes to embody their ancestor, allowing the dead to live on.": "泰尔纳达尔精灵将自己奉献给了战争艺术。泰尔纳达尔众多战争中最伟大的英雄--对抗巨人、龙和达卡安的冠军--在死后仍然活着，成为泰尔纳达尔的守护神。成年后，泰尔纳达尔精灵会与这些祖先之一建立联系，并努力追随这位祖先的脚步，像守护者一样生活。通过这种方式，冠军来体现他们的祖先，让死者继续生存下去。",
	"The Tairnadal have three distinct lines: the Draleus Tairn, the Silaes Tairn, and the Valaes Tairn. All three lines roam the northern plains of Aerenal, having left the forest long ago, but the Valaes Tairn now reside mostly in Valenar, being the Tairnadal most often encountered in Khorvaire. Despite sharing a homeland with the Aereni, the Tairnadal have distinct religious traditions, revering their patron ancestors rather than the Undying Court.": "泰尔纳达尔人有三个不同的血统：德拉雷斯-泰尔纳、西拉斯-泰尔纳和瓦拉斯-泰尔纳。这三个系都在艾瑞纳北部平原游荡，很久以前就离开了森林，但瓦莱斯-泰恩现在主要居住在瓦勒纳，是在霍尔韦尔最经常遇到的泰恩达人。尽管与艾瑞尼人同属一个家园，但泰尔纳达尔人有独特的宗教传统，他们敬仰自己的守护神祖先，而不是不朽的法庭。",
	"In creating a Tairnadal character, including a Valenar elf, think about your patron ancestor. Most Tairnadal pursue the same class as their patron, so if your character is a wizard, your ancestor was likely a legendary archmage. Was your ancestor a famous blademaster, a stealthy hunter, or a war chanter? Were they chivalrous or merciless? Bold or clever? Whatever their path, it is your duty to follow their example. Is this something you proudly embrace, or do you resist it? Do you know another elf with the same patron ancestor, and what's your relationship to that character? Do you know an elf whose patron ancestor was a bitter rival of yours?": "在创建泰尔纳达尔角色时，包括瓦伦纳精灵，要考虑到你的守护者祖先。大多数泰尔纳达尔人追求的是与他们的守护者相同的等级，所以如果你的角色是一个巫师，你的祖先很可能是一个传奇的大法师。你的祖先是著名的爆破师、隐秘的猎人，还是战神？他们是侠义的还是无情的？大胆还是聪明？无论他们的道路如何，你都有责任以他们为榜样。这是你自豪地接受的东西，还是你抵制的东西？你是否认识另一个有相同守护者祖先的精灵，你和那个人物有什么关系？你是否知道一个精灵的守护者祖先是你的一个劲敌？",
	"Also consider why you are traveling with a group of player characters (who are presumably not also members of your war band) instead of serving with the Tairnadal. Do you experience visions of your patron ancestor driving you on a particular course? Are you pursuing an epic quest that mirrors your ancestor's legendary deeds? Are you seeking vengeance for the death of a friend or ally? Or have you turned away from your people, either by choice or because of the actions of a rival?": "还要考虑为什么你要和一群玩家角色（他们应该不是你的战队成员）一起旅行，而不是为泰尔纳达尔人服务。你是否经历过你的守护神祖先的幻觉，驱使你走上一条特殊的道路？你是否在追寻一个反映你祖先传奇事迹的史诗般的任务？你是否在为朋友或盟友的死亡寻求复仇？或者你已经远离了你的人民，无论是出于选择还是因为对手的行为？",

	"Throughout history, elves have occasionally migrated to live among the other peoples of Khorvaire. On rare occasions, entire families have relocated (as House Phiarlan did, almost three thousand years ago), but more often wanderers and exiles have come to Khorvaire and made their way there. Many of the finest wizards and most renowned artisans in the Five Nations are high elves. Wood elves are found among the rangers and druids of the Eldeen Reaches and stalking the darkest alleys of Sharn.": "纵观历史，精灵们偶尔会迁移到Khorvaire的其他民族中生活。在极少数情况下，整个家族都会搬迁（就像皮亚伦家族在近三千年前所做的那样），但更多的时候，流浪者和流亡者会来到霍尔韦尔，并在那里发展。五国中许多最好的巫师和最著名的工匠都是高等精灵。在Eldeen Reaches的游侠和德鲁伊中可以找到木精灵，在Sharn的最黑暗的小巷中也可以找到木精灵。",
	"As an elf born and raised in Khorvaire, your character has grown up among the shorter-lived races. You might not be as concerned with history and tradition as the Aereni and Tairnadal; you could even live your life entirely in the moment, with no care for your family or your legacy. Or you could be fascinated by the history and traditions of your ancestors and try to relearn the ways your family has forgotten.": "作为一个在霍尔韦尔出生和长大的精灵，你的角色在寿命较短的种族中成长起来。你可能不像Aereni和Tairnadal那样关注历史和传统；你甚至可以完全活在当下，不关心你的家庭或你的遗产。或者你可以对你祖先的历史和传统着迷，并试图重新学习你的家族所遗忘的方式。",
	"Consider also whether you've outlived human friends and how that might affect you. Did you know the parents or grandparents of another member of your party? Are you trying to repay a debt or fulfill a promise to that long-dead friend, or are you trying to recapture some spark of the friendship you felt years ago? Do you remember a time before the Last War? Did you fight in the war?": "还要考虑你是否已经超过了人类的朋友，这可能会对你产生什么影响。你是否认识你党内另一位成员的父母或祖父母？你是想向那位早已去世的朋友偿还债务或履行承诺，还是想重拾多年前的友谊的一些火花？你还记得最后一次战争之前的一个时期吗？你在战争中战斗过吗？",
	"Long ago on the continent of Xen'drik, the first drow fought beside the giants against the other elves. Tens of thousands of years have passed, and drow and other elves remember each other only as figures in their legends. The Undying Court and the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal remember the drow, but they have little occasion to teach their living descendants about these shadows of the distant past.": "很久以前，在Xen'drik大陆上，第一批乌鸦与巨人一起战斗，对抗其他精灵。几万年过去了，乌鸦和其他精灵都只记得对方是他们传说中的人物。不朽的法庭和泰尔纳达尔的祖先记得乌鸦，但他们很少有机会向他们活着的后代传授这些遥远的过去的影子。",
	"When the elves fled to Aerenal, the drow remained on Xen'drik as subjects of the giants, and they were caught in the collapse of giant civilization. Today they linger on Xen'drik and have set their own course, free of the giants' malevolent influence.": "当精灵们逃到阿伦纳时，乌鸦作为巨人的臣民留在了Xen'drik，他们被卷入了巨人文明的崩溃之中。今天，他们在Xen'drik徘徊，并确定了自己的方向，摆脱了巨人的恶意影响。",
	"Three distinct drow cultures formed after the fall of the giants. The most numerous are the Vulkoori, hunters dedicated to a scorpion god called Vulkoor. They hunt giants and other dangers in their lands. Led by powerful druids and wizards, the Sulatar cling to traditions of elemental shaping that date back to the Age of Giants. They live in a handful of obsidian cities across Xen'drik, and believe that they are destined to cleanse the world in a fiery apocalypse. Finally, the Umbragen are descended from drow who fled into the depths of the earth when the giant civilization fell. They wield sophisticated magic in their unceasing battles against the daelkyr and the other aberrations of the underworld.": "巨人陨落后形成了三种不同的鸦人文化。数量最多的是武库里（Vulkoori），他们是献给一个叫武库里的蝎子神的猎人。他们在自己的土地上猎杀巨人和其他危险品。在强大的德鲁伊和巫师的领导下，苏拉塔人坚持着可追溯到巨人时代的元素塑造传统。他们生活在整个Xen'drik的少数几个黑曜石城市中，并相信他们注定要在一场火热的天启中净化世界。最后，乌姆拉根（Umbragen）是在巨人文明衰落时逃入地球深处的乌鸦的后代。他们在与达尔凯尔（daelkyr）和其他地下世界的反常者进行的不间断战斗中挥舞着复杂的魔法。",
	"When creating a drow character, think about how you came to Khorvaire. Are you a Vulkoori hunter who accompanied an expedition home to Khorvaire, now seeking your way in this strange new world? Are you an Umbragen seeking powers that can help your people in their endless war? Or are you a Sulatar pursuing a personal path to glory?": "当创建一个乌鸦角色时，想想你是如何来到Khorvaire的。你是一个随同远征队回到Khorvaire的Vulkoori猎人，现在在这个陌生的新世界中寻找自己的道路？你是一个在无尽的战争中寻求能够帮助你的人民的力量的Umbragen人吗？或者你是一个追求个人荣耀之路的苏拉塔人？",
	"How do you react to meeting members of other elven cultures during your journeys? You might quickly recognize that most bear little resemblance to the terrors described in your people's legends, or you might have an almost instinctive reaction of distrust. You might have overcome your initial prejudices by the time the campaign begins, or perhaps you're working to build trust with another elf member of your adventuring party.": "在你的旅途中遇到其他精灵文化的成员，你会有什么反应？你可能很快就认识到大多数人与你的民族传说中描述的恐怖没有什么相似之处，或者你可能有一种几乎本能的不信任反应。在活动开始时，你可能已经克服了你最初的偏见，或者你正在努力与你的冒险队伍中的另一个精灵成员建立信任。",
	"The Mark of Shadow first appeared among the elves of the Phiarlan line, and the house quickly turned the mark's powers of shadow and illusion into an economic dynasty. The suspicion of their kin drove them from Aerenal to Khorvaire, and the house splintered during the Last War, giving rise to House Thuranni. The two houses of shadow control the business of espionage throughout Khorvaire, but they also operate more legitimate ventures related to art and entertainment.": "阴影印记首次出现在皮亚伦系的精灵中，该家族很快将印记的阴影和幻觉的力量转化为一个经济王朝。对他们亲属的怀疑将他们从艾瑞纳赶到了霍尔韦尔，在最后的战争中，这个家族分裂了，产生了瑟兰尼家族。这两个影子家族控制着整个霍尔韦尔的间谍业务，但他们也经营着与艺术和娱乐有关的更合法的企业。",
	"Phiarlan blood still runs among some of the Aereni elves, and the Mark of Shadow appears once or twice in each elven generation. Elves bearing this mark are always inducted into the elite force of the Cairdal Blades—an espionage agency in the service of Aerenal's Sibling Kings (see {@book chapter 2|ERLW|6|Aerenal}).": "皮亚伦的血统仍然流淌在一些Aereni精灵中，影子的印记在每一代精灵中出现一到两次。带着这个印记的精灵总是被纳入凯尔达尔之刃的精英部队--一个为Aerenal的兄弟姐妹国王服务的间谍机构（见（%0%））。",
	"Five words can defeat a thousand swords.": "五个字可以打败一千把剑。",
	"The average gnome has a love of knowledge that borders on obsession, a curiosity that admits no limits, and a vast collection of potentially useful information on every personal acquaintance. Most gnomes detest physical violence and prefer to solve their problems with words—whether that's a bard's eloquent persuasion, a wizard's words of power, or a rogue's careful threat. They give an initial impression as friendly busybodies, always ready to lend a hand or share a story, while asking questions that tend toward the slightly-too-personal. Often, though, a cheerful and amiable gnome is methodically adding to a mental storehouse of knowledge that might one day provide important leverage.": "普通地精对知识的热爱近乎痴迷，好奇心不受限制，并在每个人的熟人身上收集了大量潜在的有用信息。大多数地精厌恶肉体暴力，更喜欢用语言解决问题--无论是吟游诗人的雄辩说服，还是巫师的力量之语，或是流氓的谨慎威胁。他们给人的最初印象是友好的大忙人，总是准备伸出援手或分享故事，同时问一些倾向于稍微私人化的问题。不过，通常情况下，一个开朗和友好的地精正在有条不紊地增加一个知识的精神仓库，有一天可能会提供重要的筹码。",
	"To say that every Zil gnome is a ruthless schemer would be a hurtful exaggeration. Intrigue is the favorite pastime of most Zil, though. Every gnome child of Zilargo is taught to manipulate and deceive, and by the time they reach adulthood most have been involved in dozens of schemes and feuds, some of which persist well into adulthood. Even a gnome with a good heart and noble goals—of which there are many—often still prefers to use trickery and cunning rather than the unreliable tools of honesty or brute force.": "如果说每个Zil地精都是一个无情的阴谋家，那将是一种伤害性的夸大。不过，阴谋诡计是大多数齐尔人最喜欢的消遣方式。每一个Zilargo的地精孩子都被教导如何操纵和欺骗，当他们成年时，大多数人已经参与了几十个计划和争斗，其中一些一直持续到成年。即使是心地善良、目标高尚的地精--这类人很多--往往还是喜欢使用诡计和狡猾，而不是诚实或蛮力这些不可靠的工具。",
	"Most Zil gnomes belong to the forest gnome subrace. Their natural talent for illusion aids them in trickery and entertaining, and they often use small animals as messengers and guides.": "大多数齐尔侏儒属于森林侏儒亚种。他们在幻觉方面的天赋帮助他们进行欺骗和娱乐，他们经常使用小动物作为信使和向导。",

Or you could be a sage gathering information for the Library of Korranberg or an investigator sending stories of your adventures back to the {@i Korranberg Chronicle}. Family is important to the Zil, and you could be pursuing your family's interests. You could even be working for the mysterious Trust, the conspiracy behind the Triumvirate's throne that quietly maintains order in Zilargo. If you are working for the Trust, you could have a specific mission, but you could also be a sleeper agent—gathering information and allies until you're activated and you are put to your intended use.": "此外，考虑你与Zilargo的关系：你为什么离开，以及你与它还有什么联系？你的计划可以为你的离开提供一个很好的理由。或者你可以是一个为科兰伯格图书馆收集信息的圣人，或者是一个将你的冒险故事送回（%0%）的调查员。家庭对齐尔人很重要，你可以追求你家庭的利益。你甚至可以为神秘的托拉斯工作，这是三巨头王位背后的阴谋，悄悄地维持着齐乐国的秩序。如果你为信托会工作，你可能有一个特定的任务，但你也可能是一个潜伏的特工--收集信息和盟友，直到你被激活，你被投入你的预期用途。",
	"Zil society is divided into major houses, each of which is composed of multiple families. Each gnome carries the name of a house and of a family in addition to a personal name. For example, Alina Lorridan Lyrris and Tallian Talius Lyrris are members of different families (Lorridan and Talius) within House Lyrris. Gnome names are long and lyrical; a Zil proverb claims \"the sweetest song is the name of a friend.\" Personal and clan names are usually at least three syllables long, and there is a strong tradition of alliteration.": "Zil社会被划分为主要的家族，每个家族都由多个家庭组成。每个地精除了个人的名字外，还带有一个家族的名字和一个家庭的名字。例如，阿琳娜-洛里丹-莱里斯和塔利安-塔利厄斯-莱里斯是莱里斯家族中不同家族（洛里丹和塔利厄斯）的成员。地精的名字很长，也很抒情；Zil的一句谚语称 \"最甜美的歌是朋友的名字\"。个人和氏族的名字通常至少有三个音节，而且有强烈的典故传统。",
	"As they have for countless generations, insatiable curiosity and endless opportunity draw gnomes from Zilargo into the wider lands of Khorvaire. Most of these dispersed gnomes find new homes and integrate easily into local cultures. Gnomes can be found in any walk of life, whether they be as merchants, magewrights, scholars, or scoundrels. While the gnomes of the Five Nations aren't as inherently devious as their Zil cousins, they share the Zil emphasis on the importance of family.": "正如他们无数代以来所做的那样，永不满足的好奇心和无穷无尽的机会将地精从Zilargo吸引到更广阔的Khorvaire土地。这些分散的地精大多找到了新的家园，并轻易地融入了当地文化。地精可以在任何生活领域被发现，无论是商人、魔法师、学者还是恶棍。虽然五国的地精并不像他们的齐尔表亲那样天生就很狡猾，但他们与齐尔一样强调家庭的重要性。",
	"As a gnome character from the Five Nations, you might have a network of connections to the community your grew up in, likely built on the exchange of information. Alternatively, you might seek your own path in life, avoiding the intrigues your cousins adore.": "作为一个来自五国的地精角色，你可能有一个与你长大的社区的联系网络，可能是建立在信息交流的基础上。或者，你可能会在生活中寻求自己的道路，避开你的表亲们所崇拜的阴谋。",
	"The Mark of Scribing appears among the gnomes of House Sivis. The gnomes of this house were among the first of their kind to leave Zilargo and live in human lands. They love bureaucracy and intrigue as much as the gnomes of their homeland, but they have carefully cultivated a reputation for impartiality and secrecy, since their services rely on trust.": "划线的标记出现在西维斯家族的地精中。这个家族的地精是最早离开兹拉尔戈并生活在人类土地上的同类之一。他们和故乡的地精一样喜欢官僚主义和阴谋诡计，但他们精心培养了公正和保密的声誉，因为他们的服务依赖于信任。",

Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.": "妖精物种--妖精、地精和虫熊--曾经是霍尔韦尔的主导文明，妖精帝国达卡安统治了这片大陆数千年之久。它被与达尔凯尔（daelkyr）及其反常军队的长期冲突所削弱；尽管达尔凯尔被打败了，但疯狂的种子在帝国中生根发芽并将其撕裂。今天，在霍尔韦尔有四种主要的地精文化。",
	"Goblins dwell in most of the major cities of the Five Nations. When humans first came to Khorvaire, they enslaved many goblins and built their cities on the foundations of Dhakaani ruins.

	"The Ghaal'dar tribes arose from the remnants of the Dhakaani Empire. Hobgoblins are the leaders of the Ghaal'dar, enforcing their will on their goblin and bugbear peers. The history of the Ghaal'dar is filled with strife; when they weren't fighting Galifar or Zilargo, the tribes usually turned on one another. This came to an end with the Last War. House Deneith hired Ghaal'dar mercenaries, and this gave focus to the divided tribes. A brilliant hobgoblin, Haruuc, united the Ghaal'dar, and under his leadership they seized control of what is now Darguun (see {@book chapter 2|ERLW|5}). The aging Lhesh Haruuc remains as the ruler of Darguun, and many fear that his death could throw the region into chaos.": "Ghaal'dar部落是从达卡尼帝国的残余中产生的。霍布林是Ghaal'dar的领袖，将他们的意志强加给他们的地精和虫族同胞。Ghaal'dar的历史充满了纷争；当他们不与加利法尔或齐拉尔戈作战时，各部落通常会相互攻伐。这在最后一次战争中结束了。迪尼斯家族雇佣了盖尔达尔的雇佣兵，这让分裂的部落有了焦点。一个聪明的妖精，哈鲁克，团结了Ghaal'dar，在他的领导下，他们夺取了对现在的Darguun的控制权（见（%0%））。年迈的莱什-哈鲁克仍然是达尔昆的统治者，许多人担心他的死亡会使该地区陷入混乱。",

	"The Marguul bugbears threw off the yoke of the Ghaal'dar long ago, seizing territory in the Seawall Mountains in the south of Darguun.

	"As a Marguul bugbear, you are savage and proud of it. The Marguul worship the Mockery and believe in victory by any means necessary: there is no such thing as honor on the battlefield. It's certainly an unusual choice for a player character, but if you've taken a liking to a particular group of the small folk, you could be a powerful ally.": "作为玛古尔虫族，你是野蛮的，并以此为荣。马古尔人崇拜嘲讽，相信不择手段的胜利：在战场上没有所谓的荣誉。对于一个玩家角色来说，这当然是一个不寻常的选择，但如果你对某一特定的小民群体有好感，你就可以成为一个强大的盟友。",
	"Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds of corruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.": "虽然达卡尼帝国打败了外星的达尔基尔，但战争留下了腐败的种子，散落在整个帝国。当达卡尼开始衰落时，一些将军和总督聚集了他们的力量，并撤退到地球深处的庇护所，决心保护他们的文明，直到帝国最终能够恢复。几千年后，他们的后裔终于出现了，他们相互竞争，以确定哪位领导人值得拥有帝国的王冠。一旦解决了这个问题，他们将转向征服达尔古恩和霍尔韦尔。",
	"The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the Ghaal'dar; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent.

Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the {@i khesh'dar} (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers.

	"The halflings of Eberron originate from eastern Khorvaire, and many nomadic tribes of halflings still travel the Talenta Plains. The appearance of dragonmarks among the halflings spurred their slow migration across Khorvaire, spreading their services of healing and hospitality along with the migration of the earliest humans across the continent. Now they are found in every part of Khorvaire, putting their distinctive talents to use.": "Eberron的半身人起源于Khorvaire东部，许多半身人的游牧部落仍然在Talenta平原旅行。龙纹在半身人中的出现刺激了他们在Khorvaire的缓慢迁移，随着最早的人类在大陆上的迁移，他们的治疗和款待服务也随之传播开来。现在，他们被发现在Khorvaire的每一个地方，把他们独特的才能用在这里。",

	"The halflings who migrated across Khorvaire in the company of humans ended up looking very human in dress, manners, and customs. Their cousins who remain in the Talenta Plains could hardly appear more different. In their homeland, halflings are nomads who ride domesticated dinosaurs across the wide plains.

	"As you make a Talenta halfling character, give some thought to why your character left the open plains. Perhaps you served as a mercenary scout in the Last War, and you've remained with the comrades you met in the conflict. Maybe your tribe was wiped out by a foreign enemy, spurring you to travel the wider world in search of information and revenge. You might be guided by the spirits, who send you whispers and visions that lead you on your adventures. You could be an official envoy of your tribe seeking allies in the world, or simply sent to learn more about the lands beyond the plains.": "当你制作一个塔伦塔半身人角色时，请考虑一下你的角色为什么要离开开阔的平原。也许你在最后一次战争中担任了雇佣兵侦察员，你一直和你在冲突中遇到的战友在一起。也许你的部落被外敌消灭了，刺激你到更广阔的世界去寻找信息和复仇。你可能受到神灵的指引，他们向你发出低语和幻觉，引导你进行冒险。你可能是你的部落的官方特使，在世界范围内寻找盟友，或者只是被派去了解平原以外的土地。",
	"Also, consider your relationship to the dinosaurs that play a central role in the life of the Talenta halflings. You might flavor your spells and class features as dinosaur-related: you could have a clawfoot companion, take on a fastieth form, name your combat styles and maneuvers after dinosaur attacks, or take inspiration from a glidewing (pteranodon) totem spirit. Or you could simply wear a dinosaur mask (as many Talenta halflings do), adorn yourself with claws and teeth from past dinosaur companions, or adopt dinosaur-like mannerisms. Wherever you travel, your connection to the dinosaurs of your home remains strong.": "另外，考虑你与恐龙的关系，恐龙在塔伦塔半身人的生活中起着核心作用。你可以将你的法术和等级特征描绘成与恐龙有关：你可以有一个爪足同伴，拥有一个快活的形态，以恐龙的攻击方式命名你的战斗方式和动作，或者从滑翔翼（翼龙）图腾精神中获得灵感。或者你可以简单地戴上恐龙面具（就像许多塔伦塔半身人所做的那样），用过去的恐龙伙伴的爪子和牙齿来装饰自己，或者采取类似恐龙的举止。无论你在哪里旅行，你与你家乡的恐龙的联系仍然很紧密。",

Of course, these same talents prove equally useful for burglars, grifters, and other criminals.": "敏捷而迷人，许多半身人把他们的天赋作为吟游诗人、大律师、商人和政治家在整个Khorvaire使用。当然，这些天赋对小偷、骗子和其他罪犯也同样有用。",
	"Of particular note is the halfling-run criminal enterprise of the Boromar Clan, the most powerful crime syndicate in Breland. The Boromars are based in Sharn, but their influence reaches across the nation and even to the distant city of Stormreach. If you decide to play a halfling rogue, or a character with a criminal or charlatan background, consider (with your DM) whether you have a connection to the Boromar Clan. You could be a freelance operative who occasionally gets jobs from a Boromar underboss. You might have a cousin in the syndicate, who occasionally pulls you in to criminal affairs. Or you could even be the reluctant heir of a Boromar leader; perhaps you've gone on the run rather than take your appointed place in the criminal empire, but your past may yet catch up with you. You could also be the point of contact who has made the Boromar Clan your party's group patron, as described later in this chapter.": "特别值得注意的是半身人经营的犯罪企业波洛玛家族，这是布雷兰最强大的犯罪集团。波罗玛家族的总部设在沙恩，但他们的影响力遍及全国，甚至延伸到遥远的风暴城。如果你决定扮演一个半身人流氓，或者一个有犯罪或江湖背景的角色，请考虑（与你的管理员一起）你是否与波洛玛尔家族有联系。你可以是一个自由职业者，偶尔会从波洛马族的老板那里得到工作。你可能有一个表弟在集团里，他偶尔会把你拉到犯罪事务中去。或者你甚至可能是一个Boromar领袖的不情愿的继承人；也许你已经逃跑了，而不是在犯罪帝国中占据你指定的位置，但你的过去可能还会追上你。你也可以是让波洛马氏族成为你的团体赞助人的联络人，如本章后面所述。",
	"Two dragonmarks appear among the halflings of Khorvaire, the Mark of Healing in House Jorasco and House Ghallanda's Mark of Hospitality. Both marks are ancient, first manifesting among the halflings about the same time that the elves of Aerenal received their first marks—centuries before the arrival of humans on Khorvaire. Sometimes halflings of House Ghallanda joke that their mark prepared them for the arrival of humans by allowing them to make their new guests comfortable in Khorvaire. There's actually some truth in the humor: the services provided by both halfling houses helped enable the spread of humanity across the continent.": "有两个龙纹出现在霍尔韦尔的半身人中，即乔拉斯科家族的治愈之纹和加兰达家族的好客之纹。这两种龙纹都很古老，第一次出现在半身人中的时间与艾瑞纳尔的精灵获得他们的第一个龙纹的时间差不多--在人类到达科尔瓦尔的几个世纪之前。有时加兰达家族的半身人开玩笑说，他们的印记让他们为人类的到来做好了准备，让他们的新客人在科尔韦尔感到舒适。幽默中其实也有一些道理：两个半身人家族提供的服务都有助于人类在大陆上的传播。",
	"With its powers related to food and shelter, the Mark of Hospitality was a boon to the early halfling nomads, but now it allows House Ghallanda to run the best inns, hostels, and taverns in the land. Similarly, the Mark of Healing has always been a boon to both nomads and settlers facing dangerous wilds, and House Jorasco still employs both magical and mundane healing techniques to tend to the well-being of patients across Khorvaire.": "凭借其与食物和住所有关的力量，好客的标志对早期的半身人游牧者来说是一个福音，但现在它使加兰达家族能够经营这片土地上最好的旅店、旅馆和酒馆。同样地，治疗的标记一直是游牧民族和定居者面对危险的荒野时的福音，乔拉斯科家族仍然采用魔法和世俗的治疗技术来照顾整个霍尔韦尔的病人的福祉。",
	"Dwarves are stoic. Elves are wise. Gnomes are cunning. And humans? They can't make up their mind, so they try to be all of these things at once.": "矮人是坚毅的。精灵是聪明的。侏儒是狡猾的。而人类呢？他们无法决定自己的想法，所以他们试图同时成为所有这些东西。",
	"The first human settlers came to Khorvaire about 3,000 years ago, landing in the area now known as the Lhazaar Principalities. From there, they began a slow but inexorable spread across the continent, disrupting the placid elven empire of Aerenal and leaving further ruined remnants of fallen Dhakaani goblin kingdoms in their wake. During this migration, they founded the settlements that would grow into the Five Nations. Even today humans make up the majority of the population in these countries. Despite their relatively short lifespans—or perhaps because of them—humans are innovative, adaptable, and aggressive, always pushing their limits and pursuing new ideas.": "第一批人类定居者大约在3000年前来到了Khorvaire，在现在被称为Lhazaar公国的地区登陆。从那里，他们开始缓慢但不可阻挡地蔓延到整个大陆，扰乱了平静的精灵帝国Aerenal，并在他们之后留下了更多堕落的达卡尼地精王国的废墟残骸。在这次迁徙中，他们建立了一些定居点，这些定居点后来发展成为五国。即使在今天，人类也占了这些国家人口的大多数。尽管他们的寿命相对较短，或者也许是因为他们的寿命，人类具有创新性、适应性和侵略性，总是在挑战自己的极限和追求新的想法。",
	"Humans prove extremely diverse; a barbarian from the Demon Wastes has little in common with a Brelish rogue.

The goblin empire scattered the orc tribes and forced them into harsh and unwanted lands: the swamps of the Shadow Marches, the Demon Wastes, and the depths of the Ironroot Mountains. But in the Shadow Marches, the orcs learned the secrets of druidic magic from the dragon Vvaraak, becoming the first of the Gatekeepers. With the invasion of the alien daelkyr from Xoriat, the Gatekeepers put the dragon's teaching to the test, creating magical seals that bound the daelkyr in the depths of Khyber and protected Eberron against further incursion from the plane of madness.": "在人类来到霍尔韦尔的几千年前，这片土地被达卡尼帝国的野生兽人和地精统治着。妖精帝国将兽人部落分散开来，迫使他们进入严酷而不受欢迎的土地：阴影沼泽、恶魔荒原和铁根山脉的深处。但在阴影地带，兽人从龙Vvaraak那里学到了德鲁伊魔法的秘密，成为第一批守门人。随着外来的达尔凯尔（daelkyr）从索里亚特入侵，守门人将龙的教导付诸实践，创造了神奇的封印，将达尔凯尔束缚在开伯尔的深处，保护埃伯龙免受来自疯狂世界的进一步入侵。",

However, many orcs succumbed to that same corruption and embraced the madness of the cults of the Dragon Below. Orcs who follow both of these paths continue to live in the Shadow Marches, and centuries of battles between them have diminished both sides.": "兽人守门员在击败达尔凯尔并将其邪恶束缚在开伯尔的过程中发挥了至关重要的作用，他们的后代继续维护着古老的封印，并与达尔凯尔的腐败所产生的异常现象作斗争。然而，许多兽人也屈服于这种堕落，接受了龙下之神的疯狂崇拜。遵循这两条道路的兽人继续生活在阴影地带，他们之间几个世纪的争斗使双方的力量都有所减弱。",

	"Patrons are more than a resource for your group to draw on, they are also a responsibility. Some patrons might be eager to support your group, while others might prove more demanding.": "赞助人不仅仅是你的团体可以利用的资源，他们也是一种责任。一些赞助人可能渴望支持你的团体，而另一些则可能要求更多。",
	"Your group's patron might occasionally come to you and give you an assignment. This can be an easy way to get into an adventure. Of course, it's up to you how you respond to your patron's demands, and interesting stories can emerge if you decide to refuse an assignment.": "你们小组的赞助人可能偶尔会来找你，给你一个任务。这可能是进入冒险的一个简单方法。当然，这取决于你如何回应你的赞助人的要求，如果你决定拒绝任务，就会出现有趣的故事。",
	"Even a patron that isn't heavy-handed can significantly motivate your group. Maybe you'll seek adventures based on what pleases your patron and so earn a reward. A university, for example, might not send you on a particular mission, but you might decide to follow leads to an ancient artifact hoping the university might reward you for bringing it back. You have the freedom to chart your own destiny, while still letting the patron shape the nature of your group and the adventures you undertake.": "即使是一个并不严厉的赞助人也能极大地激励你的团体。也许你会根据你的赞助人的喜好来寻求冒险，从而获得奖励。例如，一所大学可能不会派你去做某个特定的任务，但你可能会决定跟踪一个古代文物的线索，希望大学能奖励你把它带回来。你可以自由地规划自己的命运，同时还可以让赞助人决定你的团体的性质和你所进行的冒险。",
	"It might help to think of the patrons in this section in terms of three broad categories of autonomy:": "从三大类自主权的角度来考虑本节中的赞助人可能会有所帮助。",
	"With a {@b highly directive} patron, you are an employee of an organization, and the organization often tells you what to do. Crime syndicates, dragonmarked houses, espionage agencies, military forces, and newspapers are typically highly directive.": "有了{@b highly directive}赞助人，你就是一个组织的雇员，而这个组织往往会告诉你该怎么做。犯罪集团、龙纹屋、间谍机构、军队和报纸通常都是高度指令性的。",
	"With a {@b highly autonomous} patron, you are more like a freelancer. Your patron might offer you assignments or reward you for achieving certain objectives, but it doesn't dictate your activities. Adventurers' guilds, heads of state, immortal beings, inquisitive agencies, religious orders, and universities are typically highly autonomous.": "有了{@b highly autonomous}赞助人，你就更像一个自由职业者。你的赞助人可能会给你提供任务，或者奖励你实现某些目标，但它不会支配你的活动。冒险家协会、国家元首、不朽的生命、探究机构、宗教团体和大学通常都是高度自治的。",
	"In a {@b player-directed} organization, you don't have a patron because your adventuring party is in charge. You're the boss; you tell others what to do, and you're responsible to no one for your own activities. A criminal syndicate, inquisitive agency, military force, or newspaper can be a player-directed organization.": "在一个{@b player-directed}的组织中，你没有赞助人，因为你的冒险党是负责任的。你是老板；你告诉别人该怎么做，而你对自己的活动不对任何人负责。一个犯罪集团、调查机构、军事力量或报纸都可以是一个由玩家指导的组织。",
	"Every group patron offers your party a number of benefits for your service. These benefits range from standard business arrangements, like a salary and access to staff facilities, to more extraordinary boons, like audiences with powerful figures or exceptions from certain laws. Specific benefits are presented in more detail in the benefits section of each group patron.": "每个团体赞助人都会为你们的服务提供一些好处。这些好处包括标准的商业安排，如工资和使用工作人员的设施，以及更多特殊的好处，如与有权势的人物会面或某些法律的例外。具体的好处在每个团体赞助人的好处部分有更详细的介绍。",
	"Beyond the benefits described in each group patron's description, patrons can also grant additional favors. If your party is in good standing with your patron—proving yourselves reliable agents who fulfill the group's goals—your patron might grant requests for additional favors. A favor might take a variety of forms appropriate to the patron's area of influence or expertise, such as small loans, specialized equipment, or access to people and places you wouldn't otherwise have. Patrons who you regularly find yourself in conflict with aren't likely to grant you favors, unless doing so directly furthers their goals.": "除了每个团体赞助人描述的好处外，赞助人还可以给予额外的好处。如果你的党派与你的赞助人有良好的关系--证明你们是可靠的代理人，能实现团体的目标--你的赞助人可能会批准额外的好处请求。恩惠可以采取各种形式，适合赞助人的影响力或专业知识，如小额贷款、专门设备，或接触你无法接触的人和地方。那些经常与你发生冲突的赞助人不可能给你好处，除非这样做能直接促进他们的目标。",
	"In any case, the DM shouldn't feel limited to providing only the benefits noted in each group patron's description. Patrons give a party access to solutions and support they wouldn't have otherwise, and a patron might use their varied resources to guide their agents or prepare them for greater adventures.": "在任何情况下，DM都不应该觉得只提供每个团体赞助人描述中提到的好处是有限的。赞助人可以让一方获得他们无法获得的解决方案和支持，而且赞助人可能会利用他们的各种资源来指导他们的代理人，或者为他们准备更大的冒险。",
	"For certain kinds of organizations, you can either join an existing group or found your own. For some players, the idea of running a crime syndicate, inquisitive agency, mercenary company, or newspaper is much more exciting than working for someone else. Founding your own organization offers a greater degree of autonomy, though potentially at the cost of support and reliable work.": "对于某些类型的组织，你可以加入一个现有的团体，也可以建立自己的组织。对于一些玩家来说，经营一个犯罪集团、调查机构、雇佣兵公司或报纸的想法要比为别人工作更令人兴奋。创立自己的组织提供了更大程度的自主权，尽管有可能以获得支持和可靠的工作为代价。",
	"The information in this section applies whether you join an organization or found your own. When you're the boss, some of the benefits of belonging to an organization become expenses you have to worry about; when you run your own mercenary company, for example, you need to stock your own armory rather than drawing on an existing organization's stockpile. The organization brings in income, but you'll have to spend some of it to keep the organization running.": "无论你是加入一个组织还是建立自己的组织，本节中的信息都适用。当你是老板时，属于一个组织的一些好处变成了你必须担心的开支；例如，当你经营自己的雇佣兵公司时，你需要储备自己的军械库，而不是从现有组织的库存中获取。组织带来了收入，但你必须花费其中的一部分来维持组织的运行。",
	"When you run your own organization, you can use the Running a Business downtime activity (see {@book chapter 6|DMG|6} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}) to reflect your organization's ongoing activities. More than one character can take part in this activity at a time. When rolling to determine the business's performance, add the total days spent by all the characters to the roll to determine the business's success (still observing the maximum of 30). If the business earns a profit, multiply that profit by 4 + the number of characters who took part in this downtime activity.": "当你经营自己的组织时，你可以使用经营企业的停工活动（见{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}的{@book chapter 6|DMG|6}）来反映你的组织的持续活动。一次可以有一个以上的角色参加这个活动。当滚动确定企业的业绩时，将所有角色花费的总天数加入到滚动中，以确定企业的成功（仍然遵守30的上限）。如果该企业获得了利润，则将该利润乘以4+参加该停工活动的人物数量。",

	"Your group has ties to a network of professional adventurers. These experts share contacts, resources, and leads on all manner of unusual and often dangerous work.

They might point you to adventures halfway across the world, but the general assumption is that you'll always come home to your guildhall, sooner or later.": "除了少数例外，冒险者公会的范围都是本地的，因为他们的主要利益集中在公会大厅。他们可能会指点你去世界各地的冒险，但一般的假设是，你总是会回到你的公会，迟早的事。",
	"Sharn's Clifftop neighborhood, located in the upper part of the Dura district, has long served as a crossroads for adventurers and soldiers of fortune. A dwarf named Shekkal Korranor established the Clifftop Adventurers' Guild 150 years ago, intending it as a place where explorers and wanderers could find support and good company. Shekkal died in the Last War, but the guild remains—a social club for adventurers and a one-stop marketplace for anyone seeking capable champions.": "沙恩的悬崖顶街区，位于杜拉区的上部，长期以来一直是冒险家和财富战士的十字路口。150年前，一个名叫Shekkal Korranor的矮人建立了悬崖顶冒险者公会，打算将其作为探险者和流浪者可以找到支持和好伙伴的地方。Shekkal在最后一次战争中死去，但公会仍然存在--一个冒险家的社交俱乐部，一个为寻求有能力的冠军的人提供的一站式市场。",

The neighborhood around it caters to adventurers' other needs with its variety of shops and services.": "悬崖顶冒险者协会总部是其所在地区的物质和社会中心，是一座巨大的石头建筑，是用一生的冒险经历获得的财富建造的。部分是安静的图书馆，部分是舒适的旅馆，部分是活跃的体育馆，部分是喧闹的酒馆，公会总部几乎包含了冒险者训练、学习和社交所需的所有设施。它周围的街区以各种商店和服务来满足冒险者的其他需求。",
	"Most of the members of the Clifftop Adventurers' Guild have a modest amount of experience as successful adventurers.

	"Relationships with most of the guild's allies are based on business and built on upstanding reputations. Ultimately, though, the guild is a loose affiliation of groups, and organizations that have a good relationship with one of those groups might not transfer their good will to another. The following groups do brisk business with members of the Clifftop Adventurers' Guild:": "与公会大多数盟友的关系都是基于业务，建立在良好的声誉上。不过，归根结底，公会是一个松散的团体联盟，与其中一个团体有良好关系的组织可能不会把他们的善意转移到另一个团体。以下团体与悬崖顶冒险者协会的成员做着活跃的生意。",
	"Watch Commander Lian Halamar, in charge of the large and prestigious Daggerwatch Garrison in Sharn's Dura quarter, has long been suspected of ties to the infamous Boromar Clan. Though these suspicions are often dismissed as simple prejudice in the assumption that any halfling in Sharn must be associated with the crime syndicate, the Voice of Breland, in cooperation with civic-minded members of the Clifftop Adventurers' Guid, have uncovered stunning evidence confirming this connection. The Clifftop guild denies claims that these accusations embody the latest fracas in the long-running tensions between the Daggerwatch Garrison and the city's various groups of heroes for hire.": "负责沙恩杜拉区庞大而著名的匕首守卫部队的守卫指挥官廉-哈拉马，长期以来一直被怀疑与臭名昭著的波罗马家族有关系。尽管这些怀疑常常被认为是简单的偏见，认为沙恩的任何半身人都必须与犯罪集团有关，但布雷兰之声与具有公民意识的克利夫托普冒险者协会成员合作，发现了证实这种联系的惊人证据。崖顶公会否认了这些指控体现了匕首守卫队和城市的各种雇佣英雄团体之间长期以来的紧张关系中的最新争吵。",
	"{@b Affiliated guilds}.

	"{@b Clifftop businesses}. The guild is a prominent feature in its neighborhood, and much of the area is dedicated to meeting guild's needs.

	"{@b House Tharashk}. The Tharashk enclave in Clifftop provides the services of guides with extensive experience exploring Xend'rik, and it is careful to retain only guides who receive positive referrals from guild members. House Tharashk also uses the guild as a means to hire adventurers to serve as bodyguards on their own prospecting expeditions.": "{@b House Tharashk}. 位于Clifftop的Tharashk飞地提供具有丰富探索Xend'rik经验的向导服务，并且它很谨慎地只保留那些得到公会成员积极推荐的向导。萨拉什克家族还利用公会作为手段，雇佣冒险者作为他们自己勘探探险的保镖。",

	"{@b Sharn Watch}. Clifftop is protected of the Daggerwatch Garrison and Watch Commander Lian Halamar. Halamar has no love for adventurers and is happy to catch guild members on the wrong side of the law.": "{@b Sharn Watch}. 悬崖顶受到匕首守卫军和守卫指挥官Lian Halamar的保护。哈拉玛对冒险者没有好感，他很高兴能抓到犯法的公会成员。",
	"As members of an adventurers' guild, your group gains the following benefits:": "作为冒险家协会的成员，你的团体可以获得以下好处。",

	"{@b Storage}. The guild will store items for its members. The Clifftop guild has an account with House Kundarak banks that allow its members to store valuables in secure vaults. Some guilds have access to items such as a {@item bag of holding} or a safe that opens into a similar extradimensional space. In the worst case, an item can be hidden in a guildhall's basement for a time.": "{@b Storage}. 该公会将为其成员储存物品。崖顶公会在昆达拉克家族银行有一个账户，允许其成员在安全的金库中储存贵重物品。一些行会可以获得诸如{@item bag of holding}或打开到类似次元空间的保险箱的物品。在最坏的情况下，一件物品可以在公会的地下室里隐藏一段时间。",

	"Typically, an adventuring group has no particular contact within the larger guild.

The Guild Contact table provides inspiration for contacts you might encounter during any given encounter with your adventurer's guild.": "通常情况下，一个冒险团在大的行会中没有特别的联系。有一个当地的领导或簿记员负责收取会费，但除此之外，你可能会在不同的情况下与公会的不同成员打交道--在寻找合同、收集推荐人、住在公会大厅等等。公会联系人表提供了你在与冒险者公会的任何特定接触中可能遇到的联系人的灵感。",

Named for the lower-class district in Sharn where it maintains its guildhall, the Deathsgate Explorers' Club is a rough-and-tumble guild made up largely of Last War veterans.

Founded by a renowned hunter and explorer, Lord Boroman ir'Dayne, the Wayfinder Foundation is an exclusive adventurers' guild that welcomes only experienced and renowned members. Dayne suffers from a wasting curse that prevents him from undertaking further adventures of his own, so he has put his considerable fortune to use in sponsoring great expeditions.

	"Your group is a team of crooks that's part of an organized crime syndicate. You're more talented and have a wider range of skills than most thugs and burglars, so your crew might be entrusted with more important tasks than simply roughing up local merchants or breaking into empty apartments.

	"Crime syndicates thrived during the Last War. The war left many people desperate, driving them into lives of crime. The war also demanded huge numbers of able-bodied soldiers, which reduced the ranks of law enforcement across Khorvaire. As a result, most settlements have some organized criminal element, ranging from small local thieves' guilds to international organizations with dozens of interconnected branches.": "犯罪集团在最后一次战争期间蓬勃发展。战争使许多人感到绝望，促使他们走上犯罪的道路。战争还需要大量的精壮的士兵，这使得整个霍尔韦尔的执法队伍减少。因此，大多数定居点都有一些有组织的犯罪因素，从小型的地方盗贼行会到拥有几十个相互联系的分支机构的国际组织。",

They have a stranglehold on the smuggling trade and own the majority of the gambling halls in the city, while most of the fences and thieves in Sharn either work directly for the them or pay tribute in exchange for independence. The Boromars control a vast network of extortion, blackmail, and graft that extends throughout the city, and their influence reaches far beyond the criminal underworld. The early Boromar patriarchs invested wisely over the centuries, and today the Boromars are one of the Sixty, the elite tier of Sharn's aristocracy. The Boromar Clan owns warehouses, taverns, and inns throughout the city, and it has a considerable interest in the shipping trade. A Boromar heir sits on the city council of Sharn, and the current head of the clan is a member of the Gold Concord of the Aurum (described in {@book chapter 4|ERLW|11|The Boromar Clan}).": "波罗玛家族是沙恩市最强大的犯罪组织。从最初的走私犯和盗贼团伙，波洛玛家族已经崛起，成为城市中最有影响力的势力之一。他们垄断了走私贸易，并拥有城市中大部分的赌博厅，而沙恩的大多数栅栏和盗贼要么直接为他们工作，要么支付贡品以换取独立。波罗玛人控制着一个庞大的敲诈、勒索和嫁接网络，延伸到整个城市，他们的影响力远远超出了黑社会的范畴。几个世纪以来，早期的博罗玛族长进行了明智的投资，如今博罗玛族是沙恩贵族中的精英阶层--60人之一。波罗玛家族在整个城市拥有仓库、酒馆和旅店，并在航运贸易中拥有相当大的利益。波洛马的继承人是沙恩市议会的成员，该家族的现任族长是奥鲁姆黄金协约的成员（详见（%0%））。",
	"As much as some members of the Sharn Council and the Watch would like to see the Boromars disbanded, the syndicate is unlikely to collapse any time soon.": "尽管沙恩委员会和守望先锋的一些成员很想看到博罗玛人被解散，但这个集团不太可能很快就会崩溃。",
	"The core membership of the Boromar Clan—comprising about one in six of its members—is an extended family of halflings descended from immigrants who came to Sharn from the Talenta Plains. Another third of the members are unrelated halflings, and the rest belong to other species. The syndicate employs a wide variety of bookkeepers and administrators as well as burglars, con artists, smugglers, and other criminals. When a situation calls for physical violence, the Boromars usually hire freelancers—members of the Sharn Guard or agents of House Tarkanan. The Boromar family proper has a team of personal bodyguards called the Clawfoots, who are mostly fierce halfling warriors recently relocated from the Talenta Plains. They primarily defend Boromar holdings and headquarters in the halfling district of Little Plains.": "Boromar氏族的核心成员--约占其成员总数的六分之一--是一个半身人的大家庭，他们是来自塔伦塔平原的移民的后代。另外三分之一的成员是没有血缘关系的半身人，其余的属于其他物种。该集团雇佣了各种各样的簿记员和行政人员，以及窃贼、骗子、走私者和其他罪犯。当需要使用暴力的时候，波洛玛家族通常会雇佣自由职业者--沙恩卫队的成员或塔卡南家族的代理人。波罗玛家族有一队私人保镖，叫做 \"爪足\"，他们大多是最近从塔伦塔平原迁来的凶猛的半身人战士。他们主要保卫博罗玛的财产和位于小平原的半身人区的总部。",
	"The Boromar Clan has a reputation for omnipotence that makes even the forces of law and order in Sharn hesitant to cross it. It's far safer to be an ally of the syndicate, or at least to stay out of its way, than it is to be its enemy—and it's more lucrative to boot. The following groups count themselves among the Boromar Clan's closest allies:": "Boromar家族有一个无所不能的名声，甚至让沙恩的法律和秩序力量都对它犹豫不决。成为该集团的盟友，或者至少不受其影响，要比成为其敌人安全得多，而且更有利可图。以下团体是波罗马家族最亲密的盟友之一。",
	"{@b House Jorasco}. The head of the Boromar Clan, Saidan Boromar, is married to an unmarked heir of House Jorasco, Mala Boromar d'Jorasco. This marriage has created important ties between the Boromars and the halfling healers of Sharn. Members of the Boromar family can secure healing for free, and other members of the syndicate receive a 10 percent discount at Jorasco houses of healing.": "{@b House Jorasco}. 波罗玛家族的首领，赛丹-波罗玛，与乔拉斯科家族的一位无名继承人玛拉-波罗玛-德-乔拉斯科结婚。这场婚姻在博罗玛家族和沙恩的半身人治疗师之间建立了重要的联系。博罗玛家族的成员可以免费获得治疗，而集团的其他成员在乔拉斯科的治疗机构可以获得10%的折扣。",
	"{@b Sharn Council}. Of the seventeen members of Sharn's city council, four have close ties to the Boromar Clan—including one, Ilyra Boromar, who reports directly to the head of the syndicate. These four vote as a bloc to ensure that the council doesn't take direct action against the Boromars, while enough of the other council members fear the syndicate that they tend to carry the vote. A member of the Boromar Clan can call in a favor to secure an audience with one of these councilors, though such does not guarantee aid.": "{@b Sharn Council}. 在沙恩市议会的17名成员中，有4人与波洛玛家族关系密切--包括一个叫伊拉-波洛玛的人，他直接向集团的负责人汇报。这四个人作为一个集团投票，以确保议会不对波洛玛家族采取直接行动，而其他议会成员对集团有足够的恐惧，所以他们倾向于进行投票。波罗玛氏族的成员可以通过求助来确保与这些理事之一会面，但这并不能保证得到援助。",
	"{@b Sharn Watch}. The Boromars have been bribing captains of the Sharn Watch for generations. What's more, if the Boromar Clan collapsed, the underworld would erupt in anarchy as dozens of petty crime lords fought for territory and position. As a result, a member of the Boromars can call in a favor to get minor criminal charges dismissed.": "{@b Sharn Watch}. 波罗玛人世代都在贿赂沙恩观察站的队长。更重要的是，如果波洛玛尔家族垮台，黑社会将爆发无政府状态，因为几十个小犯罪头目为了争夺地盘和地位而大打出手。因此，波洛玛尔家族的成员可以叫人帮忙，使轻微的刑事指控被撤销。",
	"Despite the Boromar Clan's position of strength in Sharn, it has many foes, and their unrelenting assaults have put the syndicate in what might be its most precarious position ever. Currently, the following groups pose the greatest threats to Boromar interests:": "尽管波罗马家族在沙恩的地位很强，但它有很多敌人，他们无情的攻击使该集团处于可能是有史以来最危险的境地。目前，以下团体对波罗马的利益构成了最大的威胁。",
	"{@b Daask}. The monstrous criminal guild called Daask, a pawn of the leaders of Droaam, has started launching violent raids against Boromar holdings over the last two years. A mobile organization using guerrilla tactics, Daask has managed to circumvent Boromar security and avoid serious reprisals for a range of violent thefts and sabotages. Agents of Daask go out of their way to harm up-and-coming Boromar agents.": "{@b Daask}. 被称为Daask的畸形犯罪行会是Droaam领导人的棋子，在过去两年中开始对Boromar的财产发动暴力袭击。作为一个使用游击战术的流动组织，Daask已经成功地绕过了Boromar的安全，并避免了一系列暴力盗窃和破坏行为的严重报复。达斯克的特工不顾一切地伤害新晋的Boromar特工。",
	"{@b Sharn Council}. Despite four friends on the city council, the Boromar Clan has several enemies as well. At least three councilors oppose the Boromars because of genuine concern for their constituents; two more oppose the syndicate because they're part of rival organizations (the Aurum and the Tyrants). Because of their influence, the council has so far refused to devote any resources to combating the rise of Daask, hoping the monstrous guild will bring down the Boromars. Individual members of the Boromar Clan can be sure that these councilors will oppose any petition they might bring to the council.": "{@b Sharn Council}. 尽管市议会中有四个朋友，但波罗马家族也有几个敌人。至少有三位议员因为真正关心他们的选民而反对Boromars；还有两位议员因为是敌对组织（Aurum和Tyrants）的成员而反对该集团。由于他们的影响力，议会至今拒绝投入任何资源来打击达斯克的崛起，希望这个畸形的行会能打倒波罗马人。波罗玛氏族的个别成员可以确信，这些议员会反对他们可能提交给议会的任何请愿书。",
	"With a crime syndicate as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:": "如果有一个犯罪集团作为你的团体的赞助人，你会获得以下好处。",
	"The annual Tain Gala, as everyone knows, brings the wealthiest and most prominent citizens of Sharn together in a grand display of opulence and power. But last night, it also provided a shocking display of violence, as Saidan Boromar—head of the Boromar family, which is allegedly tied to all manner of criminal activities throughout the city—was confronted by a would-be assassin (whose name will not be made public until her next of kin have been identified and notified). Boromar and his wife, Mala Boromar d'Jorasco, escaped unharmed thanks to the timely intervention of their bodyguard, a recent immigrant from the Talenta Plains whose fascinating culture and fierce demeanor were both in plain view last night. A Boromar spokesperson identified the bodyguard as Halak Boromar, head of the Clawfoots—the Boromar family's personal guard, named for the dinosaurs ridden by halflings in the Talenta Plains.": "众所周知，一年一度的泰恩盛会将沙恩最富有和最有名望的公民聚集在一起，隆重展示财富和权力。但昨晚，它也提供了一个令人震惊的暴力展示，因为赛丹-博罗玛--博罗玛家族的首领，据称与整个城市的各种犯罪活动有关--被一个可能的刺客（在她的近亲被确认和通知之前，她的名字不会被公开）撞见。博罗玛和他的妻子玛拉-博罗玛-乔拉斯科（Mala Boromar d'Jorasco）安然无恙，这要归功于他们的保镖的及时干预，他是来自塔伦塔平原的新移民，其迷人的文化和凶狠的举止都在昨晚一览无余。波洛马的发言人指出，这位保镖名叫哈拉克-波洛马，是波洛马家族的私人护卫队队长，以塔伦塔平原上半身人骑的恐龙命名。",
	"{@b Assignments}. The Boromar Clan doesn't pay you, but it might assign you to particular tasks. Sometimes these are tasks someone has hired the syndicate to perform (such as an assassination), in which case the syndicate passes 85 percent of the fee on to your group. Other times, your aim is to enrich the syndicate (such as by pulling off a heist), in which case you have the privilege of keeping 85 percent of what you steal. Other syndicates might take more or less than a 15 percent share, at the DM's discretion.": "{@b Assignments}. 波洛玛氏族不付给你报酬，但它可能会指派你完成特定的任务。有时，这些任务是有人雇佣该集团执行的（如暗杀），在这种情况下，该集团会将85%的费用转给你的团队。还有一些时候，你的目的是为了丰富集团的财富（例如通过抢劫），在这种情况下，你有特权保留你所偷的东西的85%。其他辛迪加可能会多拿或少拿15%的份额，由DM决定。",
	"{@b Contraband}. You have access to your syndicate's \"business\" of dealing with contraband, such as poisons or narcotics. You don't receive a discount on these goods, but you can always find someplace to purchase them.": "{@b Contraband}. 你可以进入你的辛迪加的 \"业务\"，处理违禁品，如毒药或麻醉品。你在这些货物上得不到折扣，但你总能找到地方购买它们。",
	"{@b Fences}. Members or associates of your syndicate are skilled at disposing of stolen goods, and you have access to this service as well. Fences are useful for selling not just illicit goods but also expensive items such as works of art and even magic items. In the case of magic items, this allows you to delegate the work of finding a buyer (a downtime activity described in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} and {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}) to the fence. The drawback is that you don't get to choose whether to accept the offer you might receive—the fence makes that call for you.": "{@b Fences}. 你的集团成员或同伙擅长处理赃物，你也可以使用这项服务。栅栏不仅对出售非法货物很有用，而且对出售昂贵的物品，如艺术品甚至魔法物品也很有用。就魔法物品而言，这允许你将寻找买家的工作（在{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}和{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}中描述的停机活动）委托给围栏。缺点是，你不能选择是否接受你可能收到的报价--栅栏为你做了这个决定。",
	"{@b Immunity}. As a member of the Boromar Clan, you are protected from other members of the clan. No one in your syndicate targets you for their own criminal operations. (Of course, the same is expected of you.) On the other hand, if you have rivals within the clan, they might find other ways to interfere with your activities.": "{@b Immunity}. 作为波洛马氏族的成员，你受到保护，不受该氏族其他成员的影响。你的集团中没有人以你为目标进行他们自己的犯罪活动。(当然，对你也是如此。）另一方面，如果你在氏族内有对手，他们可能会找到其他方法来干扰你的活动。",
	"{@b Syndicate-Owned Businesses}. The Boromar Clan owns several businesses, primarily as fronts for laundering money. When you buy from one of these businesses, you get a 5 percent discount. The DM decides what goods and services are available.": "{@b Syndicate-Owned Businesses}. Boromar家族拥有几家企业，主要是作为洗钱的幌子。当你从这些企业中购买时，你可以得到5%的折扣。DM决定有哪些商品和服务。",
	"Naturally, a large portion of the Boromar Clan's members come from a criminal background. There's no reason characters with other backgrounds can't be part of the syndicate, though. The Boromars recruit ex-soldiers as muscle, trained sages for research, sailors to crew smuggling vessels, and charlatans and urchins for their unique talents. Consider some or all of these roles for characters in your party:": "自然，博洛玛家族的大部分成员都有犯罪背景。不过，没有理由其他背景的人物不能成为该集团的一员。波罗玛人招募退役士兵作为肌肉，招募训练有素的圣人进行研究，招募水手作为走私船的船员，招募江湖骗子和顽童以发挥他们的独特才能。考虑在你的队伍中扮演这些角色中的一部分或全部。",
	"{@b Bruiser}. Sometimes subtlety means breaking just one of a snitch's kneecaps. The Bruiser uses force and the threat of force to make sure that the crime syndicate gets what it wants. Strength is a natural prerequisite for the role, but Charisma can also be useful, especially when combined with proficiency in {@skill Intimidation} to reinforce the danger inherent in the Bruiser's presence. Plenty of Bruisers have a criminal past, but former soldiers are often recruited into this role as well. Fighters and rogues make natural Bruisers.": "{@b Bruiser}. 有时微妙的做法意味着只需打破一个告密者的膝盖骨。恶棍使用武力和武力威胁来确保犯罪集团得到它想要的东西。力量是这个角色的先决条件，但魅力也是有用的，特别是当与精通{@skill Intimidation}相结合时，可以加强布鲁斯的内在危险。很多布鲁斯人都有犯罪的过去，但前士兵也经常被招募到这个角色。战士和流氓是天然的布鲁斯人。",
	"{@b Burglar}. Agile and nimble, the Burglar relies on Dexterity and proficiency in skills such as {@skill Acrobatics}, {@skill Sleight of Hand}, and {@skill Stealth} to get in to a target location, take valuables, and get out without being noticed. Some Burglars specialize in certain types of theft, such as housebreaking or picking pockets. Besides characters with the criminal background, young urchins often find a place in criminal syndicates by filling this role. Rogues are natural Burglars, but anyone else with the right combination of skills and abilities can do the job.": "{@b Burglar}. 敏捷和灵活，盗贼依靠灵巧和熟练的技能，如{@skill Acrobatics}、{@skill Sleight of Hand}和{@skill Stealth}，进入目标地点，拿走贵重物品，然后不被发现地离开。有些盗贼专门从事某些类型的盗窃，如破门而入或扒窃口袋。除了有犯罪背景的人物，年轻的顽童经常通过扮演这个角色在犯罪集团中找到一席之地。罗格是天生的盗贼，但其他任何拥有正确技能和能力组合的人都可以做这项工作。",
	"{@b Mastermind}. Somebody has to be the brains of any criminal operation—that's where the Mastermind comes in. A high Intelligence benefits this character, as does proficiency in skills such as {@skill Insight} and {@skill Investigation}. Masterminds often come from backgrounds such as acolyte, noble, or sage, that give them a broad range of knowledge to support their schemes. Bards, rogues, and wizards are often drawn to this role.": "{@b Mastermind}. 任何犯罪活动都必须有人负责，这就是主谋的作用。高智力对这个人物有利，熟练掌握{@skill Insight}和{@skill Investigation}等技能也是如此。策划者通常来自于圣徒、贵族或贤者等背景，这使他们拥有广泛的知识来支持他们的计划。吟游诗人、流氓和巫师经常被吸引到这个角色。",
	"{@b Safecracker}. The \"breaking\" part of \"breaking and entering\" is the Safecracker's job. A typical Safecracker might have proficiency with thieves' tools, as well as the Dexterity required to use them expertly. Intelligence can be important for figuring out complicated locks and secret doors. Many Safecrackers also boast a high Strength for those cases where lockpicks fail. Safecrackers often come from criminal backgrounds, but characters with experience using other tools and devices, including guild artisans and even sailors, also fall naturally into this role. Artificer or rogue makes a natural class choice for the Safecracker.": "{@b Safecracker}. 破门而入 \"中的 \"破门 \"部分是安全窃贼的工作。一个典型的盗贼可能会熟练掌握盗贼的工具，以及熟练使用这些工具所需的灵巧能力。智力对于弄清复杂的锁和秘密的门很重要。许多安全钳工还拥有很高的实力，以应对锁具失效的情况。安全钳工通常有犯罪背景，但有使用其他工具和设备经验的人物，包括行会工匠甚至水手，也会自然而然地进入这个角色。工匠或流氓是安全钳工的自然等级选择。",
	"{@b Talker}. From con artists to fences, anyone who relies on interpersonal skills and a network of contacts falls into the role of the Talker. Charisma proves useful for this role, along with proficiencies in skills such as {@skill Deception}, {@skill Intimidation}, and {@skill Persuasion}. The charlatan background is perfect for Talkers, but criminals, urchins, and others can fill the role with the right skills. Bards are a natural fit for the job as well.": "{@b Talker}. 从骗子到围墙，任何依靠人际关系技巧和联系网络的人都属于谈话者的角色。魅力对这一角色很有用，同时还需要精通一些技能，如（1%）、（2%）和（3%）。骗子的背景很适合说话者，但罪犯、顽童和其他人也可以用合适的技能来扮演这个角色。吟游诗人也很自然地适合这个工作。",
	"Your work as syndicate members involves more than simple street swindles or pickpocketing. A team with your skills comes together for greater purposes—more dangerous risks and far more splendid rewards. As a group, consider the options on the Syndicate Crimes table and work with your DM to decide what kinds of work you do for the Boromar Clan.": "作为集团成员，你们的工作不仅仅涉及简单的街头诈骗或扒窃。一个拥有你的技能的团队会为了更伟大的目标而聚在一起--更危险的风险和更丰厚的回报。作为一个团体，考虑一下 \"辛迪加犯罪 \"表中的选项，并与你的DM一起决定你为波罗马家族做哪些工作。",
	"{@b Acquisitions and Retrieval}. Your job is to acquire assets for the syndicate. You might steal important documents or clear out a location for use as a hideout.": "{@b Acquisitions and Retrieval}. 你的工作是为该集团获取资产。你可能会偷取重要的文件，或者清理出一个地点作为藏身之处。",
	"{@b Heists}. You plan and execute elaborate robberies that require the skills of everyone on your team.": "{@b Heists}. 你计划并执行精心设计的抢劫案，需要你团队中每个人的技能。",
	"{@b Gang Warfare}. Your primary job is to ensure that no other crime syndicate (such as Daask or House Tarkanan) gains a significant foothold in your territory.": "{@b Gang Warfare}. 你的主要工作是确保没有其他犯罪集团（如Daask或Tarkanan家族）在你的领土上获得一个重要的立足点。",
	"{@b Internal Affairs}. Your task is to keep all the corrupt, headstrong, and avaricious members of your syndicate in line with the goals and rules of the group.": "{@b Internal Affairs}. 你的任务是让你的集团中所有腐败的、刚愎自用的、贪婪的成员与集团的目标和规则保持一致。",
	"{@b Assassination}. Your work involves killing prominent people—the sort who have numerous bodyguards and elaborate security systems to circumvent.": "{@b Assassination}. 你的工作涉及杀戮知名人士--那种有众多保镖和精心设计的安全系统可以规避的人。",
	"{@b Topple the Powerful}. Your syndicate might be criminal and your methods illegal, but your goals are righteous. You help people who are powerless to defend themselves against exploitation by the rich and powerful.": "{@b Topple the Powerful}. 你的集团可能是犯罪，你的方法是非法的，但你的目标是正义的。你帮助那些无力保护自己免受富人和权贵剥削的人。",
	"Even among the notorious Boromar Clan, your group has a distinct identity and a reputation. What's the event or unique trait that makes your crew stand out? Consult the Group Infamy table for suggestions on how your group might stand out within the larger syndicate.": "即使在臭名昭著的波罗马家族中，你们的团队也有一个独特的身份和声誉。是什么事件或独特的特质让你的团队脱颖而出？请参考团体恶名表，看看你的团体如何在更大的集团中脱颖而出。",
	"{@b Tattoos}. Each member of your group has a distinct tattoo that inspires fear in others. When possible, you use the symbol as a calling card to mark your work.": "{@b Tattoos}. 你们小组的每个成员都有一个独特的纹身，能激发别人的恐惧。在可能的情况下，你用这个符号作为名片来标记你的工作。",
	"{@b Outfit}. Whether it is a leather duster with a group symbol or a distinctive handkerchief tucked in your pocket, your gang has a signature accessory.": "{@b Outfit}. 无论是带有团体标志的皮革掸子，还是塞在口袋里的独特手帕，你的团伙都有一个标志性的配件。",
	"{@b Infamy}. Your group is linked to an infamous crime, one that remains the talk of the town.": "{@b Infamy}. 你的团体与一起臭名昭著的犯罪有关，这起犯罪仍然是镇上的话题。",
	"{@b Idols}. A certain type of person finds criminals alluring, and your band has acquired a group of such hangers-on. They're not criminals themselves, just outsiders who admire you for your brutality, cunning, or flair.": "{@b Idols}. 某种类型的人觉得罪犯很诱人，而你的乐队已经获得了一群这样的挂靠者。他们本身不是罪犯，只是因为你的残暴、狡猾或天赋而钦佩你的外人。",
	"{@b Legitimate}. The Boromar Clan has a legitimate front, though everyone knows the truth behind it. You're part of that facade of legitimacy, but you have a reputation for getting away with (literal) murder.": "{@b Legitimate}. Boromar家族有一个合法的幌子，尽管每个人都知道它背后的真相。你是这个合法幌子的一部分，但你有逃脱（字面）谋杀的声誉。",
	"{@b Legends}. You have an air of mystery, and people whisper that you command strange powers. True or not, this reputation keeps people out of your way.": "{@b Legends}. 你有一种神秘的气息，人们低声说你拥有奇怪的力量。不管是真是假，这种声誉使人们对你敬而远之。",
	"Some criminals believe you can't do a job without betraying your partners. Perhaps you have your own share of adversaries you've angered. The Group Rivals table presents a host of groups and individuals who might—legitimately or otherwise—hold a grudge against you.": "一些罪犯认为，你不背叛你的伙伴就无法完成工作。也许你也有自己的对手被你激怒。团体对手表列出了许多团体和个人，他们可能--合法的或其他的--对你怀有怨恨。",
	"{@b The Law}. Someone in the Sharn Watch has vowed to put you in prison or die trying.": "{@b The Law}. 沙恩观察的某个人发誓要把你送进监狱，否则就得死。",
	"{@b Gang War}. Some members of a rival syndicate (such as Daask, House Tarkanan, or the Tyrants) hate you, probably for good reason.": "{@b Gang War}. 敌对集团的一些成员（如达斯克、塔卡南家族或暴君）讨厌你，可能有充分的理由。",
	"{@b The Press}. Your group's adventures make for great headlines. Your every move is reported in the broadsheets and your steps are dogged by journalists.": "{@b The Press}. 你的团体的冒险是很好的头条新闻。你的一举一动都会被大报报道，你的脚步也会被记者追问。",
	"{@b Infighting}. Another group within the Boromar Clan is jealous of your success or angry about a past wrong. They do everything they can to undercut you.": "{@b Infighting}. 波洛马氏族中的另一个团体嫉妒你的成功，或对过去的错误感到愤怒。他们尽其所能地削弱你。",
	"{@b Vigilante}. A citizen you wronged has sworn vengeance. Around any corner, you might find yourself facing a vigilante or a posse of angry citizens out for your blood.": "{@b Vigilante}. 一个被你冤枉的公民发誓要报仇。在任何一个角落，你都可能发现自己面对的是一个义务警员或一群愤怒的公民，他们要杀你。",
	"{@b The Bosses}. The halfling family in control of the syndicate has its eye on you, taking pains to keep you in line and make sure you stay loyal.": "{@b The Bosses}. 控制集团的半身人家族盯上了你，不遗余力地让你保持一致，确保你保持忠诚。",
	"Everyone has a well-defined place in the Boromar Clan hierarchy. You report to a contact who oversees your work, giving you assignments, and collecting the syndicate's cut. This person might be a criminal mastermind who plans all your exploits, or they could leave the planning to your group. In any case, the Syndicate Contact table can help you define the personality of this contact.": "每个人在波洛马氏族的等级制度中都有一个明确的位置。你向一个监督你工作的联系人报告，给你分配任务，并收取集团的分成。这个人可能是一个计划你所有行动的犯罪主谋，或者他们可以把计划留给你的小组。在任何情况下，辛迪加联系人表可以帮助你定义这个联系人的个性。",
	"A surrogate parent who views you as challenging but beloved children": "一个将你们视为具有挑战性但受人喜爱的孩子的代理家长",
	"A no-nonsense boss who treats the syndicate's work as just another business": "一个不苟言笑的老板，把辛迪加的工作当作另一项业务。",

	"A former urchin, now fabulously wealthy, who wants to see everyone in the syndicate find the same success": "一个曾经的顽童，现在富得流油，他希望看到集团中的每个人都能找到同样的成功。",
	"The boss at a gambling den or similar house of vice who enjoys the business just a little too much": "赌馆或类似的淫秽场所的老板，他只是有点太喜欢这一行了。",
	"A kind-hearted crook who's grateful to finally be able to delegate the dirty work on the streets to you": "一个心地善良的骗子，终于可以把街上的脏活累活交给你，他很感激。",

	"A former law enforcement officer who is full of cheerful tips for avoiding the law": "一位前执法官员，对避开法律充满了欢快的提示",
	"The city of Sharn is unusual in that it is home to no less than four powerful syndicates, which somehow have not yet managed to wipe each other out. The Boromar Clan is one crime syndicate, while the others include the following groups:": "沙恩市的不寻常之处在于，它是不少于四个强大的集团的家，而这些集团不知为何还没有设法消灭对方。波洛马氏族是一个犯罪集团，而其他集团包括以下几个。",
	"Imagine it: a long-lasting state of euphoria, a feeling of power and energy, a measurable impact on certain magical powers, and the risk of addiction and deadly overdose with every use. That's the thrill of the drug called dragon's blood, which currently enjoys skyrocketing popularity in Sharn. Every day the death toll from this mysterious substance rises among \"blood addicts.\" And no wonder, as it's produced in Droaam and sold in drams or \"veins\" by the monstrous thugs of Daask, who surely seek nothing less than to destroy the prosperity of Sharn but targeting its most precious resource: its sober, hardworking people. Remember friends, \"Stay on the wagon. Say NO to dragon!\"": "想象一下：一种持久的兴奋状态，一种力量和能量的感觉，对某些魔力有可衡量的影响，以及每次使用都有上瘾和致命的过量风险。这就是被称为龙血的药物所带来的快感，它目前在沙恩享有极高的人气。每天，这种神秘物质造成的死亡人数在 \"血瘾者 \"中不断上升。这也难怪，因为它产自德拉姆，由达斯克的畸形暴徒以德拉姆或 \"静脉 \"的形式出售，他们肯定只想破坏沙恩的繁荣，但目标是它最宝贵的资源：它清醒、勤劳的人民。记住朋友们，\"留在马车上。对龙说不！\"",
	"{@b Daask}. Daask is an aggressive criminal organization with cells across Khorvaire. Led by monstrous immigrants from Droaam—gnolls, harpies, medusas, minotaurs, ogres, trolls, and others—the group is ultimately under the command of Sora Katra, one of the rulers of Droaam. Physical violence is its specialty, but Daask also dabbles in illegal drugs.": "{@b Daask}. 达斯克（Daask）是一个咄咄逼人的犯罪组织，在霍尔韦尔各地都有分部。该组织由来自德拉姆（Droaam）的畸形移民领导，其中包括巨魔、女妖、梅杜莎人、牛头人、食人魔、巨魔等，最终受德拉姆统治者之一索拉-卡特拉（Sora Katra）的指挥。身体暴力是其专长，但达斯克也涉足非法毒品。",
	"{@b House Tarkanan}. House Tarkanan is known as a small order of highly skilled assassins and thieves in Sharn. Less well known is the fact that this guild consists primarily of criminals who bear aberrant dragonmarks—hence its choice of namesake, as Lord Halas Tarkanan united the bearers of these marks during the ancient War of the Mark.": "{@b House Tarkanan}. 塔卡南家族是沙恩的一个由高技能刺客和盗贼组成的小团体。鲜为人知的是，这个公会主要由带有异常龙纹的罪犯组成--因此它选择了这个名字，因为哈拉斯-塔卡南勋爵在古代的龙纹战争中联合了这些龙纹的持有者。",
	"{@b The Tyrants}. The Tyrants are a mysterious group of shapeshifters who traffic in all manner of information. They sell secrets, blackmail powerful people, and forge everything from identification papers to coins and works of art.": "{@b The Tyrants}. 暴君们是一个神秘的变身者团体，他们贩卖各种信息。他们出售秘密，勒索有权势的人，并伪造从身份证明文件到硬币和艺术品的一切。",
	"{@b Running Your Own}. Rather than join an existing syndicate, you can start your own. You need to establish your own headquarters and direct the activities of the {@dice 3d6} criminals who work for you. By claiming a 15 percent share of their take, you can rely on an income that will sustain you at a modest lifestyle, plus an additional {@dice 1d6} gp in profit per week. You can access contraband and fences as described earlier in this section, but you don't get a discount at syndicate-owned businesses unless you acquire some businesses of your own. You can also use the Running a Business downtime activity to direct the activities of your syndicate.": "{@b Running Your Own}. 与其加入一个现有的辛迪加，你可以开始你自己的。你需要建立自己的总部，并指导为你工作的（1%）罪犯的活动。通过索取他们15%的份额，你可以依靠收入来维持你适度的生活方式，再加上每周额外的{@dice 1d6}金币的利润。你可以像本节前面描述的那样获得违禁品和栅栏，但你在集团所有的企业中得不到折扣，除非你自己收购一些企业。你也可以使用 \"经营企业 \"的停工活动来指导你的辛迪加集团的活动。",
	"Your group works for one of the most influential organizations in Khorvaire: the dragonmarked houses. Whether or not any member of your group carries a dragonmark or is even related to one of the houses by blood, you act on behalf of a house to advance its interests. You might function openly as representatives of the house, wearing its badge and exerting its authority, or you could be covert or unacknowledged agents.": "你们的团体为霍尔韦尔最有影响力的组织之一工作：有龙纹的家族。无论你的团队中是否有成员带着龙纹，甚至是否与某个家族有血缘关系，你都代表某个家族行事，以促进其利益。你们可以作为该家族的代表公开运作，佩戴其徽章并行使其权力，或者你们可以是秘密的或不被承认的代理人。",
	"The thirteen dragonmarked houses are described in detail earlier in this chapter.": "本章前面详细介绍了这十三座龙纹屋。",
	"With a dragonmarked house as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:": "如果有一个龙纹屋作为你的团体的守护者，你会获得以下好处。",
	"{@b Compensation}. Your patron house pays you for the work you do on its behalf. On average, the house pays each member of your group an amount equal to 10 gp × the average level of your characters per day you spend on the mission.": "{@b Compensation}. 你的庇护所为你所做的工作支付你。平均来说，家族会支付给你们每个成员一笔相当于10GP×你们的角色平均等级的金额，每一天你们都会花在任务上。",
	"{@b House Services}. When you require the services provided by your patron house, you can secure them at a discounted rate (10 percent off the normal charge). You might also be able to trade in a favor to get extraordinary services or a larger discount.": "{@b House Services}. 当你需要你的主顾家提供的服务时，你可以以折扣价（正常收费的10%）来保证他们。你也许还可以用人情来换取非凡的服务或更大的折扣。",
	"{@b Independence}. Each member of your group is issued papers that identifies you as agents of your patron house. Because the dragonmarked houses are bound to political neutrality by the terms of the ancient Korth Edicts, these papers guarantee you the right to travel freely across national borders on the business of your patron house. (If you assert that you are on the business of the house, even if you aren't, border agents are unlikely to challenge you.)": "{@b Independence}. 你们小组的每个成员都会获得证件，以表明你们是你们守护家族的代理人。因为有龙纹的家族受古老的科思法令条款的约束而保持政治中立，这些证件保证你有权为你的守护家族的业务而自由穿越国境。 如果你声称你是为家族的业务而来，即使你不是，边境人员也不可能质疑你。",
	"Dragonmarked houses employ adventurers who suit their needs. The roles characters play in a group with a dragonmarked house patron often have more to do with their relationship to the house than with the specific roles in the party. Consider some or all of these roles for your characters:": "龙纹屋雇用适合他们需要的冒险者。角色在有龙纹屋守护者的团体中所扮演的角色往往与他们与龙纹屋的关系有关，而不是与派对中的具体角色有关。你可以考虑为你的角色设置一些或所有这些角色。",
	"{@b Adventurer}. Some characters are associated with your patron house because of their connection to its ruling family or its businesses. The Adventurer, though, is hired by the house for more traditional adventuring skills—usually capabilities that the house's other agents lack. The Adventurer might have a wide range of abilities, particular to whatever needs the House has at the time. Many with peculiar skills or highly specific fields of expertise find themselves in the employ of dragonmarked houses or house members with eccentric interests and deep pockets.": "{@b Adventurer}. 有些角色与你的守护家族有关，因为他们与该家族的统治者或其企业有联系。不过，冒险家受雇于该家族是为了获得更多传统的冒险技能--通常是该家族的其他代理人所缺乏的能力。冒险家可能拥有广泛的能力，特别是满足家族当时的任何需求。许多拥有奇特技能或高度具体的专业领域的人发现自己受雇于有龙纹的家族或拥有古怪兴趣和深厚财力的家族成员。",
	"{@b Guilder}. Every dragonmarked house is more than a single family. Each house encompasses at least one guild that operates just like a traditional craft or trade guild, and hundreds of people associate with these guilds while having no other relationship to the houses that oversee them. The Guilder is among these, perhaps being a skilled physician or cleric in House Jorasco's Healers Guild, for example, or an inquisitive associated with House Tharashk's Finders Guild. The Guilder might have the guild artisan background or some other set of skills suited to the specialties of your patron house's guilds.": "{@b Guilder}. 每个龙纹屋都不只是一个单一的家庭。每个家族至少有一个公会，其运作方式就像传统的手工业或贸易公会一样，有数百人与这些公会有联系，而与监督它们的家族没有其他关系。行会成员就是其中之一，比如说，他可能是乔拉斯科家族治疗师公会的一名熟练医生或牧师，或者是与塔拉什克家族的发现者公会有关的一名好奇者。行会成员可能有公会工匠的背景，或者其他一些适合你的守护家族的公会专长的技能。",
	"{@b Heir}. The Heir is a member of your dragonmarked house patron, related by blood and carrying the house name. This character most likely chooses the race that matches the bloodline of the house. The Heir can be dragonmarked (with the appropriate marked subrace or racial variant) or unmarked. The house agent background (described in this chapter) proves particularly appropriate for this character.": "{@b Heir}. 继承人是你的龙纹家族守护者的成员，有血缘关系，并带有家族的名字。这个角色很可能选择与家族血统相匹配的种族。继承人可以是龙纹（有适当的龙纹亚种或种族变体）或无龙纹。家族代理人的背景（在本章中描述）被证明特别适合这个角色。",
	"Your group and your DM should decide together which house employs you. The nature of the missions you undertake depends in part on the house or guild you work for, but there are general categories of work that every house needs agents to perform on its behalf. The House Missions table provides suggestions for which house might employ you along with multiple possibilities for adventures that overlap with their interests. For the more general kind of work you might carry out on behalf of any dragonmarked house, consult the General House Missions table.": "你的小组和你的DM应该一起决定哪个家族雇用你。你所承担的任务的性质部分取决于你为之工作的家族或公会，但每个家族都需要代理人代表它完成一些一般的工作。家族任务表提供了关于哪个家族可能雇用你的建议，以及与他们的兴趣相重合的多种冒险的可能性。关于你可能代表任何龙纹家族进行的更一般的工作，请参考一般家族任务表。",

In any case, use the Group Status table to determine your party's standing within the organization.": "龙纹屋内的政治可能是恶性的。也许你是家族领导层最喜欢的子孙。也许你因为自己或他人的不当行为而被放逐出你的家族。在任何情况下，使用团体地位表来确定你的政党在组织中的地位。",

	"Reports emerged this week of bitter disputes within the Twelve, the arcane institution that supposedly embodies the spirit of cooperation among the houses. According to a source that wished to remain anonymous, a special meeting of the Committee of Twelve was called last week to address accusations that researchers connected to House Kundarak had been diverting funds from the institute's budget to fund their own private projects, then concealing the results of those projects from their colleagues. Kundarak's representative, according to our source, denied the accusations, saying that the researchers are operating within their allotted budget and keeping their results secret only temporarily, as a matter of house security.": "本周出现了关于十二宫内部激烈争论的报告，十二宫是一个神秘的机构，据称体现了各宫之间的合作精神。据一位不愿透露姓名的消息人士称，上周十二院委员会召开了一次特别会议，以解决与昆达拉克家族有关的研究人员从研究所的预算中挪用资金来资助他们自己的私人项目，然后向他们的同事隐瞒这些项目的结果。据我们的消息来源称，昆达拉克的代表否认了这些指控，说研究人员是在其分配的预算范围内运作的，只是为了房子的安全而暂时对他们的结果保密。",
	"This matter is far from resolved, as the council meeting devolved into shouted arguments before disbanding. Representatives of House Medani and House Tharashk were particularly vocal in denouncing Kundarak, leaving this reporter to wonder whether a schism within the Council of Twelve might be imminent—and what that might mean for peaceful relations among the dragonmarked houses themselves.": "这件事远没有得到解决，因为理事会会议在解散前演变成了大喊大叫的争论。梅丹妮家族和塔拉什克家族的代表在谴责昆达拉克时特别大声，让本报记者怀疑十二人理事会内部的分裂是否迫在眉睫--这对有龙纹的家族之间的和平关系可能意味着什么。",
	"The Twelve facilitates communication and cooperation among the dragonmarked houses. As part of the agreements that ended the War of the Mark, the houses agreed to create an institute for the application of magic—a foundation that would study dragonmarks, along with more traditional forms of magic. Over the centuries, the Twelve has been responsible for many magical advances, including the airships operated by House Lyrandar and the message stations of House Sivis": "十二院促进了龙纹家族之间的交流与合作。作为结束龙纹战争的协议的一部分，各家族同意创建一个魔法应用研究所--一个研究龙纹和更多传统形式的魔法的基金会。几个世纪以来，十二院一直负责许多魔法方面的进步，包括利兰达家族运营的飞艇和西维斯家族的信息站。",
	"As an arm of the dragonmarked houses, the Twelve attempted to remain neutral during the Last War, but many of its wizards and artificers had national loyalties that were stronger than their ties to the institute. Now that the Twelve has resumed normal operations, it seeks to replace its lost members and make sure that each house is represented.": "作为龙纹家族的一个分支，十二星座试图在最后的战争中保持中立，但它的许多巫师和工匠的国家忠诚度比他们与学院的关系更强。现在，十二院已经恢复了正常的运作，它试图取代其失去的成员，并确保每个家族都有代表。",
	"While the Twelve provides a way for your group to work for multiple dragonmarked houses, its goals and benefits are similar to those of an individual house. Consider using the following details as a template if there's a particular dragonmarked house you wish to serve.": "虽然十二宫为你的团体提供了一种为多个龙纹屋工作的方式，但其目标和利益与单个龙纹屋相似。如果有一个特定的龙纹屋是你希望服务的，可以考虑使用下面的细节作为模板。",
	"As a patron, the Twelve is functionally similar to a dragonmarked house. Rather than advancing one house's interests, though, the Twelve seeks to advance magical developments that have practical value to society as well as potential for profit. All the houses contribute to the operating budget of the institute, and in theory they all benefit from the results of its research.": "作为一个赞助人，十二宫在功能上类似于一个有龙纹的家族。不过，十二宫并不是为了促进某个家族的利益，而是为了推动对社会有实际价值的魔法发展，以及潜在的利润。所有家族都为研究所的运营预算做出贡献，理论上他们都能从研究所的研究成果中获益。"
