	"The world of Eberron has a rich history built on heroic deeds, evolving magic, and the wounds of a long, devastating war. Action, adventure, good, evil, and a thousand shades of gray paint the landscape in broad strokes. Ancient mysteries await discovery so they can influence the world and its people.": "Eberron世界有着丰富的历史，它建立在英雄的事迹、不断发展的魔法以及长期的、毁灭性的战争的创伤之上。行动、冒险、正义、邪恶，以及无数的灰色阴影，都在大笔大笔地描绘着这个世界。古老的奥秘等待着人们去发现，从而影响这个世界和它的人民。",
	"Magic is built into the very fabric of the world. It pervades everyday life. It provides comforts and conveniences unknown in either the modern world or any world of medieval fantasy. Great cities where castles scrape the sky prosper throughout the continent of Khorvaire, and a thriving aristocracy of merchant families controls much of the world's economy thanks to the edge given them by the mysterious and rare dragonmarks. Its people harness magic as a tool—to build cities, to sail ships through the skies, and to create both wonders and weapons.": "魔法是建立在世界的结构中的。它弥漫在日常生活中。它提供了现代世界或任何中世纪幻想世界所不知道的舒适和便利。在整个霍尔韦尔大陆上，城堡在天空中飞舞，一个繁荣的商人家族贵族控制着世界经济的大部分，这要归功于神秘而稀有的龙纹给他们带来的优势。它的人民利用魔法作为工具，建造城市，在天空中航行，并创造奇迹和武器。",
	"Heroes come in all shapes and sizes, all classes and races. They travel the world, battling villains in instants of over-the-top action. And they unearth fabulous treasure, and deal with narrow escapes and ominous mysteries that are as likely to shed light on centuries of secrets as they are to threaten the world's safety.": "英雄有各种形状和大小，各种等级和种族。他们周游世界，在瞬息万变的行动中与恶棍搏斗。他们发掘出神奇的宝藏，处理险象环生和不祥的谜团，这些谜团既可能揭开几个世纪的秘密，也可能威胁到世界的安全。",
	"Eberron embraces swashbuckling action and pulp adventure while adding a layer of noir intrigue. Stories don't always end well, and there isn't a perfect answer to every problem. The Last War turned old allies into bitter enemies and destroyed an entire nation, leaving behind terrible scars. Crime and corruption lurk in the great cities of Khorvaire. Hidden dragons shape the course of history, and sinister fiends influence the dreams of the unwary. Yet mortal greed and ambition might prove more dangerous than any dragon or fiend. This darkness affords opportunities for a group of bold adventurers to make a difference—for better or for worse.": "Eberron拥抱了挥舞的动作和纸浆冒险，同时加入了一层黑色的阴谋。故事的结局并不总是好的，也不是每个问题都有完美的答案。最后的战争将旧的盟友变成了痛苦的敌人，摧毁了整个国家，留下了可怕的伤痕。犯罪和腐败潜伏在Khorvaire的伟大城市中。隐藏的龙塑造了历史的进程，阴险的魔鬼影响着不怀好意者的梦想。然而，凡人的贪婪和野心可能比任何龙或魔鬼更危险。这片黑暗为一群大胆的冒险家提供了改变现状的机会--无论好坏。",

	"What is Eberron? Here are the key things to know:": "什么是Eberron？以下是需要了解的关键事项。",
	"{@b 1. The Last War Has Ended—Sort Of}. The Last War plunged the continent of Khorvaire into civil war more than a century ago, shattering the Five Nations that made up the kingdom of Galifar. Just two years ago, the war ended with the signing of the Treaty of Thronehold and the establishment of twelve recognized nations and a tenuous peace. The conflicts, the anger, and the pain of the long war remain, however, and the new nations seek every advantage as they prepare for the next war to break out on the continent.": "{@b 1. The Last War Has Ended—Sort Of}. 一个多世纪前，最后一次战争使霍尔韦尔大陆陷入内战，使组成加利法尔王国的五个国家支离破碎。就在两年前，战争结束了，签署了《王权条约》，建立了12个公认的国家和脆弱的和平。然而，长期战争的冲突、愤怒和痛苦依然存在，新的国家在为大陆上爆发的下一场战争做准备时寻求一切优势。",
	"{@b 2. Dragonmarked Dynasties}. The great dragonmarked families are the barons of industry and commerce throughout Khorvaire and beyond. Their influence transcends political boundaries, and they remained mostly neutral during the Last War. Not technically citizens of any nation, the matriarchs and patriarchs of each house live in splendor within their enclaves and emporiums located throughout Khorvaire. These dynastic houses of commerce derive their power from dragonmarks—hereditary arcane sigils that manifest on certain individuals within the family, granting them limited but useful magical abilities associated with the trade guilds each family controls.": "{@b 2. Dragonmarked Dynasties}. 伟大的龙纹家族是整个Khorvaire及其他地区的工业和商业男爵。他们的影响力超越了政治边界，在最后的战争中他们大多保持中立。严格来说，他们并不是任何国家的公民，每个家族的族长和元老都在他们位于霍尔韦尔各地的飞地和商场里过着辉煌的生活。这些商业王朝的权力来自于龙纹--遗传性的奥术符号，这些符号体现在家族中的某些人身上，赋予他们与每个家族控制的贸易行会相关的有限但有用的魔法能力。",
	"{@b 3. Lands of Intrigue}. The war is over, and the nations of Khorvaire now try to build a new age of peace and prosperity. Ancient threats linger, however, and the world needs heroes to take up the cause. Nations compete on many levels—over economic dominance, political influence, territory, magical power, and more—each looking to maintain or improve its status by any means short of all-out war. Dragonmarked houses, churches both pure and corrupt, crime lords, monster gangs, psionic spies, arcane universities, secret societies, sinister masterminds, dragons, and a multitude of organizations and factions join the struggle for position and power in the aftermath of the Last War.": "{@b 3. Lands of Intrigue}. 战争结束了，Khorvaire的国家现在试图建立一个和平和繁荣的新时代。然而，古老的威胁仍然存在，世界需要英雄们来承担起这个责任。各个国家在许多层面上竞争，包括经济主导地位、政治影响、领土、魔法力量等等，每个国家都希望通过任何手段来维持或提高自己的地位，而不是通过全面战争。龙纹屋、纯洁和腐败的教会、犯罪首脑、怪物帮派、幻术间谍、奥术大学、秘密社团、阴险的主谋、龙，以及众多组织和派别都加入了最后战争后的地位和权力争夺战中。",
	"{@b 4. A Continent of Adventure}. From the jungles of Q'barra to the blasted hills and valleys of the Demon Wastes, from the skyscrapers of Sharn to the dinosaur-filled Talenta Plains, Eberron is a world of adventure. Adventures can draw heroes from one exotic location to another across the continent of Khorvaire. The quest for the Mirror of the Seventh Moon might take the heroes from a hidden mountain shrine in Darguun to a ruined castle in the Shadow Marches and finally to a dungeon deep below the Library of Korranberg. Through the use of magical transportation, heroes can reach a wide range of environments over the course of an adventure, and thus deal with a diverse assortment of monsters and other challenges.": "{@b 4. A Continent of Adventure}. 从Q'barra的丛林到恶魔荒原的爆炸山丘和山谷，从Sharn的摩天大楼到充满恐龙的Talenta平原，Eberron是一个冒险的世界。冒险可以把英雄们从一个异国情调的地方吸引到霍尔韦尔大陆上的另一个地方。对第七月之镜的探索可能会把英雄们从达尔古恩的一个隐秘的山间神殿带到阴影地带的一个破败的城堡，最后到科兰伯格图书馆下面的一个地牢。通过使用魔法运输工具，英雄们可以在冒险过程中到达广泛的环境，从而应对各种各样的怪物和其他挑战。",
	"{@b 5. A World of Magic}. The technology of Eberron has developed not through the advance of science but by the mastery of magic. The widespread use of magic pervades life in the cities and towns. Airships and rail transport make rapid travel across the continent possible. A working class of minor mages, called magewrights, uses spells to provide energy and other necessities. Advances in magic item creation have led to everything from self-propelled farming implements to sentient, free-willed beings created in artificers' forges. With the aid of rare crystals called dragonshards, dragonmarks can be made more powerful, elementals can be controlled and harnessed, and magic items can be crafted and shaped.": "{@b 5. A World of Magic}. Eberron的技术不是通过科学的进步而是通过对魔法的掌握而发展起来的。魔法的广泛使用充斥着城市和城镇的生活。飞船和铁路运输使跨越大陆的快速旅行成为可能。一个由小法师组成的工作阶层，被称为魔法师，利用法术提供能源和其他必需品。魔法物品创造的进步导致了从自走式农具到在工匠的锻造中创造的有知觉的、自由意志的生命的一切。在被称为龙石的稀有水晶的帮助下，龙印可以变得更加强大，元素可以被控制和驾驭，魔法物品也可以被制作和塑形。",
	"{@b 6. New Races}. In addition to the common player character races found in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, players can choose to play orc or goblinoid characters in Eberron. Or they can choose one of four new races: {@race changeling|ERLW|changelings}, {@race kalashtar|ERLW}, {@race shifter|ERLW|shifters}, and {@race warforged|ERLW}. Changelings have minor shapechanging abilities similar to those of doppelgangers. Kalashtar are planar entities merged with human hosts, giving them telepathic abilities. Shifters developed from the mixing of humans and lycanthropes, a union that grants them limited bestial abilities and feral instincts. The warforged are a constructed race created during the Last War, seeking to find its place in a post-war world.": "{@b 6. New Races}. 除了{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中常见的玩家角色种族外，玩家可以选择在Eberron中扮演兽人或哥布林人角色。或者他们可以从四个新种族中选择一个。{@race changeling|ERLW|changelings}, {@race kalashtar|ERLW}, {@race shifter|ERLW|shifters}, 和 {@race warforged|ERLW}。变身者拥有类似于二重身的轻微变身能力。Kalashtar是与人类宿主合并的平面实体，赋予他们心灵感应的能力。变形人由人类和狼人的混合发展而来，这种结合赋予他们有限的兽性能力和野性的本能。战神是在最后一次战争中创造出来的一个构造种族，他们试图在战后的世界中找到自己的位置。",
	"{@b 7. D&D with a Twist}. Every race, monster, spell, and magic item in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, and {@book Monster Manual|MM} has a place somewhere in Eberron, but it might not be the place you expect. Eberron has a unique spot in the D&D multiverse, and many familiar elements of the game play different roles in the world. In particular, mortal creatures are products of culture and circumstances, rather than the direct influence of the gods. As a result, you can't assume that a gold dragon is good or a beholder is evil; only in the case of celestials, fiends, and certain other creatures whose identity and worldview are shaped by magic (such as the curse of lycanthropy) is alignment a given.": "{@b 7. D&D with a Twist}. {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}、{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}和{@book Monster Manual|MM}中的每个种族、怪物、咒语和魔法物品都在Eberron的某个地方有一席之地，但可能不是你期望的地方。Eberron在D&D多元宇宙中有着独特的位置，许多熟悉的游戏元素在这个世界中扮演着不同的角色。特别是，凡人生物是文化和环境的产物，而不是诸神的直接影响。因此，你不能假设金龙是好的，或看守者是邪恶的；只有在天人、魔人和某些其他生物的身份和世界观由魔法塑造的情况下（如狼人的诅咒），才会有一致的看法。",
	"Every child knows the story of the Progenitor Dragons: Siberys, Eberron, and Khyber. In the dawn of time, these three cosmic beings created thirteen planes of existence, each embodying a concept. Their final work was the Material Plane, where all ideas would become manifest: a realm that could know war and peace, life and death, order and chaos. But cruel Khyber sought ultimate dominion over this new reality. She struck Siberys without warning and tore him apart. Eberron wrestled with Khyber and bound the traitor in her coils but could not defeat her. So Eberron became a living prison, a world that would forever contain Khyber's evil.": "每个孩子都知道始祖龙的故事：西伯利亚斯、艾伯伦和凯伯尔。在时间的黎明，这三个宇宙生物创造了13个存在的平面，每个平面都体现了一个概念。他们的最终作品是物质界，在那里所有的想法都将得到体现：一个可以知道战争与和平、生命与死亡、秩序与混乱的领域。但残酷的凯伯寻求对这个新现实的最终支配权。她毫无征兆地打击了西伯利亚，并将他撕碎。Eberron与Khyber搏斗，将叛徒捆绑在她的线圈中，但无法击败她。于是Eberron成为了一个活生生的监狱，这个世界将永远容纳Khyber的邪恶。",
	"Almost every culture in the world shares this story as a myth that explains the world. Shattered Siberys became the ring of golden dragonshards wrapped around the planet, said to be the source of magic. Eberron is the world, the source of all natural life. And Khyber is the Underdark and the source of aberrations and fiends, forever struggling against her bonds and yearning to destroy the world above.": "世界上几乎所有的文化都分享这个故事，作为解释世界的神话。碎裂的西伯利亚成为包裹着地球的金色龙鳞环，据说是魔法的来源。Eberron是世界，是所有自然生命的来源。而凯伯是地下世界，是反常者和恶魔的源头，永远在与她的束缚作斗争，渴望摧毁上面的世界。",
	"Another tale shared across cultures describes one more conflict that occurred in the first age of the world. Long ago, powerful archfiends known as the Overlords and their armies of rakshasa and lesser fiends dominated Eberron. Forces of light—some versions of the story say the nine gods of the Sovereign Host, others say an alliance of dragons and celestials—eventually defeated the Overlords. But these fiends couldn't be destroyed; instead, their immortal essences were bound in Khyber. Whatever the true details of this tale, this much is true: if the Overlords ever break their bonds, the consequences would be catastrophic.": "另一个跨文化共享的故事描述了发生在世界第一个时代的另一场冲突。很久以前，被称为 \"霸主 \"的强大的大恶魔和他们的罗刹和小恶魔的军队统治了Eberron。光明的力量--有些版本的故事说是主宰的九个神，有些说是龙和天人的联盟--最终打败了霸主。但这些恶魔无法被消灭；相反，他们不朽的精华被束缚在开伯尔。无论这个故事的真实细节如何，有一点是真实的：如果霸主们打破他们的束缚，后果将是灾难性的。",
	"Over the course of millennia, numerous civilizations rose only to fall. Giants built mighty kingdoms on the continent of Xen'drik that were devastated by a war with the dragons of Argonnessen. The goblin empire of Dhakaan ruled Khorvaire until its reign was shattered by an invading army of mind flayers, beholders, and the foul creatures that created them. Today these civilizations are known only through the remnants left behind.": "在几千年的时间里，许多文明都在崛起，却又在衰落。巨人在Xen'drik大陆上建立了强大的王国，但在与Argonnessen的龙的战争中遭到破坏。达卡安（Dhakaan）的地精帝国统治着霍尔韦尔，直到它的统治被一支入侵的心灵感应者、持有者和创造他们的肮脏生物的军队所粉碎。今天，这些文明只能通过留下的残余物来了解。",
	"In the modern age, the greatest power was the kingdom of Galifar, which covered most of the continent of Khorvaire. The Five Nations—Aundair, Breland, Karrnath, Thrane, and Cyre—formed the heart of the kingdom. Although each has a unique cultural identity, they share this unified foundation. Families are spread across the Five Nations; the rulers of the Five Nations descend from the Wynarns, the royal bloodline of Galifar. Despite their differences, an Aundairian has more in common with a Thrane than with a Zil gnome or a Lhazaar pirate.": "在现代，最强大的力量是加利法尔王国，它覆盖了霍尔韦尔大陆的大部分地区。五个国家--Aundair、Breland、Karrnath、Thrane和Cyre--构成了这个王国的核心。虽然每个国家都有独特的文化特征，但它们都有这个统一的基础。家庭分布在五国之间；五国的统治者都是加里法尔的皇室血统--怀纳恩的后代。尽管存在差异，但一个昂代尔人与瑟兰人的共同点要比与齐尔地精或拉扎尔海盗的共同点多。",
	"A century ago Galifar collapsed into civil war, and the Five Nations became separate countries at odds with their neighbors. The Last War came to an end after Cyre was destroyed in a cataclysm known as the Mourning. The Five Nations remain divided today, sharing Khorvaire with the new nations established by the Treaty of Thronehold. The remaining Five Nations remain the largest and most powerful countries in Khorvaire.": "一个世纪前，加利法尔陷入内战，五国成为与邻国不和的独立国家。在赛尔在一场被称为 \"哀悼 \"的大灾难中被摧毁后，最后的战争结束了。今天，五国仍然处于分裂状态，与《王权条约》所建立的新国家共享霍尔韦尔。剩下的五国仍然是霍尔韦尔最大和最强大的国家。",
	"The Treaty of Thronehold officially ended the Last War. The treaty recognized the following nations as sovereign states: Aundair, Breland, Darguun, the Eldeen Reaches, Karrnath, the Lhazaar Principalities, the Mror Holds, Q'barra, the Talenta Plains, Thrane, Valenar, and Zilargo. These nations abide by a common set of laws and maintain diplomatic relations. The Demon Wastes and Shadow Marches regions have no unified government. Droaam has declared itself a nation but has yet to be recognized by the treaty nations.": "王权条约》正式结束了最后一次战争。该条约承认以下国家为主权国家。昂代尔（Aundair）、布雷兰德（Breland）、达尔古恩（Darguun）、艾尔迪恩（Eldeen Reaches）、卡尔纳特（Karrnath）、拉扎尔（Lhazaar）公国、姆罗尔（Moror）领地、卡巴拉（Q'barra）、塔伦塔平原（Talenta Plains）、瑟兰、瓦勒纳和齐拉尔戈。这些国家遵守一套共同的法律并保持外交关系。恶魔荒原和阴影牧场地区没有统一的政府。Droaam已经宣布自己是一个国家，但还没有被条约国家承认。",
	"Although Eberron is a vast world with many continents and cultures, your adventures begin in the land of Khorvaire. Here are a few details about everyday life there.": "虽然Eberron是一个拥有许多大陆和文化的广阔世界，但你的冒险却从Khorvaire的土地上开始。这里有一些关于那里日常生活的细节。",
	"In Eberron, languages reflect culture and geography; a dwarf raised in Breland might not know Dwarvish, but a halfling raised in the Mror Holds might. The historical development of languages and cultures also explains the scripts used to write various languages. For example, the Orc language is written using the Goblin script (rather than Dwarvish, as stated in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}), because the orcs of Khorvaire learned writing from the goblins.": "在Eberron，语言反映了文化和地理；一个在Breland长大的矮人可能不知道矮人语，但一个在Moror Holds长大的半身人可能知道。语言和文化的历史发展也解释了用于书写各种语言的文字。例如，半兽人的语言是用地精文字书写的（而不是矮人文字，如{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中所述），因为霍尔韦尔的兽人从地精那里学会了书写。",
	"Common is the language of the Five Nations and the language of trade in Khorvaire, known by most of its people. Goblin was the trade language of the goblin empire of Dhakaan and survives as the primary language in Darguun, Droaam, and the Shadow Marches. Goblin displaced the Orc language; the people of the Shadow Marches typically speak Goblin, and Orc is an exotic language (see the Exotic Languages of Eberron table). Members of all races in Xen'drik speak Giant and use it as their trade language. Infernal is the common tongue of all fiends. Infernal is sometimes called \"Khyber's Speech,\" while Celestial is \"the tongue of Siberys.\"": "通用语是五国的语言，也是霍尔韦尔的贸易语言，为其大多数人所熟知。妖精语是达卡安的妖精帝国的贸易语言，并作为主要语言在达古恩、德罗阿姆和阴影地带生存。妖精语取代了兽人语；阴影地带的人们通常说妖精语，而兽人语是一种外来语言（参见《Eberron外来语言》表）。Xen'drik的所有种族成员都说巨人语，并将其作为他们的贸易语言。地狱语是所有魔族的共同语言。地狱语有时被称为 \"开伯尔之语\"，而天人语是 \"西伯利亚之语\"。",
	"With the DM's approval, you can exchange a language granted by your race for a different language from the Standard Languages of Eberron table. If your halfling was raised in the Mror Holds, you might replace Halfling with Dwarvish to reflect that background. The DM may change the languages assigned to a monster or NPC. An ogre from Droaam likely speaks Goblin instead of Giant.": "经DM批准，你可以将你的种族所赋予的语言换成Eberron标准语言表中的另一种语言。如果你的半身人是在Mror Holds长大的，你可以用矮人语代替半身人，以反映这一背景。DM可以改变分配给某个怪物或NPC的语言。一个来自Droaam的食人魔可能会说哥布林语而不是巨人语。",

	"Most citizens of Khorvaire have a given name followed by a surname. A surname associated with the Common language is usually either a family name or related to an occupation or region of origin.

	"The noble families of Galifar—along with those granted land and titles by one of the sovereigns of the Five Nations—add the prefix ir' to their surname. The name Darro ir'Lain tells you that this individual is a landed noble. The Wynarns were the royal line of Galifar, and the current rulers of Aundair, Breland, and Karrnath are all heirs of the Wynarn bloodline. Thus, Queen Aurala of Aundair is Aurala ir'Wynarn.": "加利法尔的贵族家庭--以及那些被五国君主之一授予土地和头衔的人--在他们的姓氏前加上ir'。Darro ir'Lain这个名字告诉你，这个人是一个有土地的贵族。怀纳恩家族是加利法尔的皇室血统，昂代尔、布雷兰德和卡尔纳特的现任统治者都是怀纳恩血统的继承人。因此，昂代尔的奥拉拉女王就是奥拉拉-伊尔-怀纳恩。",

However, while the designs imprinted on these coins vary based on the source, each of these factions has continued to use the same metals, weights, and denominations set forth in the days of Galifar, maintaining a simple standard for commerce across Khorvaire.": "商人和贵族使用信用证来处理大宗交易，动用Mror Holds的矮人银行的储备。但大多数日常交易都使用贵金属硬币。随着加利法尔王国的崩溃，五国中的每一个国家都开始铸造自己的货币，与Moror的银行家一起。然而，虽然印在这些硬币上的设计因来源而异，但这些派别中的每一个都继续使用加利法尔时代规定的相同金属、重量和面额，为整个霍尔韦尔的商业维持一个简单的标准。",
	"The copper crown (cp) traditionally depicts the crown of Galifar on one face. The crown is the lowest denomination of coin minted under the rule of Galifar, which spawned the saying, \"In Galifar, even the beggars have crowns.\"": "铜冠（cp）传统上是在一面描绘加利法尔的王冠。王冠是加利法尔统治时期铸造的最低面额的硬币，这也催生了一句话：\"在加利法尔，即使是乞丐也有王冠\"。",

	"Eberron is a world in need of heroes. Lingering tensions of war remain. From the fanatics of the Emerald Claw and the mad cults of the Dragon Below to the flesh-warping daelkyr and ancient archfiends, Eberron faces many threats, and few people besides the player characters are able to stop them. The gods are distant and don't directly intervene. The Silver Flame is a divine force of light, but it can act only through mortal champions. The few powerful benevolent NPCs have limitations: the Keeper of the Flame loses her powers if she leaves her citadel. The Great Druid, the spiritual leader of the Eldeen Reaches, is a tree. Most of the powerful people in the world focus on selfish goals. If an angry dragon attacks Sharn, there's no one else to deal with the problem: the fate of the city is in your hands.": "Eberron是一个需要英雄的世界。挥之不去的战争紧张局势依然存在。从翡翠之爪的狂热者和龙下之城的疯狂邪教，到肉体扭曲的daelkyr和古老的大恶魔，Eberron面临着许多威胁，而除了玩家角色之外，很少有人能够阻止他们。诸神是遥远的，不会直接干预。银色火焰是一种神圣的光的力量，但它只能通过凡人的冠军来行动。少数强大的仁慈的NPC也有限制：火焰的守护者如果离开她的城堡就会失去她的力量。大德鲁伊（Great Druid）是Eldeen Reaches的精神领袖，他是一棵树。世界上大多数有权势的人都专注于自私的目标。如果一条愤怒的龙袭击了沙恩，没有其他人可以处理这个问题：城市的命运掌握在你手中。",
	"Consider a dynamic backstory when developing your character and choosing your background, whether you take a background from the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} or the house agent background in {@book chapter 1|ERLW|1} of this book. If you take the soldier background, you might have played a role in events of the last few years. What did you do during the Last War? What was your greatest triumph or defeat? If you're a spy, are you a prized agent or did you disavow your organization after they pushed you too far? Don't think of your character as a set of numbers: even at 1st level, you're remarkable in Eberron.": "在发展你的角色和选择你的背景时，考虑一个动态的背景故事，无论你采取的是本书（%0%）中的背景还是（%1%）中的房屋经纪人背景。如果你采取士兵的背景，你可能在过去几年的事件中扮演了一个角色。你在上次战争中做了什么？你最大的胜利或失败是什么？如果你是一个间谍，你是一个受人尊敬的特工，还是在你的组织把你逼得太紧之后，你放弃了你的组织？不要把你的角色看成是一组数字：即使是一级，你在Eberron也是很了不起的。",
	"What's better than a battle on the deck of an airship? A battle on the deck of an airship that's about to crash! A DM should look for ways to raise the stakes of an Eberron scene, so players feel that every decision matters. This could be driven by the consequences of failure: your actions protect your friends, your house, or your nation. It could involve time: the alarm's been triggered, and you only have 6 rounds before security arrives. Such things can even be incidental. Did you start a fight in an alley behind a bar? Now you notice the drunk ogre sleeping in the shadows. If she wakes up, this could get ugly.": "有什么比飞艇甲板上的战斗更精彩？那就是在即将坠毁的飞艇甲板上的战斗。DM应该寻找方法来提高Eberron场景的赌注，使玩家感到每一个决定都很重要。这可能是由失败的后果驱动的：你的行动会保护你的朋友、你的房子或你的国家。它可能涉及到时间：警报被触发了，在保安到达之前你只有6个回合的时间。这种事情甚至可以是偶然的。你是不是在酒吧后面的小巷里挑起了一场战斗？现在你注意到那个醉醺醺的食人魔在阴影中睡觉。如果她醒了，情况可能会变得很糟糕。",
	"Eberron is rich in villains, from two-bit hoods to continental masterminds. It might be a long time before you're ready to face the sinister leader behind the Order of the Emerald Claw in battle. But part of the flavor of pulp adventure includes recurring villains who closely match the heroes—rivals who advance in power as you do.": "Eberron的反派人物非常多，从二流子到大陆的主谋。在你准备好在战斗中面对翡翠之爪骑士团背后的邪恶领袖之前，可能还需要很长一段时间。但纸浆冒险的部分风味包括反复出现的与英雄密切相关的反派--随着你的力量提升的对手。",
	"To create a compelling villain, the DM and players might develop a villain's backstory together. A DM might ask a player: {@i When you fought in the Last War, Halas Martain served in your unit until he betrayed you. What did he do, exactly?} Likewise, when a pulp villain appears to die, they can devise remarkable escapes from death. Perhaps Halas had a ring that cast an illusion of his death while stabilizing him or cast {@spell feather fall} when he leapt from that tower in Sharn. A DM could engage the players in determining the answer: {@i It's Halas Martain, all right. How do you think he survived your last encounter?} This collaboration can produce a compelling story and a sense of investment in the world.": "为了创造一个令人信服的反派，管理员和玩家可能会一起开发一个反派的背景故事。DM可能会问玩家。{@i When you fought in the Last War, Halas Martain served in your unit until he betrayed you. What did he do, exactly?}同样地，当一个纸醉金迷的反派出现死亡时，他们可以设计出非凡的逃脱死亡的方法。也许Halas有一个戒指，在稳定他的同时投下了死亡的幻觉，或者在他从Sharn的那座塔上跳下时投下（%1%）。管理者可以让玩家参与确定答案。{@i It's Halas Martain, all right.

As you consider a flaw for your character, you can add a little hard-boiled flavor by considering the past: Did you make a tragic mistake, and if so, is it something you can ever undo? Did you hurt or betray someone who now seeks revenge? The Regrets table provides a few examples of missteps that might haunt you.": "玩家角色是了不起的人，但他们并不完美。当你考虑你的角色的缺陷时，你可以通过考虑过去来增加一点硬朗的味道。你是否犯了一个悲惨的错误，如果是的话，你是否能挽回？你是否伤害或背叛了某人，而他现在正在寻求报复？遗憾表提供了一些可能困扰你的失误的例子。",

	"A regret helps shape your personality as an element of your past that plays an ongoing role in your story. But perhaps you have a problem that needs to be resolved right now. Another way to define a character's flaw is to roll on the Debts table.": "遗憾有助于塑造你的个性，作为你过去的一个元素，在你的故事中发挥着持续的作用。但也许你现在就有一个需要解决的问题。另一种定义人物缺陷的方法是在债务表上滚动。",
	"Why would you want to take on a debt? The obligation adds depth to a character and provides a compelling, immediate motive for adventuring—you're not just out to get rich; you need gold to get that bounty off your head. It's also an opportunity to establish an element that can be part of a character moving forward. If you're trying to reclaim a magic item from a pawnshop, you declare that your character once owned that magic item—an heirloom, something you created, or a gift from a mentor—you've just temporarily lost it. If you're trying to raise money to join a secret society, it suggests that membership in this organization may be a part of the story later on.": "你为什么要承担债务？债务增加了角色的深度，并为冒险提供了令人信服的直接动机--你不只是为了发财；你需要金子来把赏金从你头上拿下来。这也是一个机会，可以建立一个可以成为角色前进的一部分的元素。如果你想从当铺取回一件魔法物品，你要声明你的角色曾经拥有这件魔法物品--一件传家宝，你创造的东西，或者导师的礼物--你只是暂时失去了它。如果你想筹钱加入一个秘密组织，这表明加入这个组织可能是以后故事的一部分。",
	"Establishing a debt requires collaboration and approval by both player and DM. Work together to develop the details: Who's blackmailing you? Which secret society are you trying to join?

	"Not every conflict involves a fight between light and darkness. The vast majority of people are driven by simple motives: greed, fear, pride, or ambition.

A leader guiding their nation into war is motivated both by fear of their neighbors and the sincere belief that Khorvaire would be better off under their rule.": "并非每一场冲突都涉及到光明与黑暗之间的斗争。绝大多数人都被简单的动机所驱使：贪婪、恐惧、骄傲或野心。一个人只想在自己的口袋里得到一些金子。另一个人想给姘头留下好印象。一个引导他们的国家进入战争的领导人，既是出于对邻国的恐惧，也是真诚地相信霍尔韦尔在他们的统治下会变得更好。",
	"Primordial forces strive to change or destroy Eberron. But more often, characters encounter misguided patriots, religious extremists, dragonmarked houses looking to wring a few more pieces of gold out of Khorvaire, spies who will do anything to protect their nations, and petty criminals trying to build empires. Eberron holds a place for selfless heroes and truly vile villains, as well as everyone in between.": "原始的力量试图改变或摧毁Eberron。但更多时候，角色们会遇到误入歧途的爱国者、宗教极端分子、希望从霍尔韦尔那里多榨取几块金子的龙纹家族、为保护国家不惜一切代价的间谍，以及试图建立帝国的小罪犯。Eberron为无私的英雄和真正卑鄙的恶棍，以及介于两者之间的每个人提供了一个位置。",
	"In Eberron, it's not always easy to separate the heroes from the villains. Good people can do terrible things, while cruel or heartless people might serve the greater good. An inquisitor might torture innocents in a quest to root out a cult of the Dragon Below; if she's stopped, the cult will survive and flourish. A group of orcs periodically raids a human settlement because the settlers built their village on land sacred to the orcs and are disrupting wards that hold evil at bay. The heroes find a powerful magic weapon in a tomb, but the artifact is the sword of an ancient hobgoblin general, whose descendants want it back. The ways to resolve these problems aren't always simple.": "在Eberron，要区分英雄和恶棍并不容易。好人可以做可怕的事情，而残忍或无情的人则可能为更大的利益服务。一个审问者可能会在寻求根除 \"下龙 \"邪教的过程中折磨无辜者；如果她被阻止了，这个邪教就会生存并发展壮大。一群兽人定期袭击一个人类定居点，因为定居者在兽人的圣地上建造了他们的村庄，并破坏了阻止邪恶的防护措施。英雄们在一座坟墓中发现了一件强大的魔法武器，但这件艺术品是古代妖精将军的剑，他的后人想要回它。解决这些问题的方法并不总是简单的。",

	"In a noir story, things don't necessarily end well. But any adventure carries a risk of death or failure, so what additional factors might be at risk for the characters? They should have something to lose beyond hit points, vulnerabilities not reflected in game statistics: fear of a tarnished reputation, a threat to a friend or lover, a favorite business destroyed or taken over. Character relationships require players to invest in the story and work best when the DM and player collaborate to develop details (the {@book group patrons|ERLW|4} in chapter 1 provide a framework for fleshing out such details).": "在一个黑色的故事中，事情不一定有好结果。但任何冒险都有死亡或失败的风险，那么对人物来说，还有什么额外的因素可能会有风险？除了命中率之外，他们还应该有一些可以失去的东西，即游戏统计中没有反映出来的弱点：害怕名誉受损、朋友或爱人受到威胁、最喜欢的生意被毁或被接管。角色关系需要玩家投入到故事中去，当DM和玩家合作开发细节时，效果最好（第一章中的（%0%）提供了一个充实这些细节的框架）。",
	"A DM who introduces an old buddy who served with the player characters during the war could describe the person and then ask each player to define a connection to them. Present each player with a prompt: {@i Player one, how did Smitty save your life?

	"Two main options provide long-distance travel across land. Major cities in Khorvaire are linked by the lightning rail of House Orien, which allows you to avoid the perils—and tedium—of the roads.

This grueling conflict left deep scars on the land and the people, but there was worse to come. On 20 Olarune 994 YK, the nation of Cyre was consumed in a magical cataclysm now known as the Mourning.

Shock and fear brought the nations to the negotiating table, and the Last War came to an end in 996 YK with the Treaty of Thronehold.": "最后的战争是一场痛苦的斗争，永远改变了霍尔韦尔的形态。那是一个以联盟变化为标志的世纪，多年的僵局与激烈的战斗交织在一起。这场艰苦的冲突给这片土地和人民留下了深深的伤痕，但更糟糕的事情还在后面。在994年奥拉鲁恩20日，赛尔国家在一场被称为 \"哀悼 \"的魔法大灾难中被吞噬。哀悼的原因仍然不明；许多人担心它是由战争魔法的无节制使用造成的。震惊和恐惧将各国带到了谈判桌上，最后的战争在公元996年以《王权条约》结束。",

	"Before the Last War, Galifar laid claim to all Khorvaire. Several new states emerged over the course of the war. In some cases, this was largely a formality; Galifar never had a strong grip on the Lhazaar Principalities or the gnome nation of Zilargo, and they held the Demon Wastes in name only. Other states were born in violence: the elves of Valenar and the goblins of Darguun seized their realms by force. But Aundair yearns to reclaim the Eldeen Reaches, Breland keeps a wary eye on the monstrous kingdom of Droaam, and many mistrust the Valenar elves. Within the Five Nations, anger remains over how the final lines were drawn; for example, Thrane retains control of the ancient Aundairian city of Thaliost, seized during the war.": "在最后一次战争之前，加利法尔对整个霍尔韦尔提出了要求。在战争过程中出现了几个新的国家。在某些情况下，这在很大程度上是一种形式；加利法尔从未对拉扎尔公国或齐拉尔戈的地精国有过强有力的控制，他们只是名义上拥有恶魔荒原。其他国家在暴力中诞生：瓦勒纳的精灵和达尔古恩的地精通过武力夺取了他们的王国。但昂代尔（Aundair）渴望夺回艾尔迪恩河谷（Eldeen Reaches），布雷兰（Breland）对德罗阿姆（Droaam）的畸形王国保持警惕，许多人不信任瓦伦纳（Valenar）的精灵。在五国内部，人们对最后的分界线仍然心存愤怒；例如，瑟兰仍然控制着在战争中被夺取的昂代尔古城--塔利奥斯特。",
	"The borders between nations demonstrate the impact of generations of conflict. Forests and farmlands scorched by fire and magic are still recovering. Ruined cities have yet to be reclaimed, along with shattered villages and abandoned fortresses. These deserted sites now provide shelter for brigands or are haunted by the restless spirits of those who died in anguish.": "国家之间的边界显示了几代人的冲突所带来的影响。被火和魔法烧焦的森林和农田仍在恢复中。被毁坏的城市还没有被收回，还有破碎的村庄和废弃的堡垒。这些荒废的地方现在为强盗提供庇护，或者被那些在痛苦中死去的人的不安的灵魂所困扰。",
	"This damage reached far beyond the front lines. Magic-fueled weapons, aerial cavalry, and guerrilla forces all struck deep within enemy territory, and the cities of Khorvaire suffered. Wherever you go, you might see the scorch marks of fireballs or wreckage from siege weapons. Every nation is working to repair these wounds, but the damage could linger for generations.": "这种损害远远超出了前线。以魔法为燃料的武器、空中骑兵和游击队都在敌人的领土深处进行打击，霍尔韦尔的城市也遭受了损失。无论你走到哪里，你都可能看到火球的焦痕或攻城武器的残骸。每个国家都在努力修复这些伤痕，但损害可能会持续几代人。",

Former nobles now have nothing but rags, and scholars or artists live in alleyways.": "难民生活在每个主要城市，包括成千上万因赛尔的毁灭而产生的流亡者。赛尔人是一个没有祖国的民族，他们在曾经的敌人的土地上寻求庇护和寄托。许多赛伦难民是前士兵，他们在哀伤袭来时正在敌人的领土上作战，或者他们是农民和商人，在他们的国家被吞噬之前逃跑了。昔日的贵族现在除了衣衫褴褛外一无所有，而学者或艺术家则住在巷子里。",
	"Cities and towns still suffer from shortages in the aftermath of the war. Farmlands, workers, and the resources devoted to the war were lost.

Others say that dead-gray mists rose in the capital city of Metrol and spread from there. Within the space of one day, the nation of Cyre had been engulfed in a wall of mist, and anything caught within the mists was horrifically transformed. Over a million Cyrans were killed on the day of Mourning. Those who survived were soldiers fighting in enemy territory, those living on the borders who were able to flee from the advancing mists, and those few who were able to escape the interior through magical means. On 20 Olarune 994 YK, the nation of Cyre ceased to exist.": "关于悼念活动的说法不一。有人说，一道刺眼的光芒吞噬了赛伦路附近的战场。还有人说，死灰色的迷雾在首都梅特罗尔升起，并从那里蔓延开来。在一天的时间里，赛尔国被一堵雾墙吞没了，任何被卷入雾中的东西都被可怕地改变了。在哀悼日当天，超过一百万赛尔人被杀。那些幸存下来的人是在敌方领土上作战的士兵，那些生活在边界的人能够从推进的迷雾中逃离，以及那些少数能够通过魔法手段逃离内部的人。在公元994年奥拉鲁恩20日，赛尔国不复存在。",
	"The Mourning threw Khorvaire into a state of shock. Who could unleash such power? Was this a weapon, and if so, when would those responsible issues their demands? Were the borders of the lingering walls of mist stable, or could they expand at any moment? What was to be done with the Cyran refugees surging into every adjacent nation? Fear of the Mourning ended the war. But all those questions remain unanswered.": "哀悼会使霍尔韦尔陷入了震惊之中。谁能释放出这样的力量？这是一种武器吗？如果是的话，那些负责任的人何时会提出他们的要求？挥之不去的迷雾之墙的边界是否稳定，或者它们随时都可能扩大？该如何处理涌入每一个邻近国家的赛伦难民呢？恐惧的哀伤结束了战争。但所有这些问题仍未得到解答。",
	"Breland opened its borders to refugees, and Prince Oargev serves as de facto ruler in the area now called New Cyre. Despite its grand name, New Cyre is little more than a vast refugee camp. Other refugees scattered across Khorvaire; some are treated with pity, others with suspicion or anger. And fear of the Mourning hangs like a shadow across Khorvaire. Could it happen again? Is this how the world ends?": "布雷兰德向难民开放边界，奥格夫王子在现在被称为新赛尔的地区担任事实上的统治者。尽管新赛尔的名字很宏伟，但它不过是一个巨大的难民营。其他难民分散在霍尔韦尔各地；有些人受到怜悯，有些人受到怀疑或愤怒。而对哀伤的恐惧像阴影一样笼罩着整个Khorvaire。它可能再次发生吗？世界就是这样结束的吗？",
	"A wall of dead-gray mist surrounds the remnants of Cyre. Beyond the mists lies a land twisted by magic, a wound that will not heal. The blasted land is strangely transformed. In some places, the ground has fused into jagged glass. In others, it is cracked and burned. Broken bodies of soldiers from various sides litter the landscape—soldiers whose dead bodies refuse to decompose. The Mournland is a vast open grave.": "一道死灰色的雾墙围绕着赛尔的遗迹。迷雾之外是一片被魔法扭曲的土地，一个无法愈合的伤口。这片被炸毁的土地发生了奇怪的变化。在一些地方，地面已经融合成锯齿状的玻璃。在其他地方，它是裂开和烧毁的。来自不同阵营的士兵的碎尸遍布这片土地--那些尸体拒绝腐烂的士兵。哀牢地是一个巨大的露天坟墓。",
	"In that horrific landscape, vile magical effects linger, and monsters mutate into even more foul and horrible creatures. Magical effects continue to rain upon the land as storms that never dissipate. Stories speak of living spells—war magic that has taken physical form, sentient fireballs and vile cloudkills that endlessly search for new victims. And angry ghosts continue to fight their final battles.": "在那片恐怖的土地上，卑劣的魔法效果挥之不去，怪物们变异成更加肮脏和恐怖的生物。魔法效应像风暴一样持续不断地降临在这片土地上，永不消散。故事中提到了活生生的咒语--具有物理形态的魔法，有生命的火球和卑鄙的云杀，无休止地寻找新的受害者。愤怒的鬼魂继续进行着他们最后的战斗。",
	"The only thing predictable about the Mournland is that nothing is predictable; any sort of monster or horror could lurk within its borders. And yet it also holds the wealth and treasures of an entire nation, along with the secrets of House Cannith and everything else that was left behind. It's dangerous. It's mysterious. But it's also a dungeon the size of a nation, with opportunities for those brave enough to enter the mists.": "哀牢地唯一可以预测的是，没有什么是可以预测的；任何种类的怪物或恐怖都可能潜伏在它的边界内。然而，它还拥有整个国家的财富和宝藏，以及坎尼斯家族的秘密和其他一切遗留下来的东西。它很危险。它是神秘的。但它也是一个相当于一个国家大小的地牢，为那些有勇气进入迷雾的人提供了机会。",
	"In making an Eberron character, think about the impact the Mourning had on you. If you're from Cyre, did you lose all your family and friends? Are there heirlooms lost in the mists that you're determined to regain, or loved ones you hope to someday see again? Do you feel loyalty to your nation and hope to see it restored, or have you burned Cyre out of your heart?": "在制作Eberron角色时，想想哀伤对你的影响。如果你是赛尔人，你是否失去了所有的家人和朋友？是否有遗失在迷雾中的传家宝，而你决心要夺回，或者你希望有一天能再次见到亲人？你是否对你的国家感到忠诚，并希望看到它得到恢复，或者你已经把赛尔城从你的心中烧掉了？",
	"Even if you're not from Cyre, the Mourning may have had a profound impact on you. Are you afraid that the Mourning could consume all of Khorvaire, or do you prefer not to dwell on such things? If you're religious, did the shocking tragedy of the Mourning cause you to question your faith, or did it reinforce it? If you're an artificer or a wizard, are you interested in studying its effects more closely. Might you even hope to unravel its mysteries yourself? Do you see it solely as a tragedy, or do you hope that this awesome power could somehow be harnessed?": "即使你不是来自赛尔，哀悼也可能对你产生了深刻的影响。你是害怕哀伤会吞噬整个霍尔韦尔，还是不愿意纠结于这种事情？如果你有宗教信仰，哀悼会令人震惊的悲剧是导致你质疑你的信仰，还是加强了它？如果你是一个工匠或巫师，你是否有兴趣更仔细地研究它的影响。你甚至可能希望自己揭开它的神秘面纱？你是仅仅把它看作是一场悲剧，还是希望这种可怕的力量能够以某种方式被利用？",
	"Perhaps you were caught in the Mourning and survived the experience, but its effects remain with you. Consider the following aftereffects of your experience:": "也许你被卷入了哀悼中，并在这次经历中幸存下来，但它的影响仍然伴随着你。考虑一下你的经历的以下后遗症。",
	"As a barbarian, you could have been a simple peasant caught in the Mourning. Everyone else in your community was killed, but their spirits were bound to you.

	"As a warlock, your patron could be interested in the Mourning and drive you to learn more about it. Your patron could even be part of the Mourning—perhaps a collective of spirits killed on the Day of Mourning, or a dark and enigmatic power that might have been responsible for this tragedy.

Or do you believe that you siphon power from it and weaken it with your actions?": "作为一个术士，你的守护者可能对哀伤感兴趣，并促使你去了解更多关于它的信息。你的守护者甚至可以是哀悼的一部分--也许是在哀悼日被杀的灵魂的集体，或者是可能对这场悲剧负责的黑暗和神秘的力量。如果你采取后一种方法，你是否觉得通过使用你的术士魔法，你在为哀悼服务？或者你认为你从它那里抽走了力量，用你的行为削弱了它？",

A fragment of the Prophecy might say, \"If the Bear King is slain by a sorrowful assassin in the Shadow of the Mourning, the Crown will fall from his nation.\" The \"Bear King\" could refer to King Boranel of Breland, since the bear is Breland's heraldic beast. The \"Shadow of the Mourning\" could mean that Boranel must be slain in the Mournland, or it could mean that the assassination must occur on the anniversary of the Mourning. This passage doesn't say that Boranel will be assassinated or that the Brelish monarchy will fall; it suggests that if Boranel is assassinated under these conditions, then the monarchy will surely fall.

	"Tens of thousands of years ago, the dragons of Argonnessen established a garrison of dragonborn in what is now Q'barra. These warriors were assigned to protect the region against the influence of the Lords of Dust. Over time they drifted away from their duties, building a nation in eastern Khorvaire and clashing with the goblinoids of the Dhakaani Empire.": "数万年前，阿贡尼森的龙族在现在的Q'barra建立了一支龙裔驻军。这些战士被指派保护该地区免受尘土领主的影响。随着时间的推移，他们偏离了自己的职责，在霍尔韦尔东部建立了一个国家，并与达卡尼帝国的妖精们发生了冲突。",
	"This dragonborn nation came crashing down when one of the ancient fiendish Overlords stirred, unleashing fiends and corrupting many of the dragonborn themselves. Their nation in ruins, the dragonborn retreated to the darkness of Q'barra. They have remained there ever since, guarding against corruption and fighting the evil forces of the Poison Dusk—which is sometimes described as a cult devoted to a dragon, and sometimes as an army gathering in the name of a fiendish Overlord.": "这个龙裔国家在一个古老的恶魔霸主的搅动下轰然倒塌，释放出恶魔并腐蚀了许多龙裔自己。他们的国家成了一片废墟，龙裔们撤退到了黑暗的Q'barra。从那时起，他们一直呆在那里，防止腐败，并与毒黄昏的邪恶势力作斗争--毒黄昏有时被描述为对龙的崇拜，有时被描述为以魔鬼般的霸主之名聚集的军队。",
	"To date the dragonborn have largely ignored the humans of Q'barra, and the few humans who've encountered dragonborn believe they're some exotic type of lizardfolk. If you're a dragonborn, what has caused you to emerge from Q'barra? Are you on a quest to help your people or to oppose the Lords of Dust? Are you driven by wanderlust or curiosity? Did you serve as a mercenary in the Last War? How might your travels tie to the fate of your people?": "迄今为止，龙裔在很大程度上忽视了Q'barra的人类，少数遇到龙裔的人类认为他们是某种外来的蜥蜴人。如果你是龙裔，是什么导致你从Q'barra出现？你是为了帮助你的人民还是为了反对尘土领主？你是被游荡的欲望还是好奇心驱使？你是否在最后一场战争中充当过雇佣兵？你的旅行与你的人民的命运可能有什么联系？",

	"The origin of the dwarves is shrouded in mystery. Some of their legends tell of a great migration that led the ancient dwarves to Khorvaire from \"a land of endless ice.\" Many believe this refers to the arctic lands of the Frostfell, while others claim that the first dwarves must have come from the frozen plane of Risia. Wherever their roots, these migrant dwarves established a mighty nation beneath the surface of Khorvaire.": "矮人的起源被蒙上了一层神秘的面纱。他们的一些传说讲述了一次大迁徙，导致古代矮人从 \"无尽的冰雪之地 \"来到霍尔韦尔。许多人认为这指的是冰霜之城的北极之地，而其他人则声称第一批矮人一定来自里西亚的冰冻平面。无论他们的根在哪里，这些迁徙的矮人在霍尔韦尔的地表下建立了一个强大的国家。",
	"Most dwarven legends, unconcerned with the question of origin, dwell on the mighty artifacts and priceless treasures crafted by ancient deep-dwelling dwarves, and of the bloody wars they waged against the goblin Empire of Dhakaan. Dwarves today cherish the memory of this ancient nation, for all dwarves in Khorvaire are descended from exiles driven from the realm below—which was later destroyed by the daelkyr. Particularly in the Mror Holds, many dwarves cherish the idea of returning to the subterranean reaches and reestablishing their ancient nation, restoring them to a greatness they have all but forgotten.": "大多数矮人的传说并不关心起源的问题，而是停留在古代深居简出的矮人所制作的强大神器和无价之宝，以及他们对达卡安的地精帝国发动的血腥战争。今天的矮人珍惜这个古老国家的记忆，因为霍尔韦尔的所有矮人都是被赶出地下王国的流亡者的后代--这个王国后来被戴尔基尔摧毁。特别是在Moror Holds，许多矮人珍视回到地下世界并重建他们的古老国家的想法，使他们恢复到他们已经完全遗忘的伟大。",
	"The dwarves of the Mror Holds are defined in part by their relationship to the ancient Realm Below. In a desperate effort to rediscover and reclaim the holdings of their old nation, the dwarves have recovered many weapons of war created in the final days of the empire. Some of these weapons were forged by the dwarves to wield against the daelkyr, but others were made by the daelkyr for the use of their minions—strange symbiotic items (some of which appear in {@book chapter 5|ERLW|12}) that use the life force of their hosts to power their magical abilities.": "摩尔大陆的矮人部分是由他们与古老的下层世界的关系决定的。为了重新发现和夺回他们古老国家的财产，矮人找到了许多在帝国最后时期制造的战争武器。其中一些武器是矮人为了对抗达尔凯尔而铸造的，但另一些则是达尔凯尔为他们的奴仆所制造的--奇怪的共生物品（其中一些出现在{@book chapter 5|ERLW|12}中），它们利用宿主的生命力来增强其魔法能力。",
	"Some clans have banned the use of these symbiotic weapons and any exploration of daelkyr magic, notably the prominent Clan Mroranon. Others, particularly Clan Soldorak, have embraced this magic to use against the daelkyr. Defining a relationship to these discoveries can be an important element of your character's background; you might be a Mroranon paladin or ranger dedicated to expunging any trace of daelkyr magic from the Realm Below, or a Soldorak warlock drawing on the magic of Xoriat in pursuit of your own power, as well as glory for your clan.": "一些部族禁止使用这些共生武器和对达尔凯尔魔法的任何探索，特别是著名的莫洛伦部族。其他人，特别是索多拉克氏族，已经接受了这种魔法来对抗达尔凯尔。定义与这些发现的关系可以成为你的角色背景的一个重要元素；你可能是一个致力于将任何daelkyr魔法的痕迹从下层世界中清除的Mroranon圣骑士或游侠，或者是一个为追求自己的力量以及为你的部族争取荣耀而吸取Xoriat魔法的Soldorak术士。",
	"Another important question to consider in playing a Mrorian character is why you have left the Holds. The Leaving the Mror Holds table offers some suggestions that might spark further ideas.": "在扮演Mororian角色时要考虑的另一个重要问题是你为什么要离开Holds。离开Mor's Holds表提供了一些建议，可能会引发进一步的想法。",
	"A feud with a rival clan has gotten out of hand, and it's best that you spend a few decades away from the Holds while things cool down.": "与一个敌对部族的争斗已经失去控制，在事情冷却的时候，你最好离开霍尔兹几十年。",
	"You come from a large family and there's no room for you to shine in your hold, so you hope to make a name for yourself in the wider world.": "你来自一个大家庭，在你的牵制下，没有空间让你发光，所以你希望在更广阔的世界里为自己扬名。",
	"Your clan has arranged your marriage and your future, and you've decided to have a few adventures before you settle down.": "你的宗族已经安排好了你的婚姻和你的未来，你决定在安顿下来之前进行一些冒险。",

	"You want to assemble champions who can help you explore the ancient ruins beneath your ancestral home.": "你想召集能够帮助你探索祖先家园下面的古代遗迹的冠军。",
	"You've rejected your clan's attitude toward daelkyr magic, earning the enmity of powerful dwarves.": "你拒绝了你的部族对daelkyr魔法的态度，赢得了强大矮人的敌意。",
	"You want to understand how the other peoples of Khorvaire—especially the goblins and orcs—have fought the daelkyr.": "你想了解霍尔韦尔的其他民族--尤其是哥布林和兽人--是如何与戴尔克尔作战的。",
	"Dwarves are spread across Khorvaire. Dwarf soldiers and engineers were part of the armies that united the Five Nations, and dwarf masons laid the foundations of the greatest cities of Galifar. Traditionally loyal to family and clan, dwarves who were born outside the Mror Holds tend to transfer their fierce clan loyalty to their new homes—and particularly to the edifices of stonework that symbolize the permanence and stability of those places. A Brelish dwarf might feel a deep, personal connection to the towers of Sharn or the great walls of Wroat; some dwarves love the great Cathedral of the Silver Flame in Thrane more than devout followers of the Silver Flame. Ultimately, the typical dwarf in wider Khorvaire is more patriotic than the average human of the Five Nations, and many dwarves fought for their nations in the Last War, at least for a time.": "矮人分布在整个霍尔韦尔。矮人士兵和工程师是统一五国的军队的一部分，矮人石匠奠定了加利法尔最伟大城市的基础。传统上忠于家庭和部族的矮人，出生在Moror Holds之外的矮人倾向于将他们激烈的部族忠诚度转移到他们的新家--尤其是象征着这些地方的永久性和稳定性的石制品建筑。一个布雷利什矮人可能会对沙恩的塔楼或沃鲁特的大墙感到深深的个人联系；一些矮人比银焰的虔诚追随者更喜欢瑟兰的银焰大教堂。归根结底，大范围的霍尔韦尔的典型矮人比五国的普通人类更爱国，许多矮人在最后的战争中为他们的国家而战，至少有一段时间。",
	"When creating a dwarf character from the Five Nations, consider both your national loyalty and the role your family plays in your life. Do you live near family? What kind of work do your closest family members pursue, and is that reflected in the background you choose? Are you close to your relatives, or have you had a falling out? Did you lose kin in the Last War?": "当创建一个来自五国的矮人角色时，既要考虑你对国家的忠诚度，也要考虑你的家庭在你生活中所扮演的角色。你住在家庭附近吗？你最亲近的家人从事什么样的工作，这是否反映在你选择的背景中？你和你的亲戚关系密切吗，或者你们之间有分歧吗？你在上次战争中失去了亲属吗？",
	"The Mark of Warding appears on dwarves of House Kundarak, which had its origins as one of the clans of the Mror Holds. Kundarak dwarves live across Khorvaire while maintaining close ties to the Mror Holds and their loyalty to the house over any particular nation.": "守护印记出现在昆达拉克家族的矮人身上，该家族起源于莫洛霍尔的一个部族。昆达拉克矮人生活在霍尔韦尔各地，同时与莫尔霍尔家族保持着密切的联系，他们对家族的忠诚度高于任何特定国家。",
	"In addition to providing all manner of security, House Kundarak dominates Khorvaire's banking industry. As a dragonmarked house, it is obliged to remain neutral in the politics of all nations, including its homeland. As a result, Clan Kundarak is no longer represented on the Iron Council that rules the Mror Holds. However, it wields an influence over the other clans that reflects its wealth and its status in the world beyond the Holds, and the voice of Kundarak members arguing against the use of daelkyr magic carries significant weight.": "除了提供各种形式的安全保障外，昆达拉克家族还主导着霍尔韦尔的银行业。作为一个有龙纹的家族，它有义务在所有国家的政治中保持中立，包括它的祖国。因此，昆达拉克家族在统治摩尔大陆的铁议会中不再有代表。然而，它对其他部族的影响反映了它的财富和它在霍尔兹以外的世界的地位，昆达拉克成员反对使用达尔凯尔魔法的声音具有重要的影响力。",
	"Put up your swords and talk of peace, or hide behind your walls of stone. When the host of Valenar thunders forth, neither will save you.": "举起你们的剑，谈论和平，或者躲在你们的石墙后面。当瓦勒纳的大军来袭时，两者都无法拯救你们。",
	"Tens of thousands of years ago, the elves of the distant continent of Xen'drik rose up against the giants who ruled over them. This rebellion is the defining event in elf history. As the ancient war progressed, the magebreeders of the giants bound magic into the elves who remained loyal to them, forming the drow—assassins bred to prey on their other kin. Ultimately, the elves fled from Xen'drik and settled the island nation of Aerenal, where they split into two distinct cultures: the introspective Aereni and the warlike Tairnadal. Thus, a war nearly forty thousand years ago established the pattern of how elves live today.": "数万年前，遥远的Xen'drik大陆的精灵们奋起反抗统治他们的巨人。这次叛乱是精灵历史上的决定性事件。随着古代战争的进行，巨人的魔法师们将魔法束缚在那些忠于他们的精灵身上，形成了专门猎杀其他亲属的乌鸦刺客。最终，精灵们逃离了Xen'drik，定居在Aerenal岛国，在那里他们分裂成两种不同的文化：内向的Aereni和好战的Tairnadal。因此，近四万年前的一场战争奠定了今天精灵们的生活模式。",
	"Neither the Aereni nor the Tairnadal (which include the elves of Valenar) have much interest in human activities, but small numbers of elves have immigrated to Khorvaire over the centuries and have more or less integrated with the cultures of the Five Nations. The drow, though, are virtually unknown on Khorvaire.": "Aereni和Tairnadal（包括Valenar的精灵）都对人类的活动没有太大的兴趣，但几个世纪以来，有少量的精灵移民到了Khorvaire，并或多或少地融入了五国的文化。不过，克罗人在霍尔韦尔几乎无人知晓。",
	"As a whole, elves are driven by tradition and respect for the past. Where humans value innovation, elves strive to master and perfect the techniques of their ancestors over the course of studies lasting centuries. Elf society has changed little over the last five thousand years, while Khorvaire is constantly evolving. Whatever the origin of your elf character, consider your relationship with the past: Do you value the traditions of your ancestors? Or do you fear that your people are too mired in the past, and need to find a way to adapt and move forward?": "作为一个整体，精灵们被传统和对过去的尊重所驱动。人类重视创新，而精灵则努力掌握和完善他们祖先的技术，并进行持续几个世纪的研究。在过去的五千年里，精灵社会没有什么变化，而霍尔韦尔则在不断地发展。无论你的精灵角色的起源是什么，请考虑你与过去的关系。你是否重视你祖先的传统？或者你担心你的人民过于沉溺于过去，而需要找到一种适应和前进的方法？",
	"For thousands of years, the island nation of Aerenal has been ruled and protected by the godlike power of the Undying Court, a council of undead high elves. The greatest heroes of the Aereni join the Undying Court after death, joining their heroic ancestors in immortality.": "几千年来，艾瑞纳岛国一直被不死阁的神力所统治和保护，不死阁是由不死的高等精灵组成的议会。艾瑞尼人最伟大的英雄在死后加入不死阁，与他们的英雄祖先一起永生。",
	"The Aereni are isolationists who have little interest in the world beyond their island. The Five Nations are a place of chaos and war, so why would any sensible elf venture into that madness? As you make an Aereni elf character, decide what has caused you to leave your island home and the protection of the Undying Court in order to wander the world. Are you in search of a power that could earn you your place in the Undying Court? Have you been given a quest by one of your own deathless ancestors? Or are you an exile, banished from your homeland for some crime against your people's rulers?": "艾瑞尼人是孤立主义者，对他们岛屿以外的世界没有什么兴趣。五国是一个充满混乱和战争的地方，那么为什么任何明智的精灵都要冒险进入那个疯狂的世界呢？当你塑造一个艾瑞尼精灵的角色时，请决定是什么原因导致你离开你的岛屿家园和不死阁的保护，以便在世界范围内游荡。你是否在寻找一种可以让你在不朽之庭获得地位的力量？你是否被你自己的不死鸟祖先之一赋予了任务？或者你是一个流亡者，因为对你的人民统治者犯下的一些罪行而被放逐出你的家园？",
	"Consider your character's personal and family history. What is your family known for, and how can you prove yourself to be a master of these skills? Do you have ancestors in the Undying Court, and if so, what's your relationship with them? Do you find it challenging to deal with the short-lived races, or are you patient with them?": "考虑你的角色的个人和家庭历史。你的家族以什么著称，你怎样才能证明自己是这些技能的主人？你是否有祖先在不死阁，如果有，你与他们的关系如何？你觉得与短命的种族打交道有挑战性吗，还是你对他们有耐心？",
	"Tairnadal elves dedicate themselves to the arts of war. The greatest heroes of the Tairnadal's many wars—against giants, dragons, and the champions of Dhakaan—live on after death, becoming the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal. Upon reaching adulthood, a Tairnadal elf forms a bond with one of these ancestors and strives to follow in the footsteps of this ancestor, living as the patron did. In this way, the champion comes to embody their ancestor, allowing the dead to live on.": "泰尔纳达尔精灵将自己奉献给了战争艺术。泰尔纳达尔众多战争中最伟大的英雄--对抗巨人、龙和达卡安的冠军--在死后仍然活着，成为泰尔纳达尔的守护神。成年后，泰尔纳达尔精灵会与这些祖先之一建立联系，并努力追随这位祖先的脚步，像守护者一样生活。通过这种方式，冠军来体现他们的祖先，让死者继续生存下去。",
	"The Tairnadal have three distinct lines: the Draleus Tairn, the Silaes Tairn, and the Valaes Tairn. All three lines roam the northern plains of Aerenal, having left the forest long ago, but the Valaes Tairn now reside mostly in Valenar, being the Tairnadal most often encountered in Khorvaire. Despite sharing a homeland with the Aereni, the Tairnadal have distinct religious traditions, revering their patron ancestors rather than the Undying Court.": "泰尔纳达尔人有三个不同的血统：德拉雷斯-泰尔纳、西拉斯-泰尔纳和瓦拉斯-泰尔纳。这三个系都在艾瑞纳北部平原游荡，很久以前就离开了森林，但瓦莱斯-泰恩现在主要居住在瓦勒纳，是在霍尔韦尔最经常遇到的泰恩达人。尽管与艾瑞尼人同属一个家园，但泰尔纳达尔人有独特的宗教传统，他们敬仰自己的守护神祖先，而不是不朽的法庭。",
	"In creating a Tairnadal character, including a Valenar elf, think about your patron ancestor. Most Tairnadal pursue the same class as their patron, so if your character is a wizard, your ancestor was likely a legendary archmage. Was your ancestor a famous blademaster, a stealthy hunter, or a war chanter? Were they chivalrous or merciless? Bold or clever? Whatever their path, it is your duty to follow their example. Is this something you proudly embrace, or do you resist it? Do you know another elf with the same patron ancestor, and what's your relationship to that character? Do you know an elf whose patron ancestor was a bitter rival of yours?": "在创建泰尔纳达尔角色时，包括瓦伦纳精灵，要考虑到你的守护者祖先。大多数泰尔纳达尔人追求的是与他们的守护者相同的等级，所以如果你的角色是一个巫师，你的祖先很可能是一个传奇的大法师。你的祖先是著名的爆破师、隐秘的猎人，还是战神？他们是侠义的还是无情的？大胆还是聪明？无论他们的道路如何，你都有责任以他们为榜样。这是你自豪地接受的东西，还是你抵制的东西？你是否认识另一个有相同守护者祖先的精灵，你和那个人物有什么关系？你是否知道一个精灵的守护者祖先是你的一个劲敌？",
	"Also consider why you are traveling with a group of player characters (who are presumably not also members of your war band) instead of serving with the Tairnadal. Do you experience visions of your patron ancestor driving you on a particular course? Are you pursuing an epic quest that mirrors your ancestor's legendary deeds? Are you seeking vengeance for the death of a friend or ally? Or have you turned away from your people, either by choice or because of the actions of a rival?": "还要考虑为什么你要和一群玩家角色（他们应该不是你的战队成员）一起旅行，而不是为泰尔纳达尔人服务。你是否经历过你的守护神祖先的幻觉，驱使你走上一条特殊的道路？你是否在追寻一个反映你祖先传奇事迹的史诗般的任务？你是否在为朋友或盟友的死亡寻求复仇？或者你已经远离了你的人民，无论是出于选择还是因为对手的行为？",

	"Throughout history, elves have occasionally migrated to live among the other peoples of Khorvaire. On rare occasions, entire families have relocated (as House Phiarlan did, almost three thousand years ago), but more often wanderers and exiles have come to Khorvaire and made their way there. Many of the finest wizards and most renowned artisans in the Five Nations are high elves. Wood elves are found among the rangers and druids of the Eldeen Reaches and stalking the darkest alleys of Sharn.": "纵观历史，精灵们偶尔会迁移到Khorvaire的其他民族中生活。在极少数情况下，整个家族都会搬迁（就像皮亚伦家族在近三千年前所做的那样），但更多的时候，流浪者和流亡者会来到霍尔韦尔，并在那里发展。五国中许多最好的巫师和最著名的工匠都是高等精灵。在Eldeen Reaches的游侠和德鲁伊中可以找到木精灵，在Sharn的最黑暗的小巷中也可以找到木精灵。",
	"As an elf born and raised in Khorvaire, your character has grown up among the shorter-lived races. You might not be as concerned with history and tradition as the Aereni and Tairnadal; you could even live your life entirely in the moment, with no care for your family or your legacy. Or you could be fascinated by the history and traditions of your ancestors and try to relearn the ways your family has forgotten.": "作为一个在霍尔韦尔出生和长大的精灵，你的角色在寿命较短的种族中成长起来。你可能不像Aereni和Tairnadal那样关注历史和传统；你甚至可以完全活在当下，不关心你的家庭或你的遗产。或者你可以对你祖先的历史和传统着迷，并试图重新学习你的家族所遗忘的方式。",
	"Consider also whether you've outlived human friends and how that might affect you. Did you know the parents or grandparents of another member of your party? Are you trying to repay a debt or fulfill a promise to that long-dead friend, or are you trying to recapture some spark of the friendship you felt years ago? Do you remember a time before the Last War? Did you fight in the war?": "还要考虑你是否已经超过了人类的朋友，这可能会对你产生什么影响。你是否认识你党内另一位成员的父母或祖父母？你是想向那位早已去世的朋友偿还债务或履行承诺，还是想重拾多年前的友谊的一些火花？你还记得最后一次战争之前的一个时期吗？你在战争中战斗过吗？",
	"Long ago on the continent of Xen'drik, the first drow fought beside the giants against the other elves. Tens of thousands of years have passed, and drow and other elves remember each other only as figures in their legends. The Undying Court and the patron ancestors of the Tairnadal remember the drow, but they have little occasion to teach their living descendants about these shadows of the distant past.": "很久以前，在Xen'drik大陆上，第一批乌鸦与巨人一起战斗，对抗其他精灵。几万年过去了，乌鸦和其他精灵都只记得对方是他们传说中的人物。不朽的法庭和泰尔纳达尔的祖先记得乌鸦，但他们很少有机会向他们活着的后代传授这些遥远的过去的影子。",
	"When the elves fled to Aerenal, the drow remained on Xen'drik as subjects of the giants, and they were caught in the collapse of giant civilization. Today they linger on Xen'drik and have set their own course, free of the giants' malevolent influence.": "当精灵们逃到阿伦纳时，乌鸦作为巨人的臣民留在了Xen'drik，他们被卷入了巨人文明的崩溃之中。今天，他们在Xen'drik徘徊，并确定了自己的方向，摆脱了巨人的恶意影响。",
	"Three distinct drow cultures formed after the fall of the giants. The most numerous are the Vulkoori, hunters dedicated to a scorpion god called Vulkoor. They hunt giants and other dangers in their lands. Led by powerful druids and wizards, the Sulatar cling to traditions of elemental shaping that date back to the Age of Giants. They live in a handful of obsidian cities across Xen'drik, and believe that they are destined to cleanse the world in a fiery apocalypse. Finally, the Umbragen are descended from drow who fled into the depths of the earth when the giant civilization fell. They wield sophisticated magic in their unceasing battles against the daelkyr and the other aberrations of the underworld.": "巨人陨落后形成了三种不同的鸦人文化。数量最多的是武库里（Vulkoori），他们是献给一个叫武库里的蝎子神的猎人。他们在自己的土地上猎杀巨人和其他危险品。在强大的德鲁伊和巫师的领导下，苏拉塔人坚持着可追溯到巨人时代的元素塑造传统。他们生活在整个Xen'drik的少数几个黑曜石城市中，并相信他们注定要在一场火热的天启中净化世界。最后，乌姆拉根（Umbragen）是在巨人文明衰落时逃入地球深处的乌鸦的后代。他们在与达尔凯尔（daelkyr）和其他地下世界的反常者进行的不间断战斗中挥舞着复杂的魔法。",
	"When creating a drow character, think about how you came to Khorvaire. Are you a Vulkoori hunter who accompanied an expedition home to Khorvaire, now seeking your way in this strange new world? Are you an Umbragen seeking powers that can help your people in their endless war? Or are you a Sulatar pursuing a personal path to glory?": "当创建一个乌鸦角色时，想想你是如何来到Khorvaire的。你是一个随同远征队回到Khorvaire的Vulkoori猎人，现在在这个陌生的新世界中寻找自己的道路？你是一个在无尽的战争中寻求能够帮助你的人民的力量的Umbragen人吗？或者你是一个追求个人荣耀之路的苏拉塔人？",
	"How do you react to meeting members of other elven cultures during your journeys? You might quickly recognize that most bear little resemblance to the terrors described in your people's legends, or you might have an almost instinctive reaction of distrust. You might have overcome your initial prejudices by the time the campaign begins, or perhaps you're working to build trust with another elf member of your adventuring party.": "在你的旅途中遇到其他精灵文化的成员，你会有什么反应？你可能很快就认识到大多数人与你的民族传说中描述的恐怖没有什么相似之处，或者你可能有一种几乎本能的不信任反应。在活动开始时，你可能已经克服了你最初的偏见，或者你正在努力与你的冒险队伍中的另一个精灵成员建立信任。",
	"The Mark of Shadow first appeared among the elves of the Phiarlan line, and the house quickly turned the mark's powers of shadow and illusion into an economic dynasty. The suspicion of their kin drove them from Aerenal to Khorvaire, and the house splintered during the Last War, giving rise to House Thuranni. The two houses of shadow control the business of espionage throughout Khorvaire, but they also operate more legitimate ventures related to art and entertainment.": "阴影印记首次出现在皮亚伦系的精灵中，该家族很快将印记的阴影和幻觉的力量转化为一个经济王朝。对他们亲属的怀疑将他们从艾瑞纳赶到了霍尔韦尔，在最后的战争中，这个家族分裂了，产生了瑟兰尼家族。这两个影子家族控制着整个霍尔韦尔的间谍业务，但他们也经营着与艺术和娱乐有关的更合法的企业。",
	"Phiarlan blood still runs among some of the Aereni elves, and the Mark of Shadow appears once or twice in each elven generation. Elves bearing this mark are always inducted into the elite force of the Cairdal Blades—an espionage agency in the service of Aerenal's Sibling Kings (see {@book chapter 2|ERLW|6|Aerenal}).": "皮亚伦的血统仍然流淌在一些Aereni精灵中，影子的印记在每一代精灵中出现一到两次。带着这个印记的精灵总是被纳入凯尔达尔之刃的精英部队--一个为Aerenal的兄弟姐妹国王服务的间谍机构（见（%0%））。",
	"Five words can defeat a thousand swords.": "五个字可以打败一千把剑。",
	"The average gnome has a love of knowledge that borders on obsession, a curiosity that admits no limits, and a vast collection of potentially useful information on every personal acquaintance. Most gnomes detest physical violence and prefer to solve their problems with words—whether that's a bard's eloquent persuasion, a wizard's words of power, or a rogue's careful threat. They give an initial impression as friendly busybodies, always ready to lend a hand or share a story, while asking questions that tend toward the slightly-too-personal. Often, though, a cheerful and amiable gnome is methodically adding to a mental storehouse of knowledge that might one day provide important leverage.": "普通地精对知识的热爱近乎痴迷，好奇心不受限制，并在每个人的熟人身上收集了大量潜在的有用信息。大多数地精厌恶肉体暴力，更喜欢用语言解决问题--无论是吟游诗人的雄辩说服，还是巫师的力量之语，或是流氓的谨慎威胁。他们给人的最初印象是友好的大忙人，总是准备伸出援手或分享故事，同时问一些倾向于稍微私人化的问题。不过，通常情况下，一个开朗和友好的地精正在有条不紊地增加一个知识的精神仓库，有一天可能会提供重要的筹码。",
	"To say that every Zil gnome is a ruthless schemer would be a hurtful exaggeration. Intrigue is the favorite pastime of most Zil, though. Every gnome child of Zilargo is taught to manipulate and deceive, and by the time they reach adulthood most have been involved in dozens of schemes and feuds, some of which persist well into adulthood. Even a gnome with a good heart and noble goals—of which there are many—often still prefers to use trickery and cunning rather than the unreliable tools of honesty or brute force.": "如果说每个Zil地精都是一个无情的阴谋家，那将是一种伤害性的夸大。不过，阴谋诡计是大多数齐尔人最喜欢的消遣方式。每一个Zilargo的地精孩子都被教导如何操纵和欺骗，当他们成年时，大多数人已经参与了几十个计划和争斗，其中一些一直持续到成年。即使是心地善良、目标高尚的地精--这类人很多--往往还是喜欢使用诡计和狡猾，而不是诚实或蛮力这些不可靠的工具。",
	"Most Zil gnomes belong to the forest gnome subrace. Their natural talent for illusion aids them in trickery and entertaining, and they often use small animals as messengers and guides.": "大多数齐尔侏儒属于森林侏儒亚种。他们在幻觉方面的天赋帮助他们进行欺骗和娱乐，他们经常使用小动物作为信使和向导。",

Or you could be a sage gathering information for the Library of Korranberg or an investigator sending stories of your adventures back to the {@i Korranberg Chronicle}. Family is important to the Zil, and you could be pursuing your family's interests. You could even be working for the mysterious Trust, the conspiracy behind the Triumvirate's throne that quietly maintains order in Zilargo. If you are working for the Trust, you could have a specific mission, but you could also be a sleeper agent—gathering information and allies until you're activated and you are put to your intended use.": "此外，考虑你与Zilargo的关系：你为什么离开，以及你与它还有什么联系？你的计划可以为你的离开提供一个很好的理由。或者你可以是一个为科兰伯格图书馆收集信息的圣人，或者是一个将你的冒险故事送回（%0%）的调查员。家庭对齐尔人很重要，你可以追求你家庭的利益。你甚至可以为神秘的托拉斯工作，这是三巨头王位背后的阴谋，悄悄地维持着齐乐国的秩序。如果你为信托会工作，你可能有一个特定的任务，但你也可能是一个潜伏的特工--收集信息和盟友，直到你被激活，你被投入你的预期用途。",
	"Zil society is divided into major houses, each of which is composed of multiple families. Each gnome carries the name of a house and of a family in addition to a personal name. For example, Alina Lorridan Lyrris and Tallian Talius Lyrris are members of different families (Lorridan and Talius) within House Lyrris. Gnome names are long and lyrical; a Zil proverb claims \"the sweetest song is the name of a friend.\" Personal and clan names are usually at least three syllables long, and there is a strong tradition of alliteration.": "Zil社会被划分为主要的家族，每个家族都由多个家庭组成。每个地精除了个人的名字外，还带有一个家族的名字和一个家庭的名字。例如，阿琳娜-洛里丹-莱里斯和塔利安-塔利厄斯-莱里斯是莱里斯家族中不同家族（洛里丹和塔利厄斯）的成员。地精的名字很长，也很抒情；Zil的一句谚语称 \"最甜美的歌是朋友的名字\"。个人和氏族的名字通常至少有三个音节，而且有强烈的典故传统。",
	"As they have for countless generations, insatiable curiosity and endless opportunity draw gnomes from Zilargo into the wider lands of Khorvaire. Most of these dispersed gnomes find new homes and integrate easily into local cultures. Gnomes can be found in any walk of life, whether they be as merchants, magewrights, scholars, or scoundrels. While the gnomes of the Five Nations aren't as inherently devious as their Zil cousins, they share the Zil emphasis on the importance of family.": "正如他们无数代以来所做的那样，永不满足的好奇心和无穷无尽的机会将地精从Zilargo吸引到更广阔的Khorvaire土地。这些分散的地精大多找到了新的家园，并轻易地融入了当地文化。地精可以在任何生活领域被发现，无论是商人、魔法师、学者还是恶棍。虽然五国的地精并不像他们的齐尔表亲那样天生就很狡猾，但他们与齐尔一样强调家庭的重要性。",
	"As a gnome character from the Five Nations, you might have a network of connections to the community your grew up in, likely built on the exchange of information. Alternatively, you might seek your own path in life, avoiding the intrigues your cousins adore.": "作为一个来自五国的地精角色，你可能有一个与你长大的社区的联系网络，可能是建立在信息交流的基础上。或者，你可能会在生活中寻求自己的道路，避开你的表亲们所崇拜的阴谋。",
	"The Mark of Scribing appears among the gnomes of House Sivis. The gnomes of this house were among the first of their kind to leave Zilargo and live in human lands. They love bureaucracy and intrigue as much as the gnomes of their homeland, but they have carefully cultivated a reputation for impartiality and secrecy, since their services rely on trust.": "划线的标记出现在西维斯家族的地精中。这个家族的地精是最早离开兹拉尔戈并生活在人类土地上的同类之一。他们和故乡的地精一样喜欢官僚主义和阴谋诡计，但他们精心培养了公正和保密的声誉，因为他们的服务依赖于信任。",

Today there are four primary goblinoid cultures in Khorvaire.": "妖精物种--妖精、地精和虫熊--曾经是霍尔韦尔的主导文明，妖精帝国达卡安统治了这片大陆数千年之久。它被与达尔凯尔（daelkyr）及其反常军队的长期冲突所削弱；尽管达尔凯尔被打败了，但疯狂的种子在帝国中生根发芽并将其撕裂。今天，在霍尔韦尔有四种主要的地精文化。",
	"Goblins dwell in most of the major cities of the Five Nations. When humans first came to Khorvaire, they enslaved many goblins and built their cities on the foundations of Dhakaani ruins.

	"The Ghaal'dar tribes arose from the remnants of the Dhakaani Empire. Hobgoblins are the leaders of the Ghaal'dar, enforcing their will on their goblin and bugbear peers. The history of the Ghaal'dar is filled with strife; when they weren't fighting Galifar or Zilargo, the tribes usually turned on one another. This came to an end with the Last War. House Deneith hired Ghaal'dar mercenaries, and this gave focus to the divided tribes. A brilliant hobgoblin, Haruuc, united the Ghaal'dar, and under his leadership they seized control of what is now Darguun (see {@book chapter 2|ERLW|5}). The aging Lhesh Haruuc remains as the ruler of Darguun, and many fear that his death could throw the region into chaos.": "Ghaal'dar部落是从达卡尼帝国的残余中产生的。霍布林是Ghaal'dar的领袖，将他们的意志强加给他们的地精和虫族同胞。Ghaal'dar的历史充满了纷争；当他们不与加利法尔或齐拉尔戈作战时，各部落通常会相互攻伐。这在最后一次战争中结束了。迪尼斯家族雇佣了盖尔达尔的雇佣兵，这让分裂的部落有了焦点。一个聪明的妖精，哈鲁克，团结了Ghaal'dar，在他的领导下，他们夺取了对现在的Darguun的控制权（见（%0%））。年迈的莱什-哈鲁克仍然是达尔昆的统治者，许多人担心他的死亡会使该地区陷入混乱。",

	"The Marguul bugbears threw off the yoke of the Ghaal'dar long ago, seizing territory in the Seawall Mountains in the south of Darguun.

	"As a Marguul bugbear, you are savage and proud of it. The Marguul worship the Mockery and believe in victory by any means necessary: there is no such thing as honor on the battlefield. It's certainly an unusual choice for a player character, but if you've taken a liking to a particular group of the small folk, you could be a powerful ally.": "作为玛古尔虫族，你是野蛮的，并以此为荣。马古尔人崇拜嘲讽，相信不择手段的胜利：在战场上没有所谓的荣誉。对于一个玩家角色来说，这当然是一个不寻常的选择，但如果你对某一特定的小民群体有好感，你就可以成为一个强大的盟友。",
	"Though the Dhakaani Empire defeated the alien daelkyr, the war left seeds of corruption strewn throughout the empire. As Dhakaan began to fall, a number of generals and governors gathered their forces and retreated into shelters deep within the earth, determined to preserve their civilization until the Empire could finally be restored. After thousands of years, their descendants have finally emerged, competing among themselves to determine which leader deserves the imperial crown. Once this is settled, they will turn to the conquest of Darguun and Khorvaire.": "虽然达卡尼帝国打败了外星的达尔基尔，但战争留下了腐败的种子，散落在整个帝国。当达卡尼开始衰落时，一些将军和总督聚集了他们的力量，并撤退到地球深处的庇护所，决心保护他们的文明，直到帝国最终能够恢复。几千年后，他们的后裔终于出现了，他们相互竞争，以确定哪位领导人值得拥有帝国的王冠。一旦解决了这个问题，他们将转向征服达尔古恩和霍尔韦尔。",
	"The Dhakaani are far fewer in number than the Ghaal'dar; they had to carefully limit their population in the underground vaults they've dwelled in for the past age. However, they have held onto the martial discipline and techniques that allowed their ancestors to dominate the continent.

Bugbears cultivate a focused battle rage and are typically barbarians. Goblins are largely artisans and laborers, but exceptional goblins join the {@i khesh'dar} (\"silent folk\"), learning the skills of rogues, monks, or rangers.

	"The halflings of Eberron originate from eastern Khorvaire, and many nomadic tribes of halflings still travel the Talenta Plains. The appearance of dragonmarks among the halflings spurred their slow migration across Khorvaire, spreading their services of healing and hospitality along with the migration of the earliest humans across the continent. Now they are found in every part of Khorvaire, putting their distinctive talents to use.": "Eberron的半身人起源于Khorvaire东部，许多半身人的游牧部落仍然在Talenta平原旅行。龙纹在半身人中的出现刺激了他们在Khorvaire的缓慢迁移，随着最早的人类在大陆上的迁移，他们的治疗和款待服务也随之传播开来。现在，他们被发现在Khorvaire的每一个地方，把他们独特的才能用在这里。",

	"The halflings who migrated across Khorvaire in the company of humans ended up looking very human in dress, manners, and customs. Their cousins who remain in the Talenta Plains could hardly appear more different. In their homeland, halflings are nomads who ride domesticated dinosaurs across the wide plains.

	"As you make a Talenta halfling character, give some thought to why your character left the open plains. Perhaps you served as a mercenary scout in the Last War, and you've remained with the comrades you met in the conflict. Maybe your tribe was wiped out by a foreign enemy, spurring you to travel the wider world in search of information and revenge. You might be guided by the spirits, who send you whispers and visions that lead you on your adventures. You could be an official envoy of your tribe seeking allies in the world, or simply sent to learn more about the lands beyond the plains.": "当你制作一个塔伦塔半身人角色时，请考虑一下你的角色为什么要离开开阔的平原。也许你在最后一次战争中担任了雇佣兵侦察员，你一直和你在冲突中遇到的战友在一起。也许你的部落被外敌消灭了，刺激你到更广阔的世界去寻找信息和复仇。你可能受到神灵的指引，他们向你发出低语和幻觉，引导你进行冒险。你可能是你的部落的官方特使，在世界范围内寻找盟友，或者只是被派去了解平原以外的土地。",
	"Also, consider your relationship to the dinosaurs that play a central role in the life of the Talenta halflings. You might flavor your spells and class features as dinosaur-related: you could have a clawfoot companion, take on a fastieth form, name your combat styles and maneuvers after dinosaur attacks, or take inspiration from a glidewing (pteranodon) totem spirit. Or you could simply wear a dinosaur mask (as many Talenta halflings do), adorn yourself with claws and teeth from past dinosaur companions, or adopt dinosaur-like mannerisms. Wherever you travel, your connection to the dinosaurs of your home remains strong.": "另外，考虑你与恐龙的关系，恐龙在塔伦塔半身人的生活中起着核心作用。你可以将你的法术和等级特征描绘成与恐龙有关：你可以有一个爪足同伴，拥有一个快活的形态，以恐龙的攻击方式命名你的战斗方式和动作，或者从滑翔翼（翼龙）图腾精神中获得灵感。或者你可以简单地戴上恐龙面具（就像许多塔伦塔半身人所做的那样），用过去的恐龙伙伴的爪子和牙齿来装饰自己，或者采取类似恐龙的举止。无论你在哪里旅行，你与你家乡的恐龙的联系仍然很紧密。",

Of course, these same talents prove equally useful for burglars, grifters, and other criminals.": "敏捷而迷人，许多半身人把他们的天赋作为吟游诗人、大律师、商人和政治家在整个Khorvaire使用。当然，这些天赋对小偷、骗子和其他罪犯也同样有用。",
	"Of particular note is the halfling-run criminal enterprise of the Boromar Clan, the most powerful crime syndicate in Breland. The Boromars are based in Sharn, but their influence reaches across the nation and even to the distant city of Stormreach. If you decide to play a halfling rogue, or a character with a criminal or charlatan background, consider (with your DM) whether you have a connection to the Boromar Clan. You could be a freelance operative who occasionally gets jobs from a Boromar underboss. You might have a cousin in the syndicate, who occasionally pulls you in to criminal affairs. Or you could even be the reluctant heir of a Boromar leader; perhaps you've gone on the run rather than take your appointed place in the criminal empire, but your past may yet catch up with you. You could also be the point of contact who has made the Boromar Clan your party's group patron, as described later in this chapter.": "特别值得注意的是半身人经营的犯罪企业波洛玛家族，这是布雷兰最强大的犯罪集团。波罗玛家族的总部设在沙恩，但他们的影响力遍及全国，甚至延伸到遥远的风暴城。如果你决定扮演一个半身人流氓，或者一个有犯罪或江湖背景的角色，请考虑（与你的管理员一起）你是否与波洛玛尔家族有联系。你可以是一个自由职业者，偶尔会从波洛马族的老板那里得到工作。你可能有一个表弟在集团里，他偶尔会把你拉到犯罪事务中去。或者你甚至可能是一个Boromar领袖的不情愿的继承人；也许你已经逃跑了，而不是在犯罪帝国中占据你指定的位置，但你的过去可能还会追上你。你也可以是让波洛马氏族成为你的团体赞助人的联络人，如本章后面所述。",
	"Two dragonmarks appear among the halflings of Khorvaire, the Mark of Healing in House Jorasco and House Ghallanda's Mark of Hospitality. Both marks are ancient, first manifesting among the halflings about the same time that the elves of Aerenal received their first marks—centuries before the arrival of humans on Khorvaire. Sometimes halflings of House Ghallanda joke that their mark prepared them for the arrival of humans by allowing them to make their new guests comfortable in Khorvaire. There's actually some truth in the humor: the services provided by both halfling houses helped enable the spread of humanity across the continent.": "有两个龙纹出现在霍尔韦尔的半身人中，即乔拉斯科家族的治愈之纹和加兰达家族的好客之纹。这两种龙纹都很古老，第一次出现在半身人中的时间与艾瑞纳尔的精灵获得他们的第一个龙纹的时间差不多--在人类到达科尔瓦尔的几个世纪之前。有时加兰达家族的半身人开玩笑说，他们的印记让他们为人类的到来做好了准备，让他们的新客人在科尔韦尔感到舒适。幽默中其实也有一些道理：两个半身人家族提供的服务都有助于人类在大陆上的传播。",
	"With its powers related to food and shelter, the Mark of Hospitality was a boon to the early halfling nomads, but now it allows House Ghallanda to run the best inns, hostels, and taverns in the land. Similarly, the Mark of Healing has always been a boon to both nomads and settlers facing dangerous wilds, and House Jorasco still employs both magical and mundane healing techniques to tend to the well-being of patients across Khorvaire.": "凭借其与食物和住所有关的力量，好客的标志对早期的半身人游牧者来说是一个福音，但现在它使加兰达家族能够经营这片土地上最好的旅店、旅馆和酒馆。同样地，治疗的标记一直是游牧民族和定居者面对危险的荒野时的福音，乔拉斯科家族仍然采用魔法和世俗的治疗技术来照顾整个霍尔韦尔的病人的福祉。",
	"Dwarves are stoic. Elves are wise. Gnomes are cunning. And humans? They can't make up their mind, so they try to be all of these things at once.": "矮人是坚毅的。精灵是聪明的。侏儒是狡猾的。而人类呢？他们无法决定自己的想法，所以他们试图同时成为所有这些东西。",
	"The first human settlers came to Khorvaire about 3,000 years ago, landing in the area now known as the Lhazaar Principalities. From there, they began a slow but inexorable spread across the continent, disrupting the placid elven empire of Aerenal and leaving further ruined remnants of fallen Dhakaani goblin kingdoms in their wake. During this migration, they founded the settlements that would grow into the Five Nations. Even today humans make up the majority of the population in these countries. Despite their relatively short lifespans—or perhaps because of them—humans are innovative, adaptable, and aggressive, always pushing their limits and pursuing new ideas.": "第一批人类定居者大约在3000年前来到了Khorvaire，在现在被称为Lhazaar公国的地区登陆。从那里，他们开始缓慢但不可阻挡地蔓延到整个大陆，扰乱了平静的精灵帝国Aerenal，并在他们之后留下了更多堕落的达卡尼地精王国的废墟残骸。在这次迁徙中，他们建立了一些定居点，这些定居点后来发展成为五国。即使在今天，人类也占了这些国家人口的大多数。尽管他们的寿命相对较短，或者也许是因为他们的寿命，人类具有创新性、适应性和侵略性，总是在挑战自己的极限和追求新的想法。",
	"Humans prove extremely diverse; a barbarian from the Demon Wastes has little in common with a Brelish rogue.

The goblin empire scattered the orc tribes and forced them into harsh and unwanted lands: the swamps of the Shadow Marches, the Demon Wastes, and the depths of the Ironroot Mountains. But in the Shadow Marches, the orcs learned the secrets of druidic magic from the dragon Vvaraak, becoming the first of the Gatekeepers. With the invasion of the alien daelkyr from Xoriat, the Gatekeepers put the dragon's teaching to the test, creating magical seals that bound the daelkyr in the depths of Khyber and protected Eberron against further incursion from the plane of madness.": "在人类来到霍尔韦尔的几千年前，这片土地被达卡尼帝国的野生兽人和地精统治着。妖精帝国将兽人部落分散开来，迫使他们进入严酷而不受欢迎的土地：阴影沼泽、恶魔荒原和铁根山脉的深处。但在阴影地带，兽人从龙Vvaraak那里学到了德鲁伊魔法的秘密，成为第一批守门人。随着外来的达尔凯尔（daelkyr）从索里亚特入侵，守门人将龙的教导付诸实践，创造了神奇的封印，将达尔凯尔束缚在开伯尔的深处，保护埃伯龙免受来自疯狂世界的进一步入侵。",

However, many orcs succumbed to that same corruption and embraced the madness of the cults of the Dragon Below. Orcs who follow both of these paths continue to live in the Shadow Marches, and centuries of battles between them have diminished both sides.": "兽人守门员在击败达尔凯尔并将其邪恶束缚在开伯尔的过程中发挥了至关重要的作用，他们的后代继续维护着古老的封印，并与达尔凯尔的腐败所产生的异常现象作斗争。然而，许多兽人也屈服于这种堕落，接受了龙下之神的疯狂崇拜。遵循这两条道路的兽人继续生活在阴影地带，他们之间几个世纪的争斗使双方的力量都有所减弱。",

	"Patrons are more than a resource for your group to draw on, they are also a responsibility. Some patrons might be eager to support your group, while others might prove more demanding.": "赞助人不仅仅是你的团体可以利用的资源，他们也是一种责任。一些赞助人可能渴望支持你的团体，而另一些则可能要求更多。",
	"Your group's patron might occasionally come to you and give you an assignment. This can be an easy way to get into an adventure. Of course, it's up to you how you respond to your patron's demands, and interesting stories can emerge if you decide to refuse an assignment.": "你们小组的赞助人可能偶尔会来找你，给你一个任务。这可能是进入冒险的一个简单方法。当然，这取决于你如何回应你的赞助人的要求，如果你决定拒绝任务，就会出现有趣的故事。",
	"Even a patron that isn't heavy-handed can significantly motivate your group. Maybe you'll seek adventures based on what pleases your patron and so earn a reward. A university, for example, might not send you on a particular mission, but you might decide to follow leads to an ancient artifact hoping the university might reward you for bringing it back. You have the freedom to chart your own destiny, while still letting the patron shape the nature of your group and the adventures you undertake.": "即使是一个并不严厉的赞助人也能极大地激励你的团体。也许你会根据你的赞助人的喜好来寻求冒险，从而获得奖励。例如，一所大学可能不会派你去做某个特定的任务，但你可能会决定跟踪一个古代文物的线索，希望大学能奖励你把它带回来。你可以自由地规划自己的命运，同时还可以让赞助人决定你的团体的性质和你所进行的冒险。",
	"It might help to think of the patrons in this section in terms of three broad categories of autonomy:": "从三大类自主权的角度来考虑本节中的赞助人可能会有所帮助。",
	"With a {@b highly directive} patron, you are an employee of an organization, and the organization often tells you what to do. Crime syndicates, dragonmarked houses, espionage agencies, military forces, and newspapers are typically highly directive.": "有了{@b highly directive}赞助人，你就是一个组织的雇员，而这个组织往往会告诉你该怎么做。犯罪集团、龙纹屋、间谍机构、军队和报纸通常都是高度指令性的。",
	"With a {@b highly autonomous} patron, you are more like a freelancer. Your patron might offer you assignments or reward you for achieving certain objectives, but it doesn't dictate your activities. Adventurers' guilds, heads of state, immortal beings, inquisitive agencies, religious orders, and universities are typically highly autonomous.": "有了{@b highly autonomous}赞助人，你就更像一个自由职业者。你的赞助人可能会给你提供任务，或者奖励你实现某些目标，但它不会支配你的活动。冒险家协会、国家元首、不朽的生命、探究机构、宗教团体和大学通常都是高度自治的。",
	"In a {@b player-directed} organization, you don't have a patron because your adventuring party is in charge. You're the boss; you tell others what to do, and you're responsible to no one for your own activities. A criminal syndicate, inquisitive agency, military force, or newspaper can be a player-directed organization.": "在一个{@b player-directed}的组织中，你没有赞助人，因为你的冒险党是负责任的。你是老板；你告诉别人该怎么做，而你对自己的活动不对任何人负责。一个犯罪集团、调查机构、军事力量或报纸都可以是一个由玩家指导的组织。",
	"Every group patron offers your party a number of benefits for your service. These benefits range from standard business arrangements, like a salary and access to staff facilities, to more extraordinary boons, like audiences with powerful figures or exceptions from certain laws. Specific benefits are presented in more detail in the benefits section of each group patron.": "每个团体赞助人都会为你们的服务提供一些好处。这些好处包括标准的商业安排，如工资和使用工作人员的设施，以及更多特殊的好处，如与有权势的人物会面或某些法律的例外。具体的好处在每个团体赞助人的好处部分有更详细的介绍。",
	"Beyond the benefits described in each group patron's description, patrons can also grant additional favors. If your party is in good standing with your patron—proving yourselves reliable agents who fulfill the group's goals—your patron might grant requests for additional favors. A favor might take a variety of forms appropriate to the patron's area of influence or expertise, such as small loans, specialized equipment, or access to people and places you wouldn't otherwise have. Patrons who you regularly find yourself in conflict with aren't likely to grant you favors, unless doing so directly furthers their goals.": "除了每个团体赞助人描述的好处外，赞助人还可以给予额外的好处。如果你的党派与你的赞助人有良好的关系--证明你们是可靠的代理人，能实现团体的目标--你的赞助人可能会批准额外的好处请求。恩惠可以采取各种形式，适合赞助人的影响力或专业知识，如小额贷款、专门设备，或接触你无法接触的人和地方。那些经常与你发生冲突的赞助人不可能给你好处，除非这样做能直接促进他们的目标。",
	"In any case, the DM shouldn't feel limited to providing only the benefits noted in each group patron's description. Patrons give a party access to solutions and support they wouldn't have otherwise, and a patron might use their varied resources to guide their agents or prepare them for greater adventures.": "在任何情况下，DM都不应该觉得只提供每个团体赞助人描述中提到的好处是有限的。赞助人可以让一方获得他们无法获得的解决方案和支持，而且赞助人可能会利用他们的各种资源来指导他们的代理人，或者为他们准备更大的冒险。",
	"For certain kinds of organizations, you can either join an existing group or found your own. For some players, the idea of running a crime syndicate, inquisitive agency, mercenary company, or newspaper is much more exciting than working for someone else. Founding your own organization offers a greater degree of autonomy, though potentially at the cost of support and reliable work.": "对于某些类型的组织，你可以加入一个现有的团体，也可以建立自己的组织。对于一些玩家来说，经营一个犯罪集团、调查机构、雇佣兵公司或报纸的想法要比为别人工作更令人兴奋。创立自己的组织提供了更大程度的自主权，尽管有可能以获得支持和可靠的工作为代价。",
	"The information in this section applies whether you join an organization or found your own. When you're the boss, some of the benefits of belonging to an organization become expenses you have to worry about; when you run your own mercenary company, for example, you need to stock your own armory rather than drawing on an existing organization's stockpile. The organization brings in income, but you'll have to spend some of it to keep the organization running.": "无论你是加入一个组织还是建立自己的组织，本节中的信息都适用。当你是老板时，属于一个组织的一些好处变成了你必须担心的开支；例如，当你经营自己的雇佣兵公司时，你需要储备自己的军械库，而不是从现有组织的库存中获取。组织带来了收入，但你必须花费其中的一部分来维持组织的运行。",
	"When you run your own organization, you can use the Running a Business downtime activity (see {@book chapter 6|DMG|6} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}) to reflect your organization's ongoing activities. More than one character can take part in this activity at a time. When rolling to determine the business's performance, add the total days spent by all the characters to the roll to determine the business's success (still observing the maximum of 30). If the business earns a profit, multiply that profit by 4 + the number of characters who took part in this downtime activity.": "当你经营自己的组织时，你可以使用经营企业的停工活动（见{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}的{@book chapter 6|DMG|6}）来反映你的组织的持续活动。一次可以有一个以上的角色参加这个活动。当滚动确定企业的业绩时，将所有角色花费的总天数加入到滚动中，以确定企业的成功（仍然遵守30的上限）。如果该企业获得了利润，则将该利润乘以4+参加该停工活动的人物数量。",

	"Your group has ties to a network of professional adventurers. These experts share contacts, resources, and leads on all manner of unusual and often dangerous work.

They might point you to adventures halfway across the world, but the general assumption is that you'll always come home to your guildhall, sooner or later.": "除了少数例外，冒险者公会的范围都是本地的，因为他们的主要利益集中在公会大厅。他们可能会指点你去世界各地的冒险，但一般的假设是，你总是会回到你的公会，迟早的事。",
	"Sharn's Clifftop neighborhood, located in the upper part of the Dura district, has long served as a crossroads for adventurers and soldiers of fortune. A dwarf named Shekkal Korranor established the Clifftop Adventurers' Guild 150 years ago, intending it as a place where explorers and wanderers could find support and good company. Shekkal died in the Last War, but the guild remains—a social club for adventurers and a one-stop marketplace for anyone seeking capable champions.": "沙恩的悬崖顶街区，位于杜拉区的上部，长期以来一直是冒险家和财富战士的十字路口。150年前，一个名叫Shekkal Korranor的矮人建立了悬崖顶冒险者公会，打算将其作为探险者和流浪者可以找到支持和好伙伴的地方。Shekkal在最后一次战争中死去，但公会仍然存在--一个冒险家的社交俱乐部，一个为寻求有能力的冠军的人提供的一站式市场。",

The neighborhood around it caters to adventurers' other needs with its variety of shops and services.": "悬崖顶冒险者协会总部是其所在地区的物质和社会中心，是一座巨大的石头建筑，是用一生的冒险经历获得的财富建造的。部分是安静的图书馆，部分是舒适的旅馆，部分是活跃的体育馆，部分是喧闹的酒馆，公会总部几乎包含了冒险者训练、学习和社交所需的所有设施。它周围的街区以各种商店和服务来满足冒险者的其他需求。",
	"Most of the members of the Clifftop Adventurers' Guild have a modest amount of experience as successful adventurers.

	"Relationships with most of the guild's allies are based on business and built on upstanding reputations. Ultimately, though, the guild is a loose affiliation of groups, and organizations that have a good relationship with one of those groups might not transfer their good will to another. The following groups do brisk business with members of the Clifftop Adventurers' Guild:": "与公会大多数盟友的关系都是基于业务，建立在良好的声誉上。不过，归根结底，公会是一个松散的团体联盟，与其中一个团体有良好关系的组织可能不会把他们的善意转移到另一个团体。以下团体与悬崖顶冒险者协会的成员做着活跃的生意。",
	"Watch Commander Lian Halamar, in charge of the large and prestigious Daggerwatch Garrison in Sharn's Dura quarter, has long been suspected of ties to the infamous Boromar Clan. Though these suspicions are often dismissed as simple prejudice in the assumption that any halfling in Sharn must be associated with the crime syndicate, the Voice of Breland, in cooperation with civic-minded members of the Clifftop Adventurers' Guid, have uncovered stunning evidence confirming this connection. The Clifftop guild denies claims that these accusations embody the latest fracas in the long-running tensions between the Daggerwatch Garrison and the city's various groups of heroes for hire.": "负责沙恩杜拉区庞大而著名的匕首守卫部队的守卫指挥官廉-哈拉马，长期以来一直被怀疑与臭名昭著的波罗马家族有关系。尽管这些怀疑常常被认为是简单的偏见，认为沙恩的任何半身人都必须与犯罪集团有关，但布雷兰之声与具有公民意识的克利夫托普冒险者协会成员合作，发现了证实这种联系的惊人证据。崖顶公会否认了这些指控体现了匕首守卫队和城市的各种雇佣英雄团体之间长期以来的紧张关系中的最新争吵。",
	"{@b Affiliated guilds}.

	"{@b Clifftop businesses}. The guild is a prominent feature in its neighborhood, and much of the area is dedicated to meeting guild's needs.

	"{@b House Tharashk}. The Tharashk enclave in Clifftop provides the services of guides with extensive experience exploring Xend'rik, and it is careful to retain only guides who receive positive referrals from guild members. House Tharashk also uses the guild as a means to hire adventurers to serve as bodyguards on their own prospecting expeditions.": "{@b House Tharashk}. 位于Clifftop的Tharashk飞地提供具有丰富探索Xend'rik经验的向导服务，并且它很谨慎地只保留那些得到公会成员积极推荐的向导。萨拉什克家族还利用公会作为手段，雇佣冒险者作为他们自己勘探探险的保镖。",

	"{@b Sharn Watch}. Clifftop is protected of the Daggerwatch Garrison and Watch Commander Lian Halamar. Halamar has no love for adventurers and is happy to catch guild members on the wrong side of the law.": "{@b Sharn Watch}. 悬崖顶受到匕首守卫军和守卫指挥官Lian Halamar的保护。哈拉玛对冒险者没有好感，他很高兴能抓到犯法的公会成员。",
	"As members of an adventurers' guild, your group gains the following benefits:": "作为冒险家协会的成员，你的团体可以获得以下好处。",

	"{@b Storage}. The guild will store items for its members. The Clifftop guild has an account with House Kundarak banks that allow its members to store valuables in secure vaults. Some guilds have access to items such as a {@item bag of holding} or a safe that opens into a similar extradimensional space. In the worst case, an item can be hidden in a guildhall's basement for a time.": "{@b Storage}. 该公会将为其成员储存物品。崖顶公会在昆达拉克家族银行有一个账户，允许其成员在安全的金库中储存贵重物品。一些行会可以获得诸如{@item bag of holding}或打开到类似次元空间的保险箱的物品。在最坏的情况下，一件物品可以在公会的地下室里隐藏一段时间。",

	"Typically, an adventuring group has no particular contact within the larger guild.

The Guild Contact table provides inspiration for contacts you might encounter during any given encounter with your adventurer's guild.": "通常情况下，一个冒险团在大的行会中没有特别的联系。有一个当地的领导或簿记员负责收取会费，但除此之外，你可能会在不同的情况下与公会的不同成员打交道--在寻找合同、收集推荐人、住在公会大厅等等。公会联系人表提供了你在与冒险者公会的任何特定接触中可能遇到的联系人的灵感。",

Named for the lower-class district in Sharn where it maintains its guildhall, the Deathsgate Explorers' Club is a rough-and-tumble guild made up largely of Last War veterans.

Founded by a renowned hunter and explorer, Lord Boroman ir'Dayne, the Wayfinder Foundation is an exclusive adventurers' guild that welcomes only experienced and renowned members. Dayne suffers from a wasting curse that prevents him from undertaking further adventures of his own, so he has put his considerable fortune to use in sponsoring great expeditions.

	"Your group is a team of crooks that's part of an organized crime syndicate. You're more talented and have a wider range of skills than most thugs and burglars, so your crew might be entrusted with more important tasks than simply roughing up local merchants or breaking into empty apartments.

	"Crime syndicates thrived during the Last War. The war left many people desperate, driving them into lives of crime. The war also demanded huge numbers of able-bodied soldiers, which reduced the ranks of law enforcement across Khorvaire. As a result, most settlements have some organized criminal element, ranging from small local thieves' guilds to international organizations with dozens of interconnected branches.": "犯罪集团在最后一次战争期间蓬勃发展。战争使许多人感到绝望，促使他们走上犯罪的道路。战争还需要大量的精壮的士兵，这使得整个霍尔韦尔的执法队伍减少。因此，大多数定居点都有一些有组织的犯罪因素，从小型的地方盗贼行会到拥有几十个相互联系的分支机构的国际组织。",

They have a stranglehold on the smuggling trade and own the majority of the gambling halls in the city, while most of the fences and thieves in Sharn either work directly for the them or pay tribute in exchange for independence. The Boromars control a vast network of extortion, blackmail, and graft that extends throughout the city, and their influence reaches far beyond the criminal underworld. The early Boromar patriarchs invested wisely over the centuries, and today the Boromars are one of the Sixty, the elite tier of Sharn's aristocracy. The Boromar Clan owns warehouses, taverns, and inns throughout the city, and it has a considerable interest in the shipping trade. A Boromar heir sits on the city council of Sharn, and the current head of the clan is a member of the Gold Concord of the Aurum (described in {@book chapter 4|ERLW|11|The Boromar Clan}).": "波罗玛家族是沙恩市最强大的犯罪组织。从最初的走私犯和盗贼团伙，波洛玛家族已经崛起，成为城市中最有影响力的势力之一。他们垄断了走私贸易，并拥有城市中大部分的赌博厅，而沙恩的大多数栅栏和盗贼要么直接为他们工作，要么支付贡品以换取独立。波罗玛人控制着一个庞大的敲诈、勒索和嫁接网络，延伸到整个城市，他们的影响力远远超出了黑社会的范畴。几个世纪以来，早期的博罗玛族长进行了明智的投资，如今博罗玛族是沙恩贵族中的精英阶层--60人之一。波罗玛家族在整个城市拥有仓库、酒馆和旅店，并在航运贸易中拥有相当大的利益。波洛马的继承人是沙恩市议会的成员，该家族的现任族长是奥鲁姆黄金协约的成员（详见（%0%））。",
	"As much as some members of the Sharn Council and the Watch would like to see the Boromars disbanded, the syndicate is unlikely to collapse any time soon.": "尽管沙恩委员会和守望先锋的一些成员很想看到博罗玛人被解散，但这个集团不太可能很快就会崩溃。",
	"The core membership of the Boromar Clan—comprising about one in six of its members—is an extended family of halflings descended from immigrants who came to Sharn from the Talenta Plains. Another third of the members are unrelated halflings, and the rest belong to other species. The syndicate employs a wide variety of bookkeepers and administrators as well as burglars, con artists, smugglers, and other criminals. When a situation calls for physical violence, the Boromars usually hire freelancers—members of the Sharn Guard or agents of House Tarkanan. The Boromar family proper has a team of personal bodyguards called the Clawfoots, who are mostly fierce halfling warriors recently relocated from the Talenta Plains. They primarily defend Boromar holdings and headquarters in the halfling district of Little Plains.": "Boromar氏族的核心成员--约占其成员总数的六分之一--是一个半身人的大家庭，他们是来自塔伦塔平原的移民的后代。另外三分之一的成员是没有血缘关系的半身人，其余的属于其他物种。该集团雇佣了各种各样的簿记员和行政人员，以及窃贼、骗子、走私者和其他罪犯。当需要使用暴力的时候，波洛玛家族通常会雇佣自由职业者--沙恩卫队的成员或塔卡南家族的代理人。波罗玛家族有一队私人保镖，叫做 \"爪足\"，他们大多是最近从塔伦塔平原迁来的凶猛的半身人战士。他们主要保卫博罗玛的财产和位于小平原的半身人区的总部。",
	"The Boromar Clan has a reputation for omnipotence that makes even the forces of law and order in Sharn hesitant to cross it. It's far safer to be an ally of the syndicate, or at least to stay out of its way, than it is to be its enemy—and it's more lucrative to boot. The following groups count themselves among the Boromar Clan's closest allies:": "Boromar家族有一个无所不能的名声，甚至让沙恩的法律和秩序力量都对它犹豫不决。成为该集团的盟友，或者至少不受其影响，要比成为其敌人安全得多，而且更有利可图。以下团体是波罗马家族最亲密的盟友之一。",
	"{@b House Jorasco}. The head of the Boromar Clan, Saidan Boromar, is married to an unmarked heir of House Jorasco, Mala Boromar d'Jorasco. This marriage has created important ties between the Boromars and the halfling healers of Sharn. Members of the Boromar family can secure healing for free, and other members of the syndicate receive a 10 percent discount at Jorasco houses of healing.": "{@b House Jorasco}. 波罗玛家族的首领，赛丹-波罗玛，与乔拉斯科家族的一位无名继承人玛拉-波罗玛-德-乔拉斯科结婚。这场婚姻在博罗玛家族和沙恩的半身人治疗师之间建立了重要的联系。博罗玛家族的成员可以免费获得治疗，而集团的其他成员在乔拉斯科的治疗机构可以获得10%的折扣。",
	"{@b Sharn Council}. Of the seventeen members of Sharn's city council, four have close ties to the Boromar Clan—including one, Ilyra Boromar, who reports directly to the head of the syndicate. These four vote as a bloc to ensure that the council doesn't take direct action against the Boromars, while enough of the other council members fear the syndicate that they tend to carry the vote. A member of the Boromar Clan can call in a favor to secure an audience with one of these councilors, though such does not guarantee aid.": "{@b Sharn Council}. 在沙恩市议会的17名成员中，有4人与波洛玛家族关系密切--包括一个叫伊拉-波洛玛的人，他直接向集团的负责人汇报。这四个人作为一个集团投票，以确保议会不对波洛玛家族采取直接行动，而其他议会成员对集团有足够的恐惧，所以他们倾向于进行投票。波罗玛氏族的成员可以通过求助来确保与这些理事之一会面，但这并不能保证得到援助。",
	"{@b Sharn Watch}. The Boromars have been bribing captains of the Sharn Watch for generations. What's more, if the Boromar Clan collapsed, the underworld would erupt in anarchy as dozens of petty crime lords fought for territory and position. As a result, a member of the Boromars can call in a favor to get minor criminal charges dismissed.": "{@b Sharn Watch}. 波罗玛人世代都在贿赂沙恩观察站的队长。更重要的是，如果波洛玛尔家族垮台，黑社会将爆发无政府状态，因为几十个小犯罪头目为了争夺地盘和地位而大打出手。因此，波洛玛尔家族的成员可以叫人帮忙，使轻微的刑事指控被撤销。",
	"Despite the Boromar Clan's position of strength in Sharn, it has many foes, and their unrelenting assaults have put the syndicate in what might be its most precarious position ever. Currently, the following groups pose the greatest threats to Boromar interests:": "尽管波罗马家族在沙恩的地位很强，但它有很多敌人，他们无情的攻击使该集团处于可能是有史以来最危险的境地。目前，以下团体对波罗马的利益构成了最大的威胁。",
	"{@b Daask}. The monstrous criminal guild called Daask, a pawn of the leaders of Droaam, has started launching violent raids against Boromar holdings over the last two years. A mobile organization using guerrilla tactics, Daask has managed to circumvent Boromar security and avoid serious reprisals for a range of violent thefts and sabotages. Agents of Daask go out of their way to harm up-and-coming Boromar agents.": "{@b Daask}. 被称为Daask的畸形犯罪行会是Droaam领导人的棋子，在过去两年中开始对Boromar的财产发动暴力袭击。作为一个使用游击战术的流动组织，Daask已经成功地绕过了Boromar的安全，并避免了一系列暴力盗窃和破坏行为的严重报复。达斯克的特工不顾一切地伤害新晋的Boromar特工。",
	"{@b Sharn Council}. Despite four friends on the city council, the Boromar Clan has several enemies as well. At least three councilors oppose the Boromars because of genuine concern for their constituents; two more oppose the syndicate because they're part of rival organizations (the Aurum and the Tyrants). Because of their influence, the council has so far refused to devote any resources to combating the rise of Daask, hoping the monstrous guild will bring down the Boromars. Individual members of the Boromar Clan can be sure that these councilors will oppose any petition they might bring to the council.": "{@b Sharn Council}. 尽管市议会中有四个朋友，但波罗马家族也有几个敌人。至少有三位议员因为真正关心他们的选民而反对Boromars；还有两位议员因为是敌对组织（Aurum和Tyrants）的成员而反对该集团。由于他们的影响力，议会至今拒绝投入任何资源来打击达斯克的崛起，希望这个畸形的行会能打倒波罗马人。波罗玛氏族的个别成员可以确信，这些议员会反对他们可能提交给议会的任何请愿书。",
	"With a crime syndicate as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:": "如果有一个犯罪集团作为你的团体的赞助人，你会获得以下好处。",
	"The annual Tain Gala, as everyone knows, brings the wealthiest and most prominent citizens of Sharn together in a grand display of opulence and power. But last night, it also provided a shocking display of violence, as Saidan Boromar—head of the Boromar family, which is allegedly tied to all manner of criminal activities throughout the city—was confronted by a would-be assassin (whose name will not be made public until her next of kin have been identified and notified). Boromar and his wife, Mala Boromar d'Jorasco, escaped unharmed thanks to the timely intervention of their bodyguard, a recent immigrant from the Talenta Plains whose fascinating culture and fierce demeanor were both in plain view last night. A Boromar spokesperson identified the bodyguard as Halak Boromar, head of the Clawfoots—the Boromar family's personal guard, named for the dinosaurs ridden by halflings in the Talenta Plains.": "众所周知，一年一度的泰恩盛会将沙恩最富有和最有名望的公民聚集在一起，隆重展示财富和权力。但昨晚，它也提供了一个令人震惊的暴力展示，因为赛丹-博罗玛--博罗玛家族的首领，据称与整个城市的各种犯罪活动有关--被一个可能的刺客（在她的近亲被确认和通知之前，她的名字不会被公开）撞见。博罗玛和他的妻子玛拉-博罗玛-乔拉斯科（Mala Boromar d'Jorasco）安然无恙，这要归功于他们的保镖的及时干预，他是来自塔伦塔平原的新移民，其迷人的文化和凶狠的举止都在昨晚一览无余。波洛马的发言人指出，这位保镖名叫哈拉克-波洛马，是波洛马家族的私人护卫队队长，以塔伦塔平原上半身人骑的恐龙命名。",
	"{@b Assignments}. The Boromar Clan doesn't pay you, but it might assign you to particular tasks. Sometimes these are tasks someone has hired the syndicate to perform (such as an assassination), in which case the syndicate passes 85 percent of the fee on to your group. Other times, your aim is to enrich the syndicate (such as by pulling off a heist), in which case you have the privilege of keeping 85 percent of what you steal. Other syndicates might take more or less than a 15 percent share, at the DM's discretion.": "{@b Assignments}. 波洛玛氏族不付给你报酬，但它可能会指派你完成特定的任务。有时，这些任务是有人雇佣该集团执行的（如暗杀），在这种情况下，该集团会将85%的费用转给你的团队。还有一些时候，你的目的是为了丰富集团的财富（例如通过抢劫），在这种情况下，你有特权保留你所偷的东西的85%。其他辛迪加可能会多拿或少拿15%的份额，由DM决定。",
	"{@b Contraband}. You have access to your syndicate's \"business\" of dealing with contraband, such as poisons or narcotics. You don't receive a discount on these goods, but you can always find someplace to purchase them.": "{@b Contraband}. 你可以进入你的辛迪加的 \"业务\"，处理违禁品，如毒药或麻醉品。你在这些货物上得不到折扣，但你总能找到地方购买它们。",
	"{@b Fences}. Members or associates of your syndicate are skilled at disposing of stolen goods, and you have access to this service as well. Fences are useful for selling not just illicit goods but also expensive items such as works of art and even magic items. In the case of magic items, this allows you to delegate the work of finding a buyer (a downtime activity described in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} and {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}) to the fence. The drawback is that you don't get to choose whether to accept the offer you might receive—the fence makes that call for you.": "{@b Fences}. 你的集团成员或同伙擅长处理赃物，你也可以使用这项服务。栅栏不仅对出售非法货物很有用，而且对出售昂贵的物品，如艺术品甚至魔法物品也很有用。就魔法物品而言，这允许你将寻找买家的工作（在{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}和{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}中描述的停机活动）委托给围栏。缺点是，你不能选择是否接受你可能收到的报价--栅栏为你做了这个决定。",
	"{@b Immunity}. As a member of the Boromar Clan, you are protected from other members of the clan. No one in your syndicate targets you for their own criminal operations. (Of course, the same is expected of you.) On the other hand, if you have rivals within the clan, they might find other ways to interfere with your activities.": "{@b Immunity}. 作为波洛马氏族的成员，你受到保护，不受该氏族其他成员的影响。你的集团中没有人以你为目标进行他们自己的犯罪活动。(当然，对你也是如此。）另一方面，如果你在氏族内有对手，他们可能会找到其他方法来干扰你的活动。",
	"{@b Syndicate-Owned Businesses}. The Boromar Clan owns several businesses, primarily as fronts for laundering money. When you buy from one of these businesses, you get a 5 percent discount. The DM decides what goods and services are available.": "{@b Syndicate-Owned Businesses}. Boromar家族拥有几家企业，主要是作为洗钱的幌子。当你从这些企业中购买时，你可以得到5%的折扣。DM决定有哪些商品和服务。",
	"Naturally, a large portion of the Boromar Clan's members come from a criminal background. There's no reason characters with other backgrounds can't be part of the syndicate, though. The Boromars recruit ex-soldiers as muscle, trained sages for research, sailors to crew smuggling vessels, and charlatans and urchins for their unique talents. Consider some or all of these roles for characters in your party:": "自然，博洛玛家族的大部分成员都有犯罪背景。不过，没有理由其他背景的人物不能成为该集团的一员。波罗玛人招募退役士兵作为肌肉，招募训练有素的圣人进行研究，招募水手作为走私船的船员，招募江湖骗子和顽童以发挥他们的独特才能。考虑在你的队伍中扮演这些角色中的一部分或全部。",
	"{@b Bruiser}. Sometimes subtlety means breaking just one of a snitch's kneecaps. The Bruiser uses force and the threat of force to make sure that the crime syndicate gets what it wants. Strength is a natural prerequisite for the role, but Charisma can also be useful, especially when combined with proficiency in {@skill Intimidation} to reinforce the danger inherent in the Bruiser's presence. Plenty of Bruisers have a criminal past, but former soldiers are often recruited into this role as well. Fighters and rogues make natural Bruisers.": "{@b Bruiser}. 有时微妙的做法意味着只需打破一个告密者的膝盖骨。恶棍使用武力和武力威胁来确保犯罪集团得到它想要的东西。力量是这个角色的先决条件，但魅力也是有用的，特别是当与精通{@skill Intimidation}相结合时，可以加强布鲁斯的内在危险。很多布鲁斯人都有犯罪的过去，但前士兵也经常被招募到这个角色。战士和流氓是天然的布鲁斯人。",
	"{@b Burglar}. Agile and nimble, the Burglar relies on Dexterity and proficiency in skills such as {@skill Acrobatics}, {@skill Sleight of Hand}, and {@skill Stealth} to get in to a target location, take valuables, and get out without being noticed. Some Burglars specialize in certain types of theft, such as housebreaking or picking pockets. Besides characters with the criminal background, young urchins often find a place in criminal syndicates by filling this role. Rogues are natural Burglars, but anyone else with the right combination of skills and abilities can do the job.": "{@b Burglar}. 敏捷和灵活，盗贼依靠灵巧和熟练的技能，如{@skill Acrobatics}、{@skill Sleight of Hand}和{@skill Stealth}，进入目标地点，拿走贵重物品，然后不被发现地离开。有些盗贼专门从事某些类型的盗窃，如破门而入或扒窃口袋。除了有犯罪背景的人物，年轻的顽童经常通过扮演这个角色在犯罪集团中找到一席之地。罗格是天生的盗贼，但其他任何拥有正确技能和能力组合的人都可以做这项工作。",
	"{@b Mastermind}. Somebody has to be the brains of any criminal operation—that's where the Mastermind comes in. A high Intelligence benefits this character, as does proficiency in skills such as {@skill Insight} and {@skill Investigation}. Masterminds often come from backgrounds such as acolyte, noble, or sage, that give them a broad range of knowledge to support their schemes. Bards, rogues, and wizards are often drawn to this role.": "{@b Mastermind}. 任何犯罪活动都必须有人负责，这就是主谋的作用。高智力对这个人物有利，熟练掌握{@skill Insight}和{@skill Investigation}等技能也是如此。策划者通常来自于圣徒、贵族或贤者等背景，这使他们拥有广泛的知识来支持他们的计划。吟游诗人、流氓和巫师经常被吸引到这个角色。",
	"{@b Safecracker}. The \"breaking\" part of \"breaking and entering\" is the Safecracker's job. A typical Safecracker might have proficiency with thieves' tools, as well as the Dexterity required to use them expertly. Intelligence can be important for figuring out complicated locks and secret doors. Many Safecrackers also boast a high Strength for those cases where lockpicks fail. Safecrackers often come from criminal backgrounds, but characters with experience using other tools and devices, including guild artisans and even sailors, also fall naturally into this role. Artificer or rogue makes a natural class choice for the Safecracker.": "{@b Safecracker}. 破门而入 \"中的 \"破门 \"部分是安全窃贼的工作。一个典型的盗贼可能会熟练掌握盗贼的工具，以及熟练使用这些工具所需的灵巧能力。智力对于弄清复杂的锁和秘密的门很重要。许多安全钳工还拥有很高的实力，以应对锁具失效的情况。安全钳工通常有犯罪背景，但有使用其他工具和设备经验的人物，包括行会工匠甚至水手，也会自然而然地进入这个角色。工匠或流氓是安全钳工的自然等级选择。",
	"{@b Talker}. From con artists to fences, anyone who relies on interpersonal skills and a network of contacts falls into the role of the Talker. Charisma proves useful for this role, along with proficiencies in skills such as {@skill Deception}, {@skill Intimidation}, and {@skill Persuasion}. The charlatan background is perfect for Talkers, but criminals, urchins, and others can fill the role with the right skills. Bards are a natural fit for the job as well.": "{@b Talker}. 从骗子到围墙，任何依靠人际关系技巧和联系网络的人都属于谈话者的角色。魅力对这一角色很有用，同时还需要精通一些技能，如（1%）、（2%）和（3%）。骗子的背景很适合说话者，但罪犯、顽童和其他人也可以用合适的技能来扮演这个角色。吟游诗人也很自然地适合这个工作。",
	"Your work as syndicate members involves more than simple street swindles or pickpocketing. A team with your skills comes together for greater purposes—more dangerous risks and far more splendid rewards. As a group, consider the options on the Syndicate Crimes table and work with your DM to decide what kinds of work you do for the Boromar Clan.": "作为集团成员，你们的工作不仅仅涉及简单的街头诈骗或扒窃。一个拥有你的技能的团队会为了更伟大的目标而聚在一起--更危险的风险和更丰厚的回报。作为一个团体，考虑一下 \"辛迪加犯罪 \"表中的选项，并与你的DM一起决定你为波罗马家族做哪些工作。",
	"{@b Acquisitions and Retrieval}. Your job is to acquire assets for the syndicate. You might steal important documents or clear out a location for use as a hideout.": "{@b Acquisitions and Retrieval}. 你的工作是为该集团获取资产。你可能会偷取重要的文件，或者清理出一个地点作为藏身之处。",
	"{@b Heists}. You plan and execute elaborate robberies that require the skills of everyone on your team.": "{@b Heists}. 你计划并执行精心设计的抢劫案，需要你团队中每个人的技能。",
	"{@b Gang Warfare}. Your primary job is to ensure that no other crime syndicate (such as Daask or House Tarkanan) gains a significant foothold in your territory.": "{@b Gang Warfare}. 你的主要工作是确保没有其他犯罪集团（如Daask或Tarkanan家族）在你的领土上获得一个重要的立足点。",
	"{@b Internal Affairs}. Your task is to keep all the corrupt, headstrong, and avaricious members of your syndicate in line with the goals and rules of the group.": "{@b Internal Affairs}. 你的任务是让你的集团中所有腐败的、刚愎自用的、贪婪的成员与集团的目标和规则保持一致。",
	"{@b Assassination}. Your work involves killing prominent people—the sort who have numerous bodyguards and elaborate security systems to circumvent.": "{@b Assassination}. 你的工作涉及杀戮知名人士--那种有众多保镖和精心设计的安全系统可以规避的人。",
	"{@b Topple the Powerful}. Your syndicate might be criminal and your methods illegal, but your goals are righteous. You help people who are powerless to defend themselves against exploitation by the rich and powerful.": "{@b Topple the Powerful}. 你的集团可能是犯罪，你的方法是非法的，但你的目标是正义的。你帮助那些无力保护自己免受富人和权贵剥削的人。",
	"Even among the notorious Boromar Clan, your group has a distinct identity and a reputation. What's the event or unique trait that makes your crew stand out? Consult the Group Infamy table for suggestions on how your group might stand out within the larger syndicate.": "即使在臭名昭著的波罗马家族中，你们的团队也有一个独特的身份和声誉。是什么事件或独特的特质让你的团队脱颖而出？请参考团体恶名表，看看你的团体如何在更大的集团中脱颖而出。",
	"{@b Tattoos}. Each member of your group has a distinct tattoo that inspires fear in others. When possible, you use the symbol as a calling card to mark your work.": "{@b Tattoos}. 你们小组的每个成员都有一个独特的纹身，能激发别人的恐惧。在可能的情况下，你用这个符号作为名片来标记你的工作。",
	"{@b Outfit}. Whether it is a leather duster with a group symbol or a distinctive handkerchief tucked in your pocket, your gang has a signature accessory.": "{@b Outfit}. 无论是带有团体标志的皮革掸子，还是塞在口袋里的独特手帕，你的团伙都有一个标志性的配件。",
	"{@b Infamy}. Your group is linked to an infamous crime, one that remains the talk of the town.": "{@b Infamy}. 你的团体与一起臭名昭著的犯罪有关，这起犯罪仍然是镇上的话题。",
	"{@b Idols}. A certain type of person finds criminals alluring, and your band has acquired a group of such hangers-on. They're not criminals themselves, just outsiders who admire you for your brutality, cunning, or flair.": "{@b Idols}. 某种类型的人觉得罪犯很诱人，而你的乐队已经获得了一群这样的挂靠者。他们本身不是罪犯，只是因为你的残暴、狡猾或天赋而钦佩你的外人。",
	"{@b Legitimate}. The Boromar Clan has a legitimate front, though everyone knows the truth behind it. You're part of that facade of legitimacy, but you have a reputation for getting away with (literal) murder.": "{@b Legitimate}. Boromar家族有一个合法的幌子，尽管每个人都知道它背后的真相。你是这个合法幌子的一部分，但你有逃脱（字面）谋杀的声誉。",
	"{@b Legends}. You have an air of mystery, and people whisper that you command strange powers. True or not, this reputation keeps people out of your way.": "{@b Legends}. 你有一种神秘的气息，人们低声说你拥有奇怪的力量。不管是真是假，这种声誉使人们对你敬而远之。",
	"Some criminals believe you can't do a job without betraying your partners. Perhaps you have your own share of adversaries you've angered. The Group Rivals table presents a host of groups and individuals who might—legitimately or otherwise—hold a grudge against you.": "一些罪犯认为，你不背叛你的伙伴就无法完成工作。也许你也有自己的对手被你激怒。团体对手表列出了许多团体和个人，他们可能--合法的或其他的--对你怀有怨恨。",
	"{@b The Law}. Someone in the Sharn Watch has vowed to put you in prison or die trying.": "{@b The Law}. 沙恩观察的某个人发誓要把你送进监狱，否则就得死。",
	"{@b Gang War}. Some members of a rival syndicate (such as Daask, House Tarkanan, or the Tyrants) hate you, probably for good reason.": "{@b Gang War}. 敌对集团的一些成员（如达斯克、塔卡南家族或暴君）讨厌你，可能有充分的理由。",
	"{@b The Press}. Your group's adventures make for great headlines. Your every move is reported in the broadsheets and your steps are dogged by journalists.": "{@b The Press}. 你的团体的冒险是很好的头条新闻。你的一举一动都会被大报报道，你的脚步也会被记者追问。",
	"{@b Infighting}. Another group within the Boromar Clan is jealous of your success or angry about a past wrong. They do everything they can to undercut you.": "{@b Infighting}. 波洛马氏族中的另一个团体嫉妒你的成功，或对过去的错误感到愤怒。他们尽其所能地削弱你。",
	"{@b Vigilante}. A citizen you wronged has sworn vengeance. Around any corner, you might find yourself facing a vigilante or a posse of angry citizens out for your blood.": "{@b Vigilante}. 一个被你冤枉的公民发誓要报仇。在任何一个角落，你都可能发现自己面对的是一个义务警员或一群愤怒的公民，他们要杀你。",
	"{@b The Bosses}. The halfling family in control of the syndicate has its eye on you, taking pains to keep you in line and make sure you stay loyal.": "{@b The Bosses}. 控制集团的半身人家族盯上了你，不遗余力地让你保持一致，确保你保持忠诚。",
	"Everyone has a well-defined place in the Boromar Clan hierarchy. You report to a contact who oversees your work, giving you assignments, and collecting the syndicate's cut. This person might be a criminal mastermind who plans all your exploits, or they could leave the planning to your group. In any case, the Syndicate Contact table can help you define the personality of this contact.": "每个人在波洛马氏族的等级制度中都有一个明确的位置。你向一个监督你工作的联系人报告，给你分配任务，并收取集团的分成。这个人可能是一个计划你所有行动的犯罪主谋，或者他们可以把计划留给你的小组。在任何情况下，辛迪加联系人表可以帮助你定义这个联系人的个性。",
	"A surrogate parent who views you as challenging but beloved children": "一个将你们视为具有挑战性但受人喜爱的孩子的代理家长",
	"A no-nonsense boss who treats the syndicate's work as just another business": "一个不苟言笑的老板，把辛迪加的工作当作另一项业务。",

	"A former urchin, now fabulously wealthy, who wants to see everyone in the syndicate find the same success": "一个曾经的顽童，现在富得流油，他希望看到集团中的每个人都能找到同样的成功。",
	"The boss at a gambling den or similar house of vice who enjoys the business just a little too much": "赌馆或类似的淫秽场所的老板，他只是有点太喜欢这一行了。",
	"A kind-hearted crook who's grateful to finally be able to delegate the dirty work on the streets to you": "一个心地善良的骗子，终于可以把街上的脏活累活交给你，他很感激。",

	"A former law enforcement officer who is full of cheerful tips for avoiding the law": "一位前执法官员，对避开法律充满了欢快的提示",
	"The city of Sharn is unusual in that it is home to no less than four powerful syndicates, which somehow have not yet managed to wipe each other out. The Boromar Clan is one crime syndicate, while the others include the following groups:": "沙恩市的不寻常之处在于，它是不少于四个强大的集团的家，而这些集团不知为何还没有设法消灭对方。波洛马氏族是一个犯罪集团，而其他集团包括以下几个。",
	"Imagine it: a long-lasting state of euphoria, a feeling of power and energy, a measurable impact on certain magical powers, and the risk of addiction and deadly overdose with every use. That's the thrill of the drug called dragon's blood, which currently enjoys skyrocketing popularity in Sharn. Every day the death toll from this mysterious substance rises among \"blood addicts.\" And no wonder, as it's produced in Droaam and sold in drams or \"veins\" by the monstrous thugs of Daask, who surely seek nothing less than to destroy the prosperity of Sharn but targeting its most precious resource: its sober, hardworking people. Remember friends, \"Stay on the wagon. Say NO to dragon!\"": "想象一下：一种持久的兴奋状态，一种力量和能量的感觉，对某些魔力有可衡量的影响，以及每次使用都有上瘾和致命的过量风险。这就是被称为龙血的药物所带来的快感，它目前在沙恩享有极高的人气。每天，这种神秘物质造成的死亡人数在 \"血瘾者 \"中不断上升。这也难怪，因为它产自德拉姆，由达斯克的畸形暴徒以德拉姆或 \"静脉 \"的形式出售，他们肯定只想破坏沙恩的繁荣，但目标是它最宝贵的资源：它清醒、勤劳的人民。记住朋友们，\"留在马车上。对龙说不！\"",
	"{@b Daask}. Daask is an aggressive criminal organization with cells across Khorvaire. Led by monstrous immigrants from Droaam—gnolls, harpies, medusas, minotaurs, ogres, trolls, and others—the group is ultimately under the command of Sora Katra, one of the rulers of Droaam. Physical violence is its specialty, but Daask also dabbles in illegal drugs.": "{@b Daask}. 达斯克（Daask）是一个咄咄逼人的犯罪组织，在霍尔韦尔各地都有分部。该组织由来自德拉姆（Droaam）的畸形移民领导，其中包括巨魔、女妖、梅杜莎人、牛头人、食人魔、巨魔等，最终受德拉姆统治者之一索拉-卡特拉（Sora Katra）的指挥。身体暴力是其专长，但达斯克也涉足非法毒品。",
	"{@b House Tarkanan}. House Tarkanan is known as a small order of highly skilled assassins and thieves in Sharn. Less well known is the fact that this guild consists primarily of criminals who bear aberrant dragonmarks—hence its choice of namesake, as Lord Halas Tarkanan united the bearers of these marks during the ancient War of the Mark.": "{@b House Tarkanan}. 塔卡南家族是沙恩的一个由高技能刺客和盗贼组成的小团体。鲜为人知的是，这个公会主要由带有异常龙纹的罪犯组成--因此它选择了这个名字，因为哈拉斯-塔卡南勋爵在古代的龙纹战争中联合了这些龙纹的持有者。",
	"{@b The Tyrants}. The Tyrants are a mysterious group of shapeshifters who traffic in all manner of information. They sell secrets, blackmail powerful people, and forge everything from identification papers to coins and works of art.": "{@b The Tyrants}. 暴君们是一个神秘的变身者团体，他们贩卖各种信息。他们出售秘密，勒索有权势的人，并伪造从身份证明文件到硬币和艺术品的一切。",
	"{@b Running Your Own}. Rather than join an existing syndicate, you can start your own. You need to establish your own headquarters and direct the activities of the {@dice 3d6} criminals who work for you. By claiming a 15 percent share of their take, you can rely on an income that will sustain you at a modest lifestyle, plus an additional {@dice 1d6} gp in profit per week. You can access contraband and fences as described earlier in this section, but you don't get a discount at syndicate-owned businesses unless you acquire some businesses of your own. You can also use the Running a Business downtime activity to direct the activities of your syndicate.": "{@b Running Your Own}. 与其加入一个现有的辛迪加，你可以开始你自己的。你需要建立自己的总部，并指导为你工作的（1%）罪犯的活动。通过索取他们15%的份额，你可以依靠收入来维持你适度的生活方式，再加上每周额外的{@dice 1d6}金币的利润。你可以像本节前面描述的那样获得违禁品和栅栏，但你在集团所有的企业中得不到折扣，除非你自己收购一些企业。你也可以使用 \"经营企业 \"的停工活动来指导你的辛迪加集团的活动。",
	"Your group works for one of the most influential organizations in Khorvaire: the dragonmarked houses. Whether or not any member of your group carries a dragonmark or is even related to one of the houses by blood, you act on behalf of a house to advance its interests. You might function openly as representatives of the house, wearing its badge and exerting its authority, or you could be covert or unacknowledged agents.": "你们的团体为霍尔韦尔最有影响力的组织之一工作：有龙纹的家族。无论你的团队中是否有成员带着龙纹，甚至是否与某个家族有血缘关系，你都代表某个家族行事，以促进其利益。你们可以作为该家族的代表公开运作，佩戴其徽章并行使其权力，或者你们可以是秘密的或不被承认的代理人。",
	"The thirteen dragonmarked houses are described in detail earlier in this chapter.": "本章前面详细介绍了这十三座龙纹屋。",
	"With a dragonmarked house as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:": "如果有一个龙纹屋作为你的团体的守护者，你会获得以下好处。",
	"{@b Compensation}. Your patron house pays you for the work you do on its behalf. On average, the house pays each member of your group an amount equal to 10 gp × the average level of your characters per day you spend on the mission.": "{@b Compensation}. 你的庇护所为你所做的工作支付你。平均来说，家族会支付给你们每个成员一笔相当于10GP×你们的角色平均等级的金额，每一天你们都会花在任务上。",
	"{@b House Services}. When you require the services provided by your patron house, you can secure them at a discounted rate (10 percent off the normal charge). You might also be able to trade in a favor to get extraordinary services or a larger discount.": "{@b House Services}. 当你需要你的主顾家提供的服务时，你可以以折扣价（正常收费的10%）来保证他们。你也许还可以用人情来换取非凡的服务或更大的折扣。",
	"{@b Independence}. Each member of your group is issued papers that identifies you as agents of your patron house. Because the dragonmarked houses are bound to political neutrality by the terms of the ancient Korth Edicts, these papers guarantee you the right to travel freely across national borders on the business of your patron house. (If you assert that you are on the business of the house, even if you aren't, border agents are unlikely to challenge you.)": "{@b Independence}. 你们小组的每个成员都会获得证件，以表明你们是你们守护家族的代理人。因为有龙纹的家族受古老的科思法令条款的约束而保持政治中立，这些证件保证你有权为你的守护家族的业务而自由穿越国境。 如果你声称你是为家族的业务而来，即使你不是，边境人员也不可能质疑你。",
	"Dragonmarked houses employ adventurers who suit their needs. The roles characters play in a group with a dragonmarked house patron often have more to do with their relationship to the house than with the specific roles in the party. Consider some or all of these roles for your characters:": "龙纹屋雇用适合他们需要的冒险者。角色在有龙纹屋守护者的团体中所扮演的角色往往与他们与龙纹屋的关系有关，而不是与派对中的具体角色有关。你可以考虑为你的角色设置一些或所有这些角色。",
	"{@b Adventurer}. Some characters are associated with your patron house because of their connection to its ruling family or its businesses. The Adventurer, though, is hired by the house for more traditional adventuring skills—usually capabilities that the house's other agents lack. The Adventurer might have a wide range of abilities, particular to whatever needs the House has at the time. Many with peculiar skills or highly specific fields of expertise find themselves in the employ of dragonmarked houses or house members with eccentric interests and deep pockets.": "{@b Adventurer}. 有些角色与你的守护家族有关，因为他们与该家族的统治者或其企业有联系。不过，冒险家受雇于该家族是为了获得更多传统的冒险技能--通常是该家族的其他代理人所缺乏的能力。冒险家可能拥有广泛的能力，特别是满足家族当时的任何需求。许多拥有奇特技能或高度具体的专业领域的人发现自己受雇于有龙纹的家族或拥有古怪兴趣和深厚财力的家族成员。",
	"{@b Guilder}. Every dragonmarked house is more than a single family. Each house encompasses at least one guild that operates just like a traditional craft or trade guild, and hundreds of people associate with these guilds while having no other relationship to the houses that oversee them. The Guilder is among these, perhaps being a skilled physician or cleric in House Jorasco's Healers Guild, for example, or an inquisitive associated with House Tharashk's Finders Guild. The Guilder might have the guild artisan background or some other set of skills suited to the specialties of your patron house's guilds.": "{@b Guilder}. 每个龙纹屋都不只是一个单一的家庭。每个家族至少有一个公会，其运作方式就像传统的手工业或贸易公会一样，有数百人与这些公会有联系，而与监督它们的家族没有其他关系。行会成员就是其中之一，比如说，他可能是乔拉斯科家族治疗师公会的一名熟练医生或牧师，或者是与塔拉什克家族的发现者公会有关的一名好奇者。行会成员可能有公会工匠的背景，或者其他一些适合你的守护家族的公会专长的技能。",
	"{@b Heir}. The Heir is a member of your dragonmarked house patron, related by blood and carrying the house name. This character most likely chooses the race that matches the bloodline of the house. The Heir can be dragonmarked (with the appropriate marked subrace or racial variant) or unmarked. The house agent background (described in this chapter) proves particularly appropriate for this character.": "{@b Heir}. 继承人是你的龙纹家族守护者的成员，有血缘关系，并带有家族的名字。这个角色很可能选择与家族血统相匹配的种族。继承人可以是龙纹（有适当的龙纹亚种或种族变体）或无龙纹。家族代理人的背景（在本章中描述）被证明特别适合这个角色。",
	"Your group and your DM should decide together which house employs you. The nature of the missions you undertake depends in part on the house or guild you work for, but there are general categories of work that every house needs agents to perform on its behalf. The House Missions table provides suggestions for which house might employ you along with multiple possibilities for adventures that overlap with their interests. For the more general kind of work you might carry out on behalf of any dragonmarked house, consult the General House Missions table.": "你的小组和你的DM应该一起决定哪个家族雇用你。你所承担的任务的性质部分取决于你为之工作的家族或公会，但每个家族都需要代理人代表它完成一些一般的工作。家族任务表提供了关于哪个家族可能雇用你的建议，以及与他们的兴趣相重合的多种冒险的可能性。关于你可能代表任何龙纹家族进行的更一般的工作，请参考一般家族任务表。",

	"Reports emerged this week of bitter disputes within the Twelve, the arcane institution that supposedly embodies the spirit of cooperation among the houses. According to a source that wished to remain anonymous, a special meeting of the Committee of Twelve was called last week to address accusations that researchers connected to House Kundarak had been diverting funds from the institute's budget to fund their own private projects, then concealing the results of those projects from their colleagues. Kundarak's representative, according to our source, denied the accusations, saying that the researchers are operating within their allotted budget and keeping their results secret only temporarily, as a matter of house security.": "本周出现了关于十二宫内部激烈争论的报告，十二宫是一个神秘的机构，据称体现了各宫之间的合作精神。据一位不愿透露姓名的消息人士称，上周十二院委员会召开了一次特别会议，以解决与昆达拉克家族有关的研究人员从研究所的预算中挪用资金来资助他们自己的私人项目，然后向他们的同事隐瞒这些项目的结果。据我们的消息来源称，昆达拉克的代表否认了这些指控，说研究人员是在其分配的预算范围内运作的，只是为了房子的安全而暂时对他们的结果保密。",
	"This matter is far from resolved, as the council meeting devolved into shouted arguments before disbanding. Representatives of House Medani and House Tharashk were particularly vocal in denouncing Kundarak, leaving this reporter to wonder whether a schism within the Council of Twelve might be imminent—and what that might mean for peaceful relations among the dragonmarked houses themselves.": "这件事远没有得到解决，因为理事会会议在解散前演变成了大喊大叫的争论。梅丹妮家族和塔拉什克家族的代表在谴责昆达拉克时特别大声，让本报记者怀疑十二人理事会内部的分裂是否迫在眉睫--这对有龙纹的家族之间的和平关系可能意味着什么。",
	"The Twelve facilitates communication and cooperation among the dragonmarked houses. As part of the agreements that ended the War of the Mark, the houses agreed to create an institute for the application of magic—a foundation that would study dragonmarks, along with more traditional forms of magic. Over the centuries, the Twelve has been responsible for many magical advances, including the airships operated by House Lyrandar and the message stations of House Sivis": "十二院促进了龙纹家族之间的交流与合作。作为结束龙纹战争的协议的一部分，各家族同意创建一个魔法应用研究所--一个研究龙纹和更多传统形式的魔法的基金会。几个世纪以来，十二院一直负责许多魔法方面的进步，包括利兰达家族运营的飞艇和西维斯家族的信息站。",
	"As an arm of the dragonmarked houses, the Twelve attempted to remain neutral during the Last War, but many of its wizards and artificers had national loyalties that were stronger than their ties to the institute. Now that the Twelve has resumed normal operations, it seeks to replace its lost members and make sure that each house is represented.": "作为龙纹家族的一个分支，十二星座试图在最后的战争中保持中立，但它的许多巫师和工匠的国家忠诚度比他们与学院的关系更强。现在，十二院已经恢复了正常的运作，它试图取代其失去的成员，并确保每个家族都有代表。",
	"While the Twelve provides a way for your group to work for multiple dragonmarked houses, its goals and benefits are similar to those of an individual house. Consider using the following details as a template if there's a particular dragonmarked house you wish to serve.": "虽然十二宫为你的团体提供了一种为多个龙纹屋工作的方式，但其目标和利益与单个龙纹屋相似。如果有一个特定的龙纹屋是你希望服务的，可以考虑使用下面的细节作为模板。",
	"As a patron, the Twelve is functionally similar to a dragonmarked house. Rather than advancing one house's interests, though, the Twelve seeks to advance magical developments that have practical value to society as well as potential for profit. All the houses contribute to the operating budget of the institute, and in theory they all benefit from the results of its research.": "作为一个赞助人，十二宫在功能上类似于一个有龙纹的家族。不过，十二宫并不是为了促进某个家族的利益，而是为了推动对社会有实际价值的魔法发展，以及潜在的利润。所有家族都为研究所的运营预算做出贡献，理论上他们都能从研究所的研究成果中获益。",
	"As agents of the Twelve, you might undertake missions intended to help one house at a time or all of them at once, typically with a focus on magical research or problem-solving. Members of your group might have different status within their houses, but within the Twelve you're held as equals. The Twelve pay you (see \"{@book Patron Benefits|ERLW|4|Patron Benefits}\"), and as their agents, you receive a 5 percent discount on services from all the dragonmarked houses (rather than a 10 percent discount from one house).": "作为十二宫的代理人，你们可能会承担任务，一次帮助一个家族，或者同时帮助所有的家族，通常以魔法研究或解决问题为重点。你们小组的成员在他们的家族中可能有不同的地位，但在十二宫中你们是平等的。十二家族会付给你们报酬（见\"（%0%）\"），而作为他们的代理人，你们可以从所有龙纹家族获得5%的服务折扣（而不是从一个家族获得10%的折扣）。",
	"The Committee of Twelve oversees the institute. It currently has fifteen members, though its membership is a matter of significant disagreement within the council. There are of course only twelve dragonmarks, but the Mark of Shadow is represented by two different houses, and House Cannith is currently fragmented into three branches, each of which has claimed a seat on the council.": "十二人委员会负责监督该机构。它目前有15名成员，但其成员组成在理事会内部存在重大分歧。当然只有十二个龙印，但影子印记由两个不同的家族代表，坎尼斯家族目前被分割成三个分支，每个分支都在委员会中占有一个席位。",
	"The Twelve is headquartered in a many-spired keep that floats in the air above the city of Korth in Karrnath. Most researchers funded by the Twelve operate within this structure, but the institute occasionally pays grants to researchers whose promising work can't easily (or safely) be relocated inside the keep.": "十二院的总部设在卡尔纳特的科思市上空的一个有很多图案的堡垒里。大多数由十二星座资助的研究人员都在这个结构内工作，但研究所偶尔也会向那些有前途的工作不能轻易（或安全）地在堡垒内重新安置的研究人员支付补助金。",
	"With a long record of providing benefit to society at large, the Twelve is widely respected. Some of their closest allies include the following groups:": "由于长期以来为整个社会提供利益的记录，十二门徒会受到广泛尊重。他们的一些最亲密的盟友包括以下团体。",
	"{@b Dragonmarked Houses}. Above all, the Twelve has the almost universal support of the dragonmarked houses, which provide the funding to support its continued operation. One of the few things that all the houses agree on is that the Twelve should be allowed to do its work in peace. Agents of the Twelve can count on at least a minimal level of assistance from the houses in case of dire need.": "{@b Dragonmarked Houses}. 最重要的是，\"十二门徒会 \"几乎得到了有龙纹的家族的普遍支持，他们提供资金支持其继续运作。所有家族都同意的少数几件事之一是，应该允许十二宫和平地开展工作。十二宫的代理人在有迫切需要的情况下，至少可以指望得到各宫的最低程度的援助。",
	"{@b King Kaius}. Not every nation shares the same goodwill toward the Twelve, but the institutes's location above the city of Korth makes its relationship with Karrnath particularly important. The kings of Karrnath have regularly sought council from the Twelve, and Kaius has not abandoned this practice. Agents of Karrnath's government are inclined to trust agents of the Twelve and side with them in times of trouble.": "{@b King Kaius}. 并非每个国家都对十二门徒有同样的好感，但研究所位于科思城的上方，这使得它与卡尔纳特的关系特别重要。卡尔纳斯的国王经常向十二院寻求意见，凯厄斯也没有放弃这种做法。卡尔纳斯政府的代理人倾向于信任十二星座的代理人，并在遇到困难时与他们站在一起。",
	"{@b Manifest Institute}. In the city of Sharn, the Twelve sponsors the research of a number of scholars who make a study of the manifest zone that links the city to the plane of Syrania. Loosely organized as the Manifest Institute, these researchers include representatives from House Cannith, House Lyrandar, House Orien, and others, as well as those who work directly for the Twelve. The institute evaluates ways that the manifest zone might improve life in Sharn, seeks a deeper understanding of manifest zones in general, and plans contingencies in the event that the manifest zone ever evaporates.": "{@b Manifest Institute}. 在沙恩市，十二星座赞助了一些学者的研究，他们对连接该市和西拉尼亚平面的显形区进行研究。这些研究人员被松散地组织为 \"显灵研究所\"，其中包括来自坎尼斯家族、利兰达家族、奥瑞恩家族和其他家族的代表，以及直接为十二星座工作的人。研究所评估了显露区可以改善沙恩生活的方式，寻求对显露区的更深入了解，并计划在显露区消失的情况下的应急措施。",
	"Most enemies of the Twelve are individuals with grudges against the institute, which often stem from hurt feelings over being excluded from it. Those noted here number among the Twelve's fiercest foes:": "十二门徒会的大多数敌人都是对该机构心怀怨恨的人，这些怨恨往往来自于被排除在该机构之外的伤感。这里提到的人是十二门徒会最凶恶的敌人之一。",
	"{@b Arcane Congress}. Established by King Galifar I expressly to serve as a political answer to the Twelve, the Arcane Congress competes with the Twelve over resources and students. Some would argue that the ongoing rivalry encourages both institutions toward more and better arcane discoveries, but the animosity sometimes escalates to sabotage and researchers taking excessive risks.": "{@b Arcane Congress}. 由加里法尔一世国王建立的奥术大会在政治上是对十二宫的回应，它与十二宫在资源和学生方面存在竞争。有些人认为，这种持续的竞争鼓励两个机构朝着更多、更好的奥术发现前进，但这种敌意有时会升级为破坏行为和研究人员的过度冒险。",
	"{@b Mordain the Fleshweaver}. Not many personal grudges jeopardize the Twelve, but when a powerful wizard feels slighted, the impact can be significant. The elf wizard Mordain was banished from the Twelve more than two centuries ago because of his disturbing experiments related to the magic of the daelkyr. He dwells in Droaam now, focused on his research and plotting revenge. His reach isn't long, but agents of the Twelve avoid Droaam if at all possible.": "{@b Mordain the Fleshweaver}. 没有多少个人恩怨会危害到十二宫，但当一个强大的巫师感到被轻视时，其影响可能会很大。两个多世纪前，精灵巫师莫尔丹被放逐出十二宫，因为他做了与达尔凯尔魔法有关的令人不安的实验。他现在住在德罗阿姆，专注于他的研究并谋划着复仇。他的势力范围并不长，但十二神族的代理人尽可能地避开德罗阿姆。",
	"Secret agents, spies, undercover operatives—your group is part of an organization engaged in espionage. Most such agencies are attached to governments or dragonmarked houses, gathering information on the activities and plans of rival nations, houses, and businesses. Naturally, your affiliation with an espionage agency is a secret; you can't advertise that connection, and if you get in trouble with law enforcement forces (especially in foreign nations), your home nation will disavow you and deny any knowledge of your activities.": "秘密特工、间谍、卧底特工--你的团队是从事间谍活动的组织的一部分。大多数这样的机构都隶属于政府或有龙纹的家族，收集关于敌对国家、家族和企业的活动和计划的信息。自然，你与间谍机构的关系是一个秘密；你不能宣传这种关系，如果你遇到执法部队的麻烦（尤其是在外国），你的祖国会否认你，并否认知道你的活动。",
	"It's said the Last War was fought as much by spies as by armies. Espionage agencies in every nation sought secrets to bring military supremacy to their own lands and provide dominance over their neighbors. In the years since the end of the war, a clandestine struggle among these agencies (which the {@i Korranberg Chronicle} dubbed the Shadow War) has continued unabated, just outside of the public eye.": "据说，最后一场战争是由间谍和军队一样进行的。每个国家的间谍机构都在寻求秘密，以便将军事优势带到自己的土地上，并对其邻国提供支配地位。在战争结束后的几年里，这些机构之间的秘密斗争（%0%）被称为影子战争）有增无减，只是在公众视野之外。",
	"The King's Dark Lanterns is the intelligence division of the King's Citadel, an organization sworn to defend Breland from its enemies and dispense justice in the name of King Boranel. As the secret servants of the crown, members of the organization are granted the authority to conduct intelligence operations on foreign soil, execute covert missions across the globe, and prevent national secrets from falling into the hands of rival intelligence agencies. The Dark Lanterns also have an unwritten license to eliminate any creature that threatens their nation, its sovereign, or its citizens.": "国王的黑灯笼是国王城堡的情报部门，该组织发誓要从敌人手中保卫布雷兰，并以博拉内尔国王的名义执行正义。作为王室的秘密仆人，该组织的成员被授权在外国领土上开展情报行动，在全球范围内执行秘密任务，并防止国家机密落入敌对情报机构的手中。黑暗灯笼也有一个不成文的许可，可以消灭任何威胁到他们国家、其主权或其公民的生物。",
	"The King's Citadel is based in Breland's capital city of Wroat, under the command of the king's brother, Lord Kor ir'Wynarn. A changeling named Captain Vron serves as the leader of the Dark Lanterns, with four subordinate knights marshal leading branch offices across Breland, in Sharn, Starilaskur, and Xandrar. A much smaller branch office keeps an eye on Brelish interests in the city of Stormreach, in Xen'drik. Small, temporary field offices are sometimes established to coordinate missions outside Breland; these offices double as safe houses for agents in trouble, and they are designed to be wiped clean at a moment's notice if discovered by local authorities.": "国王的城堡位于布雷兰的首都沃鲁特，由国王的弟弟科尔-伊尔'维纳恩勋爵指挥。一位名叫弗隆（Vron）上尉的变种人担任黑暗之灯的首领，四位下属骑士负责领导布雷兰在沙恩、斯塔拉斯库尔和桑德拉的分支办事处。在Xen'drik的Stormreach市，有一个小得多的分支办公室，负责监视布瑞利什的利益。有时也会设立一些小型的、临时的外地办事处，以协调布瑞尔大陆以外的任务；这些办事处同时也是陷入困境的特工的安全屋，如果被当地政府发现，它们可以在第一时间被清除掉。",
	"The Sharn office of the King's Citadel is in Andith Tower in the Ambassador Towers district. Though a knight marshal commands the office, most of the King's Citadel members in Sharn are Dark Lanterns, and thus under the authority of a scheming and ruthless gnome named Talleon Haliar Tonan.": "国王城堡的沙恩办公室位于大使塔区的安迪斯塔内。虽然有一位骑士元帅指挥该办公室，但沙恩的大部分国王城堡成员都是黑暗灯笼，因此受一个名叫塔利昂-哈利亚尔-托南的阴谋家的管辖。",
	"The King's Dark Lanterns includes more than 500 agents operating within Breland's borders and roughly one-fifth that number stationed abroad. They often work in teams, and also work closely with the other divisions of the Citadel. Sometimes they recruit local talent, often under false pretenses, to help them accomplish their missions in foreign lands.": "国王的黑暗灯笼包括500多名在布雷兰境内活动的特工，大约有五分之一的特工驻扎在国外。他们经常以团队形式工作，也与城堡的其他部门紧密合作。有时他们会招募当地的人才，通常是以虚假的借口，帮助他们完成在外国的任务。",
	"By their nature, espionage agencies must be cautious in choosing their allies, and the King's Dark Lanterns is no exception. Its most trustworthy allies include the following facets of the Brelish government:": "就其性质而言，间谍机构在选择其盟友时必须谨慎，国王的黑暗灯笼也不例外。它最值得信赖的盟友包括布雷利什政府的以下方面。",
	"{@b King Boranel}. The King's Dark Lanterns, as one would expect, serve the king of Breland, and he is their greatest advocate and ally. The king views loyalty as mutual: as long as an agent's loyalty is irreproachable, Boranel is willing to exercise his considerable power on that agent's behalf.": "{@b King Boranel}. 国王的黑暗灯笼，正如人们所期望的那样，为布雷兰德的国王服务，他是他们最大的支持者和盟友。国王认为忠诚是相互的：只要特工的忠诚是无可指责的，博拉内尔就愿意为该特工行使他的巨大权力。",
	"{@b The King's Citadel}. The Citadel has three branches besides the Dark Lanterns. The King's Swords are elite special combat forces. The King's Shields protect the king and his closest family members and associates. The King's Wands provide magical support to the other branches of the Citadel as well as other Brelish forces. Some Dark Lanterns might think themselves superior to members of the other branches, but even so they recognize other Citadel agents as players on the same team. When your group needs a little extra help, the other branches of the Citadel are there for you.": "{@b The King's Citadel}. 除了黑暗灯笼，城堡还有三个分支。国王之剑是精锐的特种作战部队。国王之盾保护国王和他最亲密的家人和伙伴。国王的魔杖为城堡的其他分支以及其他布雷利什部队提供魔法支持。一些黑灯侠可能会认为自己比其他分支的成员高明，但即便如此，他们也会承认其他城主府特工是同一团队的成员。当你的团队需要一点额外的帮助时，城堡的其他分支就在你身边。",
	"Rare is the espionage agency that is loved. Even within Breland, the populace views the Dark Lanterns with suspicion, and powerful people outside the royal family harbor resentment at the influence of the Citadel. Many people and institutions outside Breland view the Dark Lanterns as a hostile force. As a result, the following groups account for just a few enemies of the Dark Lanterns:": "罕见的是，间谍机构受到了喜爱。即使在布雷兰内部，民众也以怀疑的眼光看待黑暗之灯，而皇室以外的有权势的人则对城堡的影响力怀有怨恨。布雷兰德之外的许多人和机构将黑暗之灯视为一种敌对势力。因此，以下团体只占黑暗之灯的少数敌人。",
	"{@b Brelish Populists}. As much as King Boranel is loved in his country, many Brelish voices argue that the era of monarchy is at an end, and the throne of Breland should be replaced by a government democratically elected by the citizenry. When these forces grow restless enough to plot and riot, the Citadel—and often the Dark Lanterns—work to bring them to heel. As a result, those who question the authority of the king are the most likely Brelish citizens to mistrust the Dark Lanterns or view them with open hostility. According to rumor some of those people even hold high positions in the Brelish government.": "{@b Brelish Populists}. 尽管博拉内尔国王在他的国家里备受爱戴，但许多布雷利什人认为君主制的时代已经结束，布雷兰的王位应该由公民民主选举的政府所取代。当这些势力不安分地策划和骚乱时，城堡--通常是黑暗灯笼--就会努力将他们置于死地。因此，那些质疑国王权威的人是最有可能不信任黑暗灯笼的布雷利什公民，或者对他们抱有公开敌意。据传言，其中一些人甚至在布雷利什政府中担任高级职务。",
	"{@b Foreign Nations}. Every nation knows the King's Dark Lanterns serves as an espionage force and do their best to track the movements of Dark Lantern agents within their borders. Foreign governments treat Dark Lantern agents with care to avoid sparking an international incident, but they are quick to arrest Dark Lantern agents suspected of wrongdoing.": "{@b Foreign Nations}. 每个国家都知道国王的黑暗灯笼作为一支间谍部队，并尽力追踪黑暗灯笼特工在其境内的行动。外国政府谨慎对待黑暗灯笼特工，以避免引发国际事件，但他们会迅速逮捕涉嫌犯错的黑暗灯笼特工。",
	"{@b New Cyre}. One of the world's largest concentrations of Cyran refugees settled in eastern Breland under the leadership of Oargev ir'Wynarn, the last prince of Cyre. Many voices among the Cyrans, possibly including Oargev himself, call for the establishment of an independent nation in what is now Brelish territory, but Boranel is determined to hold on to every acre of his land. The Dark Lanterns actively infiltrate the Cyran refugee community, rooting out those who would act against the king.": "{@b New Cyre}. 世界上最大的赛伦难民集中地之一，在赛尔的最后一位王子Oargev ir'Wynarn的领导下，定居在布瑞尔东部。在赛尔人中有许多声音，可能包括奥格夫本人，呼吁在现在的布雷利什领土上建立一个独立的国家，但博拉内尔决心守住他的每一亩土地。黑暗灯笼积极渗透到锡兰难民社区，将那些反对国王的人连根拔起。",
	"You gain the following benefits when your group's patron is an espionage agency:": "当你的团体的赞助人是一个间谍机构时，你获得以下好处。",
	"{@b Assignments}. Your agency might assign you specific tasks at any time, at the DM's discretion. You have wide latitude regarding how you carry out a task, and your assignments can sometimes be very broad and require considerable time to complete.": "{@b Assignments}. 你的机构可能在任何时候给你分配具体的任务，由管理部决定。你在如何执行任务方面有很大的自由度，你的任务有时可能非常广泛，需要相当长的时间来完成。",
	"{@b Expense Account}. You have access to an account maintained at the banks of House Kundarak. You can use this account to pay your daily living expenses, as well as for purchasing anything you need for completing your missions—equipment, transportation, bribes, and so on. Your normal spending limit is 100 gp per month for each member of your group. If you exceed that, your agency asks you to account for the month's expenses, and they might require you to pay back the excess if you can't justify it (at the DM's discretion). You can't carry over an unused amount from one month to the next, and your access to this account can be cut off at any time if you abuse it or fall out of the agency's good graces. The agency is aware of every time you access the account and where you are when you do so.": "{@b Expense Account}. 你可以使用昆达拉克家族银行的一个账户。你可以用这个账户来支付你的日常生活费用，以及购买你完成任务所需的任何东西--设备、交通、贿赂等等。你的正常消费限额是你的小组每个成员每月100戈比。如果你超过了这个限额，你的机构就会要求你说明这个月的开支，如果你不能说明理由，他们可能会要求你偿还超出的部分（由管理员决定）。你不能将未使用的金额从一个月结转到下一个月，而且如果你滥用这个账户或失去了机构的好感，你对这个账户的使用权随时可能被切断。该机构知道你每次进入该账户的情况，以及你这样做时的位置。",
	"{@b Identification}. Your agency provides you with identification papers establishing your true identity, and you also have ready access to false papers and matching travel documents showing different identities, when you need them for a mission. (Any time you enter a foreign nation, it is a good idea for you to do so under a false identity.)": "{@b Identification}. 你的机构为你提供确定你真实身份的身份证件，当你执行任务需要时，你也可以随时获得显示不同身份的假证件和匹配的旅行文件。(任何时候你进入一个外国，用一个假的身份是一个好主意）。",
	"{@b Powerful Friends}. An espionage agency, by nature, has a long reach and a lot of power to make things happen behind the scenes. You can call in a favor for a wide range of benefits: A legal case against you might be suddenly dropped. A rival might disappear. A much-needed magic item might be delivered to you. These favors can provide significant short-term benefit, but they can also come with equally significant long-term repercussions—which might lead to entirely new missions.": "{@b Powerful Friends}. 一个间谍机构，就其性质而言，具有很强的影响力和很大的权力，可以在幕后使事情发生。你可以叫人帮忙，获得广泛的利益。一个针对你的法律案件可能突然被撤销。一个对手可能会消失。一个急需的魔法物品可能会被送到你手中。这些人情可以提供重要的短期利益，但它们也可以带来同样重要的长期影响--这可能会导致全新的任务。",
	"Espionage agents are typically both highly trained and tightly specialized. The type of missions you undertake can shape your group's composition; you might be a team of hunters or investigators, focused on tracking people down or gathering information. More likely, you're a diverse team with a range of skills that allow you undertake a variety of different missions on your patron's behalf. Consider some or all of these roles for the characters in your party:": "间谍人员通常都是训练有素的，而且专业性很强。你所承担的任务类型可以塑造你的团队的组成；你可能是一个猎人或调查员的团队，专注于追踪人或收集信息。更有可能的是，你们是一个多样化的团队，拥有一系列的技能，可以代表你的赞助人承担各种不同的任务。考虑为你的队伍中的角色设置一些或所有这些角色。",
	"{@b Chameleon}. A master of disguise, sleight of hand, and deception, the Chameleon can perform the work of the Investigator or a Confiscator right under a target's nose—or provide cover to agents with different specialties as they do their jobs. A high Charisma, proficiency with the disguise kit (or access to spells that cloak or disguise one's appearance), and proficiency with skills such as {@skill Deception}, {@skill Performance}, and {@skill Sleight of Hand} all greatly benefit the Chameleon. Bards and rogues, as well as characters with the charlatan, entertainer, or urchin background, often excel in this role.": "{@b Chameleon}. 变色龙是伪装、诡计和欺骗的大师，他可以在目标的眼皮底下完成调查员或没收者的工作--或者为不同专业的特工在工作中提供掩护。高的魅力、对伪装工具的熟练掌握（或使用能掩盖或伪装自己外表的法术），以及对{@skill Deception}、{@skill Performance}和{@skill Sleight of Hand}等技能的熟练掌握，都对变色龙大有好处。吟游诗人和无赖，以及具有江湖郎中、艺人或顽童背景的人物，往往擅长这个角色。",
	"In a courthouse surrounded by agents of the King's Citadel and thronged by reporters, judge Haliss ir'Cronn took her seat for the first session in what some are calling the \"trial of the century.\"": "在一个被国王城堡的代理人包围并被记者簇拥的法院里，法官Haliss ir'Cronn在一些人称之为 \"世纪审判 \"的第一次会议上就座。",
	"Barath Drinn, a Karrn who has been living in Wroat since the end of the Last War, stands accused of stealing state secrets, sabotage, and one count of murder—though an anonymous source suggests that he is guilty of many more killings.": "巴拉斯-德林（Barath Drinn）是一个自最后一次战争结束后一直居住在沃洛特的卡恩人，他被指控窃取国家机密、进行破坏，并被指控犯有一项谋杀罪--尽管一个匿名消息来源表明，他还犯有许多谋杀罪。",
	"A spokesperson for the King's Citadel vehemently denied reports that Drinn is employed by the Citadel.": "国王城堡的一位发言人坚决否认关于德林受雇于城堡的报道。",
	"{@b Confiscator}. Sometimes an espionage agency needs something stolen—a document that incriminates a public figure to a prototype war machine. The Confiscator has the key skills for such jobs. A good Dexterity score proves helpful in undertaking such tasks, especially if it's enhanced with proficiency with thieves' tools and the {@skill Sleight of Hand} and {@skill Stealth} skills. Confiscators are often rogues, and many have a history of stealing for profit rather than national interest.": "{@b Confiscator}. 有时，一个间谍机构需要一些被盗的东西--将一个公众人物归罪于一个战争机器原型的文件。没收者拥有这种工作的关键技能。一个好的灵巧分数在执行这些任务时是有帮助的，特别是当它被熟练地使用盗贼工具和（1%）和（2%）技能时。没收者通常是流氓，许多人都有为了利润而不是国家利益而偷窃的历史。",
	"{@b Hunter}. The Hunter stalks humanoid prey, for purposes of assassination, abduction, or gathering information. A combination of combat prowess with stealth and interaction skills makes for well-prepared Hunters. Rangers and rogues prove particularly adept at this role, as might anyone with proficiency in the {@skill Investigation}, {@skill Perception} and {@skill Stealth} skills. A high Charisma and proficiency in {@skill Deception}, {@skill Intimidation}, and {@skill Persuasion} skills can also be useful. Hunters often come from backgrounds such as outlander or urchin.": "{@b Hunter}. 猎人跟踪类人猎物，以达到暗杀、绑架或收集信息的目的。战斗能力与隐蔽性和互动技能的结合使得猎人准备充分。游侠和流氓特别擅长这个角色，任何精通（1%）、（2%）和（3%）技能的人也是如此。高的魅力和精通（%4%）、（%5%）和（%6%）的技能也是有用的。猎人通常来自外乡人或顽童等背景。",
	"{@b Investigator}. The Investigator is the archetypal spy, a master of deductive reasoning and suave interaction. Naturally, {@skill Investigation} can be a crucial skill, which many characters in this role combine with magical means of scrying to learn about their enemies and objectives. Bards and wizards make natural Investigators, especially if they can acquire one or more skills from among {@skill Deception}, {@skill Perception}, {@skill Persuasion}, and {@skill Stealth}. Investigators come from backgrounds as varied as charlatans, nobles, sages, and urchins.": "{@b Investigator}. 调查员是典型的间谍，是演绎推理和风趣互动的大师。当然，{@skill Investigation}可以是一个重要的技能，许多扮演这个角色的人物将其与窥探的魔法手段相结合，以了解他们的敌人和目标。吟游诗人和巫师是天然的调查员，特别是如果他们能从（2%）、（3%）、（4%）和（5%）中获得一个或多个技能。调查员的背景各不相同，有的是江湖郎中，有的是贵族，有的是圣人，有的是顽童。",
	"{@b Operator}. An Operator leads or organizes a team of agents in the field. Like a military officer, the Operator issues orders and bears responsibility for the agents on the team. High Charisma and Intelligence scores help make the Operator a strong leader, especially in conjunction with skill proficiencies such as {@skill Persuasion} and {@skill Investigation}. The wide array of skills used by other agents are also valuable to the Operator, who might end up stepping into a different role when the need arises. The Operator is often a bard and might come from a soldier or noble background (being accustomed to leadership in one form or another).": "{@b Operator}. 接线员领导或组织一个外勤特工小组。像一个军官一样，接线员发布命令并对团队中的特工负责。高的魅力和智力分数有助于使接线员成为一个强有力的领导者，特别是与技能熟练度相结合，如{@skill Persuasion}和{@skill Investigation}。其他特工使用的各种技能对接线员也很有价值，当需要时，他可能最终会进入一个不同的角色。操作员通常是一个吟游诗人，可能来自士兵或贵族背景（习惯于以某种形式进行领导）。",
	"{@b Saboteur}. The Saboteur interferes with the functioning of enemy assets. More than a reckless bomber, they combine a willingness to destroy with a knack for infiltration. Proficiency with thieves' tools and in skills such as {@skill Deception}, {@skill Investigation}, and {@skill Stealth} often serve the work of sabotage. The Saboteur benefits from an understanding of craft and magic items, making artificers particularly skilled in this role. Guild artisans might also disguise tools of destruction as mundane objects or works of art. Many Saboteurs come from backgrounds such as charlatans or soldiers.": "{@b Saboteur}. 破坏者干扰敌方资产的运作。比起鲁莽的轰炸机，他们把破坏的意愿和渗透的技巧结合起来。熟练掌握盗贼工具和技能，如(1%)、(2%)和(3%)，常常为破坏工作服务。破坏者得益于对工艺和魔法物品的理解，使工匠们在这个角色中特别熟练。行会的工匠们也可能将破坏工具伪装成世俗物品或艺术品。许多破坏者的背景是江湖术士或士兵。",
	"Espionage activities can be classified in three broad categories: counterintelligence, covert action, and intelligence gathering.

As a group, work with your DM and consult the Espionage Missions table to decide what kinds of missions you might undertake.": "间谍活动可分为三大类：反间谍、秘密行动和情报收集。你的队伍可能专注于其中一个领域，或者你是处理其他队伍所搞砸的情况的队伍。作为一个团体，与你的管理人合作，并参考间谍任务表，以决定你可能承担的任务类型。",

Consult the Memorable Mission table to determine the details of your career-defining exploit.": "你从事的任务至今仍给你的工作蒙上了阴影。那是一次完美的行动，还是你仍然带着因任务出错而留下的伤痕？请参考 \"难忘的任务 \"表，以确定你那决定职业生涯的任务细节。",

Oargev has not forgotten that kindness, and he would prefer not to jeopardize his friendship with Boranel by seizing land from Breland.

They tend to treat Cyran refugees as second-class citizens and vagabonds. Among non-Cyran communities, agents of Prince Oargev can't rely on aid from any of Cyre's former enemies.": "{@b The Five Nations}. 昂代尔人、卡伦人和瑟兰人一般都不同情流离失所的赛兰人的困境。他们中的许多人痛苦地承受着战争的伤痛，他们的怨恨被暴力的赛伦极端分子的行为所强化。即使是布雷利什人，尽管他们一直表现得很冷漠，但在面对赛伦人时也变得小心翼翼，因为赛伦人是他们的领导人强加给他们的负担。他们倾向于将居里安人难民视为二等公民和流浪者。在非居里安社区中，欧格夫王子的代理人不能依靠任何居里安的前敌人的援助。",
	"{@b The Lord of Blades.} In the depths of the Mournland, the closest thing to a sovereign is {@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW}—a heavily enhanced warforged who seeks vengeance against those who created his people to serve as weapons. He is hostile to adventurers who enter the Mournland on missions of plunder, and the idea of Prince Oargev reclaiming the Mournland fills him with fury. He shows Oargev's agents no mercy.": "{@b The Lord of Blades.}在哀伤之地的深处，最接近君主的东西是{@creature the Lord of Blades|ERLW}--一个重度强化的战争锻造者，他要向那些创造他的人民作为武器的人复仇。他对进入哀牢地执行掠夺任务的冒险者充满敌意，而奥格夫王子夺回哀牢地的想法让他充满愤怒。他对Oargev的代理人毫不留情。",
	"With a head of state as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:": "如果有国家元首作为你的团体的赞助人，你会获得以下好处。",
	"Prince Oargev, the exiled Cyran royal who governs the town of New Cyre by the sufferance of King Boranel, is planning a brazen act of secession, hoping to transform all of eastern Breland into a new Cyran realm, sources say. According to a group of adventurers recently employed by Oargev, the prince sent them into the Mournland to recover weapons of war so they could be wielded against the Brelish military during the secession. How will King Boranel respond to this treachery? Will the nations come to the defense of the displaced prince? Will Oargev's scheming result in all of eastern Breland being swathed in the same gray mist that consumed Cyre?": "Oargev王子，被流放的Cyran王族，在Boranel国王的容忍下管理着New Cyre镇，正在计划一个厚颜无耻的分离行为，希望把整个东部Breland变成一个新的Cyran王国，消息来源说。根据奥格夫最近雇佣的一群冒险家的说法，王子派他们进入哀伤之地找回战争武器，以便在分离期间可以用来对付布雷利什的军队。博拉内尔国王将如何应对这种背叛行为？各国会不会来保卫这个流离失所的王子？奥格夫的阴谋是否会导致整个布瑞尔东部被笼罩在吞噬赛尔的灰雾中？",
	"{@b Assignments}. Your work is performed at the direction of your patron. That means you are usually under assignment and not entirely free to choose your own course. Depending on the ruler and the task, these assignments can be directive or more hands-off, as you pursue long-term goals.": "{@b Assignments}. 你的工作是在你的赞助人的指导下进行的。这意味着你通常要接受任务，不能完全自由地选择自己的路线。根据统治者和任务的不同，这些任务可以是指令性的，也可以是更多的放手，因为你要追求长期的目标。",
	"{@b Expenses}. In addition to your salary, your patron reimburses you for extraordinary expenses incurred as part of your work. You are required to account for your expenses and might be called on to explain any extraordinary expenditures, but routine travel, ordinary equipment, and most services don't draw a second glance.": "{@b Expenses}. 除了你的工资，你的赞助人还报销你在工作中发生的特殊费用。你被要求说明你的开支，并可能被要求解释任何特殊开支，但日常旅行、普通设备和大多数服务不会引起人们的注意。",
	"{@b Immunity}. As long as you remain in the head of state's good graces, you are nearly immune to prosecution under the laws of your home country. Committing serious crimes—especially if they are unrelated or unnecessary for the work you've been assigned—is a good way to fall out of your patron's good graces, however. When you are carrying out your orders within your nation's borders, though, you have a great deal of leeway in how you choose to do that, and the law isn't an obstacle. (However, note that agents of Prince Oargev can't necessarily expect the same clemency in Breland outside of New Cyre.)": "{@b Immunity}. 只要你保持在国家元首的好感中，你就几乎不会受到本国法律的起诉。然而，犯下严重的罪行--特别是如果这些罪行与你被指派的工作无关或没有必要--是失去你的赞助人的好感的一个好办法。不过，当你在你的国家边界内执行你的命令时，你有很大的余地来选择如何做，而法律并不是一个障碍。(然而，请注意，在新赛尔之外的布雷兰，奥格夫王子的代理人不一定能指望得到同样的宽恕）。",
	"{@b Salary}. Your employment for a head of state brings you an income of 1 gp per day, or enough to maintain a modest lifestyle. At the DM's discretion, your salary might increase or decrease depending on which particular head of state you work for, the nature of your work, and the length of your employment.": "{@b Salary}. 你为国家元首工作给你带来了每天1戈比的收入，或者说足以维持一个适度的生活。根据DM的决定，你的工资可能会增加或减少，这取决于你为哪个特定的国家元首工作，你的工作性质，以及你工作的时间。",
	"A head of state like Prince Oargev requires a variety of adventurers to do the range of tasks they require. Depending on the kinds of work you do, your party might include some or all of these roles:": "像Oargev王子这样的国家元首需要各种冒险者来完成他们所需要的一系列任务。根据你的工作种类，你的队伍可能包括这些角色中的一部分或全部。",
	"{@b Civil Servant}. The vast majority of work performed on behalf of a head of state has very little to do with deadly adventure: it's about prosecuting and judging criminals in the courts of law, hearing the petitions and complaints of citizens, collecting taxes, and interminable amounts of paperwork. Once in a while, though, a faithful Civil Servant gets forcefully pulled from this work and thrust into life-or-death situations, with or without help from more hardened adventurers. The knowledge and experience of a Civil Servant can often be useful, with some developing skills as clerics, rogues, wizards, or other classes. Such characters often come from the sage background and have proficiency in skills that reflect their studies, such as {@skill Arcana}, {@skill History}, {@skill Nature}, and {@skill Religion}.": "{@b Civil Servant}. 代表国家元首进行的绝大多数工作与致命的冒险关系不大：它是关于在法庭上起诉和审判罪犯，听取公民的请愿和投诉，收税，以及无休止的文书工作。不过，偶尔也会有忠实的公务员被强行从这项工作中拉出来，并被推入生死攸关的境地，不管有没有更强硬的冒险者的帮助。公务员的知识和经验往往是有用的，有些人可以发展为牧师、流氓、巫师或其他类别的技能。这样的角色通常来自于圣人背景，并拥有反映其研究的技能，如（1%）、（2%）、（3%）和（4%）的熟练度。",
	"{@b Diplomat}. Negotiating treaties, de-escalating conflicts, and issuing ultimatums are tasks that fall within the purview of the Diplomat, who typically puts their high Charisma to work in the service of the state. These characters often come from a noble background and bring proficiency in skills such as {@skill Intimidation} and {@skill Persuasion} to their work. Bards are natural fits in this role, as are paladins—as long as they aren't asked to do things that violate the tenets of their oaths.": "{@b Diplomat}. 谈判条约、缓和冲突和发布最后通牒都属于外交官的工作范围，他们通常将自己的高魅力投入到为国家服务的工作中。这些角色通常来自于贵族背景，并在他们的工作中带来熟练的技能，如（1%）和（2%）。吟游诗人是这个角色的自然人选，圣骑士也是如此--只要他们不被要求做违反其誓言的事情。",
	"{@b Marshal}. Combat is the specialty of the Marshal, who focuses on enforcing the law of the land and bringing fugitives to justice. Fighters and paladins make natural Marshals, many being former soldiers who continue fighting the Last War in different venues. They often have reasonable Intelligence scores or proficiency in {@skill Investigation}.": "{@b Marshal}. 战斗是元帅的专长，他专注于执行国家的法律并将逃犯绳之以法。战士和圣骑士是天然的元帅，许多人是前士兵，他们在不同的地方继续为最后的战争而战。他们通常有合理的智力分数或精通（%1%）。",
	"{@b Warden}. The Warden's focus isn't so much on the people of the nation, but on the land encompassed within its borders, both cultivated and wild. Sometimes that extends to protecting the border from incursions, but more often a Warden contend with monstrosities and wild beasts that threaten the populace, magical corruption that harms the land, and disasters jeopardizing the nation as a whole. Wardens are often rangers or druids, with proficiency in {@skill Nature} and {@skill Perception}. They might come from backgrounds as outlanders or hermits, making them more comfortable in the wilds than in cities or royal courts.": "{@b Warden}. 典狱长的工作重点不在于国家的人民，而在于其边界内的土地，包括耕地和荒地。有时，他们会保护边界不被入侵，但更多的时候，典狱长要与威胁民众的怪兽和野兽、危害土地的魔法腐败以及危害整个国家的灾难作斗争。典狱长通常是游侠或德鲁伊，精通（1%）和（2%）。他们可能来自外乡人或隐士的背景，这使得他们在荒野中比在城市或王室法庭中更加自如。",
	"Sometimes there's a fine line between the missions assigned by a head of state and those of an espionage agency or a military force, but your team's central focus is politics. As a group, consult the Cyran Affairs table and work with your DM to decide what kinds of adventures you undertake on behalf of Prince Oargev. The Heads of State table at the end of the section offers additional options for leaders who might make appealing patrons.": "有时，国家元首指派的任务与间谍机构或军事力量的任务之间存在着细微的差别，但你的团队的核心重点是政治。作为一个团队，请参考锡兰事务表，并与你的DM合作，决定你代表奥格夫王子进行什么样的冒险。本节末尾的国家元首表为那些可能成为吸引人的赞助人的领导人提供了额外的选择。",
	"Convince nations to recognize Oargev as a sovereign": "说服各国承认Oargev是一个主权国家",
	"Work diplomatically to secure land for a Cyran nation": "通过外交途径为锡兰国家争取土地",
	"Track down agents and infiltrators from other nations who are acting against New Cyre's interests": "追踪来自其他国家的有损新赛尔利益的特工和渗透者。",

	"Aid Cyran refugees in Breland and elsewhere": "援助在布雷兰德和其他地方的赛伦难民",
	"Make incriminating or embarrassing evidence about the prince quietly disappear": "让有关王子的罪证或令人尴尬的证据悄然消失",
	"Heads of state employ a variety of agents. Some are officially recognized, but others are expected to operate on the borders of legality. Consult the State Status table to determine the nature of your group's work": "国家元首雇用各种代理人。有些是官方承认的，但其他的则是要在合法的边界上运作。请参考国家地位表以确定你的团体的工作性质",
	"{@b Official}. You hold an official position and are recognized as attached to your patron. You can expect the head of state's support, but you must also ensure your actions avoid staining your patron's reputation.": "{@b Official}. 你拥有一个官方职位，并被公认为依附于你的赞助人。你可以期待国家元首的支持，但你也必须确保你的行为避免玷污你赞助人的声誉。",
	"{@b Shadow}. You can expect no official, public recognition of your work, but the head of state you work for does acknowledge you in private and provide help.": "{@b Shadow}. 你可以期望你的工作没有得到官方的、公开的承认，但你工作的国家元首确实在私下里承认你，并提供帮助。",
	"{@b Double}. Your allegiance lies with an official or government other than the one you overtly serve. You may receive support from the head of state you openly answer follow, as well as the official you secretly report to, but must remain on constant guard against having your true loyalties revealed.": "{@b Double}. 你的效忠对象是你公开服务的官员或政府以外的人。你可能会得到你公开效忠的国家元首的支持，以及你秘密报告的官员的支持，但你必须时刻保持警惕，防止你的真实忠诚度被暴露。",
	"Often, your connection to your patron is quite direct—the head of state summons you, grants you an audience, and gives you an assignment or hears your report. Heads of state are busy people, though, and if your business isn't pressing, you might be handled by a functionary of the court. The State Contacts table provides several options for what functionaries your group might work with when the head of state is indisposed.": "通常情况下，你与你的赞助人的联系是非常直接的--国家元首召唤你，准许你觐见，给你一个任务或听取你的报告。不过，国家元首都是大忙人，如果你的事情不急，你可能会被法院的一个官员处理。国家联系表提供了几个选项，当国家元首不在时，你的团体可以与哪些职能部门合作。",
	"A disapproving courtier who finds your extrajudicial work highly distasteful": "一个不赞成的朝臣认为你的法外工作非常令人讨厌",
	"A fawning sycophant who figures you are the best path to the head of state's good graces": "一个认为你是获得国家元首好感的最佳途径的献媚者。",
	"A wide-eyed bureaucrat who dreams of living a life as exciting and dangerous as yours": "一个眼界开阔的官僚，梦想着过上像你一样刺激和危险的生活",

	"The Heads of State table offers suggestions for the kind of work you might do for other national leaders in Khorvaire, if Prince Oargev isn't your patron.": "国家元首表为你在霍尔韦尔为其他国家领导人所做的工作提供了建议，如果Oargev王子不是你的赞助人。",

	"A mysterious figure who appears in lofty myths and children's fables, Sora Kell extends her reach across the world and through the myriad planes, claiming mystical knowledge by force and cunning. A mighty wizard with magic worthy of epic tales, she is a monster whose adamantine claws can flense whole armies before any soldier can land a blow on her plated hide. Tales of Sora Kell claim she is the first night hag, born from Khyber in the first age of the world alongside the ancient rakshasas. Some even claim that her daughters—the hags who rule Droaam—are either direct agents of her will or have trapped her and pursue their own goals.": "作为一个出现在崇高的神话和儿童寓言中的神秘人物，索拉-凯尔将她的触角伸向了整个世界和无数个星球，通过武力和狡猾来索取神秘的知识。她是一个强大的巫师，拥有堪比史诗故事的魔法，她是一个怪物，其金刚般的爪子可以在任何士兵对她的镀金皮进行打击之前就把整支军队打散。关于索拉-凯尔的故事声称她是第一个夜行者，在世界的第一个时代从开伯尔出生，与古老的罗刹人一起。有些人甚至声称她的女儿们--统治Droaam的女巫--要么是她意志的直接代理人，要么是困住了她并追求自己的目标。",
	"One fact is indisputable: Sora Kell is an immortal being who employs mortals to do her bidding. In exchange, she trades lore from her boundless stores of magic items, racks of scrolls, libraries of ancient spells, maps of forgotten ruins, and tomes unveiling the mysteries of the multiverse, which she has secreted away in caches across the planes.": "有一个事实是毋庸置疑的。索拉-凯尔是一个雇佣凡人为她服务的不朽生命。作为交换，她从她无边无际的魔法物品仓库、卷轴架、古代法术图书馆、被遗忘的废墟地图以及揭开多元宇宙之谜的书籍中交换传说，她把这些东西藏在各个星球的仓库里。",
	"Unlike some other immortal patrons, Sora Kell's physical form has not been seen on Eberron for over a century. Perhaps she has set a task before her daughters and watches events unfold. Maybe she is trapped upon another plane of existence or is devising magic that could shake the foundations of existence. In any case, she appears in the dreams of her agents, or occasionally uses magical means to communicate, sometimes directly, other times through sinister omens.": "与其他一些不朽的守护者不同，索拉-凯尔的身体形态已经有一个多世纪没有在Eberron出现了。也许她在她的女儿们面前布置了一个任务，并看着事件的发展。也许她被困在另一个存在平面上，或者正在设计可以动摇存在根基的魔法。在任何情况下，她都会出现在她的代理人的梦中，或者偶尔使用魔法手段进行交流，有时是直接交流，有时是通过险恶的预兆。",
	"As a creature of legend, Sora Kell can hardly be said to have allies, except for a handful of other legends like the following groups:": "作为传说中的生物，索拉-凯尔很难说有盟友，除了少数其他传说中的人，如以下团体。",
	"{@b Daughters of Sora Kell.} Sora Kell's three daughters—the gifted oracle Sora Teraza, the cunning trickster Sora Katra, and the vicious monster Sora Maenya—rule the nation of Droaam, either to facilitate their own scheming or at their mother's command. Adventurers who enjoy the patronage of Sora Kell can impose on her daughters for aid if they should ever find themselves in or near Droaam. They can also count on the aid of Daask, a criminal gang in Sharn, which is controlled by Sora Katra.": "{@b Daughters of Sora Kell.}索拉-凯尔的三个女儿--有天赋的神谕者索拉-泰拉扎、狡猾的诡计家索拉-卡特拉和邪恶的怪物索拉-梅尼亚--统治着德罗阿姆国家，或是为了方便她们自己的阴谋，或是听从她们母亲的命令。享有索拉-凯尔赞助的冒险家们如果发现自己在德罗阿姆或附近，可以向她的女儿们寻求援助。他们也可以指望达斯克的援助，达斯克是沙恩的一个犯罪团伙，由索拉-卡特拉控制。",
	"{@b Lords of Dust}. Ancient fiends number among Sora Kell's allies—not the least of which are her daughters' three long-forgotten fathers. It isn't for Sora Kell's pawns to know which of the powerful villains are friendly to Sora Kell, but she occasionally sends adventurers to lend aid to rakshasas—often lesser fiends working to free the ancient overlords. Wise adventurers carefully weigh the rewards of working with such fiends against the costs—to themselves and the world.": "{@b Lords of Dust}. 在索拉-凯尔的盟友中，古老的恶魔很多--其中最重要的是她女儿的三个早已被遗忘的父亲。索拉-凯尔的卒子不知道哪些强大的恶棍对索拉-凯尔是友好的，但她偶尔会派冒险者向拉卡萨斯提供援助--通常是那些致力于解放古代霸主的较小的恶魔。明智的冒险者会仔细权衡与这些恶魔合作的回报与他们自己和世界的代价。",
	"Like most immortal beings, Sora Kell has many enemies, though the mortal ones barely merit her attention. For the most part, only beings like those that follow dare oppose Sora Kell:": "像大多数不朽的生命一样，索拉-凯尔有许多敌人，尽管凡人几乎不值得她注意。在大多数情况下，只有像后面那些人一样的生命才敢反对索拉-凯尔。",
	"{@b The Dreaming Dark}. In Sora Kell's estimation, the greatest threat to her are the quori of Dal Quor, and their minions, the Dreaming Dark. Fortunately for the adventurers that serve Sora Kell, few mortals register as worthy foes in the alien minds of the quori.": "{@b The Dreaming Dark}. 在索拉-凯尔的估计中，对她最大的威胁是达尔-库尔的科里，以及他们的爪牙--梦中的黑暗。对于为索拉-凯尔服务的冒险者来说，幸运的是，在奎里人的外星思维中，很少有凡人能成为值得尊敬的敌人。",
	"{@b Lords of Dust}. Sora Kell has allies among the Lords of Dust, but she also has bitter rivals. Like the quori, these fiends rarely pay much attention to Sora Kell's mortal minions, but they aren't above harming mortal adventurers just to spite her.": "{@b Lords of Dust}. 索拉-凯尔在尘土领主中拥有盟友，但她也有激烈的对手。像科里一样，这些恶魔很少关注索拉-凯尔的凡人爪牙，但他们也不排除为了报复她而伤害凡人冒险者。",
	"The patronage of an immortal being is a relationship built on favors, not on employment or service. Your group does favors for your patron, and you can ask favors in return. These favors are the benefits you gain for having an immortal being as your group's patron, and they might include any of the following boons:": "不朽者的赞助是一种建立在恩惠上的关系，而不是雇佣或服务。你的团体为你的赞助人提供帮助，而你可以要求对方提供帮助作为回报。这些恩惠是你获得的好处，因为有一个不朽的生命作为你的团体的赞助人，它们可能包括以下任何一种好处。",
	"{@b Contacts}. Your group is almost certainly not the only one sponsored by your patron. Plans that span the world and the course of millennia require many agents to complete. If necessary, your patron can put you in contact with their other agents, who might be in a position to help you through status, influence, or magic.": "{@b Contacts}. 你的团体几乎肯定不是你的赞助人所赞助的唯一团体。跨越世界和千年的计划需要许多代理人来完成。如果有必要，你的赞助人可以让你与他们的其他代理人取得联系，他们可能会通过地位、影响或魔法来帮助你。",
	"{@b Information}. The most precious reward most immortals can give is a tidbit of their ages-spanning knowledge. Immortal beings often know secrets hidden from most mortals—including glimpses of possible futures. They don't usually share secrets freely, but they might reward your group for the completion of a mission with a hint, a puzzle, or a morsel of information that sets you off in pursuit of more.": "{@b Information}. 大多数不朽者能给予的最珍贵的奖赏是他们跨越时代的知识的一个小插曲。不朽的生命往往知道大多数凡人所不知道的秘密--包括对可能的未来的一瞥。他们通常不会随意分享秘密，但他们可能会在你的团队完成任务后给你一个提示，一个谜题，或者一个信息，让你去追求更多的东西。",
	"{@b Magic}. Immortal beings often have access to vast stores of magic, including their own spells and secret caches of magic items. They are mindful of the value of this magic, and grant spells and items as rewards appropriate to the favor and the power of the adventurers.": "{@b Magic}. 不朽的生命通常可以获得大量的魔法储存，包括他们自己的法术和秘密藏匿的魔法物品。他们注意到这些魔法的价值，并给予法术和物品作为与冒险者的恩惠和力量相适应的奖励。",
	"Though it is not a sentient force that can control or reward your party, the Draconic Prophecy can be similar to an Immortal Being patron. The Prophecy can act as a guide for adventurers who seek to fulfill it—or to steer its fulfillment in a particular direction. You stand among the heroes of the present age; surely you have a role to play in the unfolding prophecy.": "虽然它不是一种可以控制或奖励你的队伍的有生命的力量，但德拉贡的预言可以类似于不朽的存在的守护者。预言可以作为寻求实现它的冒险者的向导--或者将它的实现引向一个特定的方向。你站在当今时代的英雄之中；你肯定能在正在展开的预言中扮演一个角色。",
	"In order for the Draconic Prophecy to work as a patron, one or more of the characters needs to have access to words from the Prophecy. Your group might adventure to seek out places where the Prophecy is written: mountainsides and cavern walls, ancient text and crumbling ruins, or the patterns of moons, stars, and the Ring of Siberys (best interpreted at an observatory). A dragonmarked character might gain insight into the Prophecy from the marks on their skin. Alternatively, a character might hear words from the Prophecy in dreams or visions, or surfacing from some deeply buried memory of a traumatic event.": "为了让《德拉贡预言》作为守护者发挥作用，一个或多个角色需要接触到预言中的文字。你的团队可以冒险去寻找写有预言的地方：山坡和洞壁、古老的文字和摇摇欲坠的废墟，或者月亮、星星和西伯利亚之环的图案（最好在天文台解释）。一个有龙纹的角色可能从他们皮肤上的印记中获得对预言的洞察力。另外，一个角色可能会在梦境或幻觉中听到预言的话语，或者从某个深埋的创伤性事件的记忆中浮现出来。",
	"Given access to the words of the Prophecy, it's up to the characters to decide what they mean. The Prophecy is notoriously difficult to interpret, and a given passage might be fulfilled in different ways (or, possibly, in multiple ways over the course of centuries). For example, take a prophetic snippet like the one mentioned in the book's introduction: \"If the Bear King is slain by a sorrowful assassin in the Shadow of the Mourning, the Crown will fall from his nation.\" This might mean that if King Boranel of Breland is killed in the Mournland, the kingdom of Breland will be dissolved, and if dissolving the monarchy is the characters' goal, they can try to bring about those circumstances. On the other hand, it could mean that if an awakened bear in the Eldeen Reaches declares himself king of the forest, and if the bear is killed on the anniversary of the Mourning, the tallest tree in the domain he claimed (the Crown of his nation) will fall. If that is the characters' goal, for whatever reason, they might try to bring those circumstances about.": "在获得了预言的话语后，就由人物来决定它们的含义。预言是出了名的难以解释，某段话可能会以不同的方式实现（或者，可能是在几个世纪的时间里以多种方式实现）。例如，就拿该书导言中提到的一个预言片段来说吧。\"如果熊王在哀伤的阴影中被一个悲伤的刺客杀死，王冠将从他的国家中掉落。\" 这可能意味着，如果布雷兰国王博拉内尔在哀伤之影中被杀，布雷兰王国将被解散，如果解散君主制是人物的目标，他们可以尝试促成这些情况的发生。另一方面，这可能意味着，如果一只在Eldeen Reaches觉醒的熊宣布自己是森林之王，如果这只熊在哀伤纪念日被杀，他所宣称的领域中最高的树（他的国家的王冠）将会倒下。如果这是人物的目标，无论出于什么原因，他们可能会试图使这些情况发生。",
	"The currency of favors that defines most patronage relationships is tricky when your group's patron is a series of vague oracular verses rather than a person. However, bringing about the fulfillment of the Prophecy in a certain way often has immediate or long-term benefits that are equivalent to the favors another patron might grant your group. Toppling the Crown in the Bear King's domain might give you access to a spell inscribed in the ancient tree's rings, for example.": "当你的团体的赞助人是一系列模糊的神谕诗句而不是一个人时，定义大多数赞助关系的恩惠货币就很棘手。然而，以某种方式实现预言往往会带来直接或长期的好处，这些好处相当于另一个赞助人可能给予你的团体的恩惠。例如，推翻熊王领域的王冠可能会让你获得刻在古树年轮上的咒语。",
	"No common thread unites adventurers with an immortal patron, except perhaps uncommon openness to the mysterious and unknown. You haven't been chosen because of your capabilities; they might have been chosen to fulfill the words of a prophecy, because they were born at auspicious times and places, or because they happened to be in a particular place at a certain time. Individual characters in your group might have different relationships with your patron, though; consider some or all of these roles for your characters:": "没有任何共同的线索将冒险者与不朽的守护者联系在一起，也许只有对神秘和未知的不寻常的开放。你被选中并不是因为你的能力；他们被选中可能是为了实现一个预言，因为他们出生在吉祥的时间和地点，或者因为他们碰巧在某个时间出现在某个特定的地方。不过，你的小组中的个别角色可能与你的赞助人有不同的关系；为你的角色考虑一些或所有这些角色。",
	"{@b Agent}. The Agent doesn't receive direct communications from an immortal patron, but puts faith in the dreams and inspiration of others, following such omens with an eager heart. This character is under no illusions of having a special role to play in the immortal's grand plans, but is ready to make sure those with such roles play them. This is often a character with no magical ability or sometimes from a scholarly background, such as a sage or hermit—perhaps someone familiar with lore about the immortal but not directly inspired by it. Agents typically have proficiency in skills such as {@skill Arcana}, {@skill History}, and {@skill Religion}.": "{@b Agent}. 代理人不接受来自不朽的赞助人的直接沟通，但对其他人的梦想和灵感抱有信心，以热切的心关注这些预兆。这个角色不幻想在不朽者的宏伟计划中扮演特殊的角色，但准备确保那些有这种角色的人扮演他们。这通常是一个没有魔法能力的角色，或者有时来自学术背景，如圣人或隐士--也许是一个熟悉关于不朽者的传说但没有直接受到启发的人。代理人通常有熟练的技能，如（1%）、（2%）和（3%）。",
	"{@b Innocent}. Some characters have no intention of becoming adventurers and desire no connection to the machinations of the immortals, but they get caught up in schemes and prophecies anyway. The Innocent might have been identified as a key part of a prophecy, or made what seemed like an innocent bargain with a harmless old hermit, or found an artifact with mysterious powers. The folk hero background is ideal for the Innocent, combining humble origins with a sense of destiny. Any class or proficiencies are suited for this role.": "{@b Innocent}. 有些角色无意成为冒险家，也不希望与不朽者的阴谋有任何联系，但他们还是被卷入了阴谋和预言中。无辜者可能已经被确定为预言的关键部分，或者与一个无害的老隐士做了一个看似无辜的交易，或者发现了一个具有神秘力量的文物。民间英雄的背景是无罪者的理想选择，将卑微的出身与命运感结合起来。任何等级或能力都适合这个角色。",
	"{@b Visionary}. At least one character in the party should have a particular connection to your immortal patron. The Visionary might hear the patron's voice in dreams, see waking visions that convey the immortal's will, or interpret signs in accordance with prophecy. Different backgrounds might suggest different stories for a Visionary: An acolyte might have had a revelatory experience that paved the way for the immortal's communications. A hermit might have been plagued by disturbing dreams from youth. A sage might have made a lifetime study of the Draconic Prophecy. These characters are often clerics, druids, warlocks, or wizards, and typically proficient in skills such as {@skill Arcana} and {@skill Religion}.": "{@b Visionary}. 队伍中至少有一个角色应该与你的不朽守护者有特殊联系。幻象师可能会在梦中听到守护者的声音，在清醒时看到传达不朽者意志的幻象，或者根据预言解释征兆。不同的背景可能会给幻象师带来不同的故事。一个圣徒可能有一个启示性的经历，为神仙的沟通铺平了道路。一个隐士可能从年轻时就被令人不安的梦境所困扰。一个圣人可能一生都在研究龙族的预言。这些角色通常是牧师、德鲁伊、术士或巫师，通常精通（1%）和（2%）等技能。",
	"The tasks you perform for your immortal patron can be mysterious, even trivial seeming, but they always have implications within the immortal's larger plans. Often it's hard to tell what those implications might be—and stumbling upon hints of an immortal's broader agenda might prove frightening. Your tasks could involve fulfilling prophecies in deliberate ways, preventing prophesied events from coming to pass, or even engaging in seemingly random actions that further designs invisible to mortal eyes. Immortal beings might send you on all manner of adventures, such as those shown on the Immortal Missions table.": "你为你的不朽守护者执行的任务可能是神秘的，甚至是看起来微不足道的，但它们总是在不朽者的更大计划中产生影响。通常很难说这些影响是什么--偶然发现不朽者更广泛的议程的暗示可能会被证明是可怕的。你的任务可能涉及以故意的方式实现预言，阻止预言事件的发生，或者甚至参与看似随机的行动，以推进凡人眼中看不见的设计。不朽的生命可能会派你进行各种形式的冒险，比如不朽的任务表上显示的那些。",

	"Protect a kalashtar monk who is being targeted by Dreaming Dark assassins as she studies a path that might eventually prevent the quori from projecting themselves into the Material Plane.": "保护一个被梦境中的黑暗刺客盯上的卡拉斯塔僧侣，因为她正在研究一条可能最终阻止奎里人投射到物质界的道路。",
	"Immortal beings sometimes use mortal intermediaries to contact their agents, but most of them possess magic powerful enough to communicate with you directly, even over impossible distances. Consult the Immortal Communication table to determine what mysterious method your patron uses to direct your party.": "不朽的生命有时会使用凡人的中介来联系他们的代理人，但他们中的大多数拥有强大的魔法，足以直接与你沟通，甚至在不可能的距离上。请参考不朽者交流表，以确定你的赞助人用什么神秘的方法来指导你的队伍。",

	"Various immortal beings exert their will upon the people and nations of Eberron. Many are villainous forces that adventurers might find themselves resisting, such as the fiends of the Lords of Dust or the Quori and the Dreaming Dark. Even those without evil motives are often inscrutable—the agendas of immortal beings spanning millennia. What role you might play in an immortal's schemes and what sorts of deeds you'll be called on to perform varies from patron to patron. Consider the following options when determining what immortal patron your party might serve:": "各种不朽的存在对艾伯伦的人民和国家施加他们的意志。很多都是冒险者可能会发现自己在抵抗的邪恶势力，比如尘埃领主的恶魔或科里和梦境的黑暗。即使是那些没有邪恶动机的人，也往往是难以捉摸的--不朽的生命的议程跨越了几千年的时间。你在不朽者的计划中可能扮演什么样的角色，以及你会被召唤去做什么样的事，因赞助人而异。在决定你的队伍可能为哪个不朽的守护者服务时，请考虑以下选项。",
	"{@b Flamewind}. A gynosphinx with oracular powers came back to Morgrave University with a Xen'drik expedition two years ago, and took up residence there. In addition to her first-hand knowledge of Xen'drik, she is one of the few nondragons to have made extensive study of the Draconic Prophecy. She sometimes sends adventurers on missions by uttering a cryptic prophecy. \"It is time for the Globe of Seven Lights to be brought out of Xen'drik,\" she might say. She never explains her proclamations, and never provides information on mundane affairs.": "{@b Flamewind}. 两年前，一个拥有神力的雌性动物随Xen'drik探险队回到了莫格莱夫大学，并在那里居住下来。除了对Xen'drik的第一手资料外，她还是少数对Draconic预言进行过广泛研究的非龙人之一。她有时会通过说出一个神秘的预言来派遣冒险者执行任务。她可能会说：\"现在是把七彩光球带出Xen'drik的时候了\"。她从不解释她的预言，也不提供有关世俗事务的信息。",
	"{@b Faerie Court}. Somewhere deep in the western forest of the Eldeen Reaches lies the Twilight Demesne, where powerful archfey hold court over an ongoing revelry. It often appears as if nothing more than mischief and caprice governs the actions of the archfey, but they have ancient interests in the mortal world—as well as extensive rivalries among themselves.": "{@b Faerie Court}. 在Eldeen Reaches西部森林深处的某个地方，有一个暮光之城，在那里，强大的大法师们正在举行狂欢。看起来似乎只有恶作剧和任性才能支配大法官的行动，但他们在凡人世界有古老的利益，以及他们之间广泛的竞争。",
	"{@b Undying Court}. The honored, undead ancestors of Aerenal rule the elven nation and shape their people's destiny. These undead—known as deathless—despise evil undead, nurture an ancient grudge against dragons, and pursue the fulfillment of ancient prophecies.": "{@b Undying Court}. 阿伦纳尔尊贵的亡灵祖先统治着精灵国度，塑造着他们的人民的命运。这些被称为 \"无死神 \"的亡灵憎恨邪恶的亡灵，对龙怀有古老的怨恨，并追求古代预言的实现。",
	"Your party works for an agency offering investigative services, or you might run your own firm as a group. Inquisitives put their keen minds and dogged determination to use unraveling mysteries. Inquisitive agencies run the gamut from private investigators to networks of detectives supported by dragonmarked houses.": "你们一行人在一个提供调查服务的机构工作，或者你们可能作为一个团体经营自己的公司。探究者将他们敏锐的头脑和坚定的决心用于揭开谜团。调查机构的范围很广，从私人调查员到由龙纹屋支持的侦探网络。",
	"Across Khorvaire, the inquisitives of House Tharashk have a reputation for discretion and cunning. Members of that house operate the Finders Guild, a loose collection of independent inquisitive agencies. Dragonmarked heirs of House Tharashk own and operate some of these agencies, but each employs unmarked inquisitives as well, leaving the heirs free to take on the most difficult cases. A connection with the Finders Guild is viewed as a mark of high quality, a guarantee that a particular agency numbers among the best in the business.": "在整个Khorvaire，Tharashk家族的调查员以谨慎和狡猾著称。该家族的成员经营着 \"发现者协会\"，这是一个独立调查机构的松散集合。塔拉什克家族的龙纹继承人拥有并经营其中一些机构，但每个机构也都雇佣了无纹章的审问者，让继承人自由地处理最棘手的案件。与探索者协会的联系被视为高质量的标志，是对某一机构在业务上名列前茅的保证。",
	"In the city of Sharn alone, four inquisitives with the Mark of Finding lead agencies in different parts of the city: Kurt Karr'Aashta's Investigations in the neighborhood of Deathsgate, Information Acquisition in Underlook, Thuranne Velderan's Investigative Services in Warden Towers, and Globe Information Agency in Dragon Towers. Your party might be associated with any of these groups, or you might operate your own affiliated agency. In any case, your connection to the Finders Guild means you have a sterling reputation to uphold.": "仅仅在沙恩市，就有四位拥有 \"寻找标记 \"的调查员在城市的不同地区领导机构。Kurt Karr'Aashta的调查公司在死亡之门附近，信息获取公司在Underlook，Thuranne Velderan的调查公司在Warden Towers，以及Globe Information Agency在Dragon Towers。你的政党可能与这些团体中的任何一个有关联，或者你可能经营你自己的附属机构。在任何情况下，你与寻找者协会的联系意味着你有一个良好的声誉需要维护。",
	"In yet another embarrassing blow to the Fairhaven Watch, renowned inquisitive \"Feather\" Fallester has apparently solved yet another case she randomly pulled from the watch's files of unsolved mysteries. The case—the theft of a bejeweled statuette on display in the University of Wynarn Museum of Antiquities—baffled watch officers seven years ago, but in a matter of five days, Fallester managed to pin the crime on a changeling thief called Spaut, who has confessed.": "在费尔黑文表的又一次尴尬打击中，著名的好奇心强的 \"羽毛 \"Fallester显然已经解决了她随意从表的未解之谜档案中抽出的又一个案件。七年前，怀恩大学古物博物馆展出的一尊宝石雕像被盗，这起案件令守望者困惑不已，但在短短五天内，Fallester成功地将罪行归咎于一个叫Spaut的变种人小偷，他已经招供。",
	"While the Finders' Guild's greatest strength is its internal connections, it lacks many strong allies beyond House Tharashk's holdings. That said, the following groups have had numerous interactions with the guild and generally view inquisitives in a positive light:": "虽然探究者协会最大的优势在于其内部联系，但在塔拉什克家族的领地之外，它缺乏许多强有力的盟友。尽管如此，以下团体已经与该公会进行了多次互动，并普遍以积极的态度看待探询者。",
	"{@b Droaam}. Since the rise of the Daughters of Sora Kell in Droaam, members of House Tharashk have served as intermediaries between the realm of monsters and the east, bartering the services of monstrous mercenaries across Khorvaire. The house takes great pride in having forced mainstream Khorvaire to recognize that orcs and half-orcs are worthy of the same courtesies and opportunities as races long established in society, and house members are now using their status to do the same for various other races from Droaam. As a result, members of the Finders' Guild can expect at least a modicum of respect while traveling in Droaam": "{@b Droaam}. 自从索拉-凯尔的女儿们在德拉姆崛起后，塔拉什克家族的成员就成为了怪物王国和东方之间的中间人，在整个霍尔韦尔以怪物雇佣兵的服务进行交换。该家族非常自豪地迫使霍尔韦尔的主流社会认识到，兽人和半兽人值得获得与社会上长期存在的种族一样的礼遇和机会，而且该家族成员现在正利用他们的地位，为来自德拉姆的其他各种种族做同样的事。因此，寻找者协会的成员在德罗安旅行时，至少可以期待得到适度的尊重。",
	"{@b Gatekeepers}. House Tharashk and the druidic sect of the Gatekeepers share common origins in the Shadow Marches, and the druids remain friendly with the house and its Finders' Guild. In the Marches, the guild often helps the druids locate stray aberrations and open portals between planes of existence. For their part, the Gatekeepers offer the support of their magic to aid guild members in whatever ways they can.": "{@b Gatekeepers}. Tharashk家族和守门人的德鲁伊教派在阴影地带有着共同的起源，德鲁伊与该家族及其寻找者公会保持着友好关系。在马尔奇，该公会经常帮助德鲁伊找到游离的畸变体，并打开各存在平面之间的传送门。守门人则提供他们的魔法支持，以任何方式帮助公会成员。",
	"The work of inquisitives naturally creates enemies, mostly on a local scale: con artists, gangs, and others who have had their unsavory deeds uncovered. Such groups are inclined to hold grudges against the guild as a whole. The guild's enemies on a larger scale are few, but include the following groups.": "调查员的工作自然会产生敌人，主要是在当地范围内：骗子、帮派，以及其他被揭发了不光彩行为的人。这些团体倾向于对整个行会怀恨在心。公会在更大范围内的敌人很少，但包括以下群体。",
	"{@b Daask}. The Finders Guild has a difficult relationship with the criminal organization called Daask. On the one hand, Daask is a violent criminal gang whose members are often targeted by Finders Guild inquisitives. On the other hand, Daask is a gang of monsters, many of whom actually left Droaam under the auspices of House Tharashk. Finders Guild inquisitives who pry too deeply into Daask business often feel pressure to back away coming from higher in House Tharashk. Those who ignore that pressure tend to end up the targets of Daask assassins.": "{@b Daask}. 寻找者协会与名为Daask的犯罪组织有着艰难的关系。一方面，达斯克是一个暴力犯罪团伙，其成员经常成为寻找者协会调查员的目标。另一方面，达斯克是一个由怪物组成的团伙，其中许多人实际上是在塔拉什克家族的支持下离开德罗阿姆的。寻找者协会的调查员如果对达斯克的业务探究得太深，往往会感到来自塔拉什克家族高层的压力而退缩。那些无视这种压力的人最终会成为达斯克刺客的目标。",
	"{@b House Deneith}. For centuries, House Deneith cornered the market on mercenary forces in Khorvaire. It was an unpleasant surprise for them when House Tharashk entered the mercenary market in the later days of the war, bringing monsters from Droaam to bolster Five Nations armies. House Deneith still resents House Tharashk for this, and the animosity between the houses only increases when Finders' Guild inquisitives stick their noses into Sentinel Marshal business.": "{@b House Deneith}. 几个世纪以来，Deneith家族垄断了Khorvaire的雇佣军市场。当Tharashk家族在战争后期进入雇佣兵市场，从Droaam带来怪物以加强五国军队时，这对他们来说是一个不愉快的惊喜。迪尼斯家族至今仍对塔拉什克家族心怀怨恨，而当发现者协会的调查员将他们的鼻子伸向哨兵元帅的生意时，两族之间的敌意只会增加。",
	"With an inquisitive agency as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:": "有一个充满好奇心的机构作为你的团体的赞助人，你会获得以下好处。",
	"{@b Compensation}. You can collect fees from your clients when you undertake investigations on their behalf. You can set those fees, and clients will often pay higher fees as your reputation and prestige increase. A fee of 5 sp to 10 sp per inquisitive per day, plus expenses incurred as part of the investigation, is a reasonable starting rate.": "{@b Compensation}. 当你代表客户进行调查时，你可以从客户那里收取费用。你可以设定这些费用，随着你的声誉和声望的提高，客户往往会支付更高的费用。每位调查员每天的费用为5-10英镑，加上调查过程中产生的费用，这是一个合理的起始费率。",
	"{@b Contacts}. Through the Finders' Guild, each associated inquisitive agency can benefit from the knowledge and experience of not only other inquisitives, but also bounty hunters, explorers, dragonshard prospectors, and others who make use of House Tharashk's talent for finding. Thus, an affiliated agency might find helpful allies not only in cities throughout the Five Nations, but even in remote corners of the wilderness where trackers and prospectors ply their trade. At the DM's discretion, your contacts might direct you to new cases, offer you leads in the case you're working on, put you in touch with their own network of contacts, or show up suddenly to pull you out of the fire. You can call in a favor from your agency to draw on the resources of any of your contacts. At the start of the campaign, roll twice on the Contacts table to choose two contacts. You will certainly acquire new contacts in the course of your adventures, who might or might not fit the descriptions of contacts on this table.": "{@b Contacts}. 通过寻找者协会，每个相关的探究机构不仅可以从其他探究者的知识和经验中获益，还可以从赏金猎人、探险家、龙石勘探者以及其他利用塔拉什克家族的寻找天赋的人那里获益。因此，一个附属机构不仅可以在整个五国的城市中找到有用的盟友，甚至还可以在追踪者和勘探者从事贸易的偏远荒野角落中找到。根据DM的判断，你的联系人可能会把你引向新的案件，为你正在处理的案件提供线索，让你与他们自己的关系网取得联系，或者突然出现，把你从火中拉出来。你可以请你的机构帮忙，利用你的任何联系人的资源。在活动开始时，在联系人表上滚动两次，选择两个联系人。在你的冒险过程中，你肯定会获得新的联系人，他们可能符合也可能不符合这张表格中对联系人的描述。",

	"A wide variety of talents can be useful in the work of an inquisitive, leading the Finders' Guild to employ specialists with diverse skill sets. Many inquisitives come from backgrounds such as criminal, sage, soldier, or urchin, regardless of the role they play in a group. Consider some or all of these roles for characters in your party:": "各种各样的才能在探究者的工作中都是有用的，这导致探究者协会雇佣了具有不同技能的专家。许多探究者的背景是罪犯、贤者、士兵或顽童，无论他们在一个团体中扮演什么角色。可以考虑为你的队伍中的角色设置一些或所有这些角色。",
	"{@b Client}. When a routine investigation goes sideways, sometimes innocents get unwillingly caught in the action. The common artisan who hired the party to find her missing partner might find herself and her hired inquisitives on the run when things take a deadly turn. Such a Client is often a nonplayer character whose connection with the party is dissolved at the end of an adventure, but sometimes a Client develops a taste for excitement and becomes a fixture in the campaign. A perfectly ordinary background such as guild artisan or folk hero often work well with this character, who otherwise needs no specific proficiencies or capabilities.": "{@b Client}. 当常规调查出现偏差时，有时无辜者会不情愿地被卷入这场行动。当事情出现致命的转变时，雇佣团队寻找失踪伙伴的普通工匠可能会发现自己和她雇佣的调查员正在逃亡。这样的客户通常是一个非玩家角色，在冒险结束时，他与队伍的联系就会被解除，但有时客户会发展出对刺激的兴趣，并成为活动中的一个固定角色。一个完全普通的背景，如行会工匠或民间英雄，往往能很好地配合这个角色，否则他不需要特殊的技能或能力。",
	"{@b Consultant}. Sometimes skilled individuals end up working alongside inquisitives for a time. Such Consultants might work for a newspaper, study an esoteric field, or write crime fiction for a living. This character is usually similar to an Investigator, but typically has an unusual background or expert knowledge. The relationship between a Consultant and the rest of the party can be a source of drama—or comedy.": "{@b Consultant}. 有时，有技能的人最终会与探究者一起工作一段时间。这样的顾问可能为报纸工作，研究一个深奥的领域，或者以写犯罪小说为生。这种人物通常与调查员相似，但通常有不寻常的背景或专家知识。顾问和其他成员之间的关系可以是戏剧性的来源，也可以是喜剧性的。",
	"{@b Interrogator}. The Interrogator specializes in interaction with suspects, witnesses, or others who need persuasion to reveal what they know.

	"{@b Tough}. An inquisitive's work is inherently dangerous, so it's often important for their group to include someone who can physically intervene when situations devolve into combat.

The {@skill Intimidation} skill can also helpfully supplement the Tough's work.": "{@b Tough}. 探究者的工作本质上是危险的，所以他们的小组中往往要有一个能在情况演变成战斗时进行身体干预的人。强硬派的角色可能包括打击犯罪分子，踢门，甚至粗暴对待嫌疑人，所有这些都表明他们有较高的力量得分和战斗能力。{@skill Intimidation}技能也可以帮助补充强悍者的工作。",
	"Much of the work done by inquisitives is relatively mundane: collecting evidence of marital infidelity, investigating insurance fraud, or finding runaways. Sometimes these relatively innocent investigations can lead into the shadowy underbelly of society and become more dangerous, but most adventurers prefer the more dangerous kinds of inquisitive work. Your group might specialize in one particular kind of work, or it might take whatever cases come its way. Roll or pick from the Investigative Expertise table to determine your agency's specialty.": "调查员所做的大部分工作都是相对平凡的：收集婚姻不忠的证据，调查保险欺诈，或寻找逃亡者。有时，这些相对无害的调查会引向社会的阴暗面，变得更加危险，但大多数冒险家更喜欢更危险的调查工作。你的团队可能会专门从事一种特殊的工作，也可能会接下任何案件。从调查专长表中选择，以确定你的机构的专长。",

	"Inquisitives occupy a significant place in the popular imagination, both in their real-life exploits (as reported in the newspapers) and in many fictionalized accounts.

	"{@b Warning Guild}. Affiliated with but largely independent from House Medani, the Warning Guild provides certification and contract employment for bodyguards, inquisitives, and sentries across Khorvaire.

Its inquisitives are often called upon to solve mysteries that baffle local law enforcement.": "{@b Warning Guild}. 警告公会隶属于梅达尼家族，但在很大程度上独立于梅达尼家族，为整个霍尔韦尔的保镖、调查员和哨兵提供认证和合同雇佣。该公会强调使用逻辑、感知和推理，将证据的碎片组合成一个可识别的整体。它的调查员经常被要求解决那些令当地执法部门困惑的谜团。",
	"{@b Running Your Own}. Rather than join an existing inquisitive agency, you can start your own. You need to establish your own office.

You can also use the Running a Business downtime activity to direct the activities of your agency, as described at the start of this section.": "{@b Running Your Own}. 与其加入一个现有的探究机构，不如自己创业。你需要建立自己的办公室。你可以收取与为其他机构工作相同的费用，而且你可以获得相同范围的联系。你也可以使用 \"经营企业 \"的停工活动来指导你的机构的活动，如本节开头所述。",
	"Your group serves as a team of soldiers in a larger military force, one dedicated to combat missions or other dangerous tasks. You could be a team of mercenaries, a special forces unit, or an ordinary squad of infantry. Perhaps you protect a nation's people from monsters, or even continue to fight the Last War in the shadows.

	"The soldiers of the Redcloak Battalion number among the deadliest warriors in Breland. When a situation calls for extreme military force, law enforcers turn to the Redcloak Battalion.

At the end of the war, the battalion was split up and its units assigned to cities and strongholds across Breland.": "红斗篷营的士兵是布雷兰德最致命的战士之一。当情况需要极端的军事力量时，执法者会求助于红环营。这支精英部队在最后的战争中战斗在最前线，布瑞利什的吟游诗人仍在歌颂锤子坎丹和女猎手梅拉的功绩。战争结束后，该营被拆分，其部队被分配到布瑞尔各地的城市和据点。",

	"First, the Redcloaks do sometimes take inexperienced adventurers under their wings. Existing Redcloaks proved themselves on the battlefields of the Last War; if the group is to continue, the Redcloaks of the future have to learn the soldier's trade in different battles. To such ends, senior members of the battalion send your party on missions across Khorvaire to provide you with combat experience as well as to further Redcloak goals.": "首先，红环会有时确实会把没有经验的冒险者纳入他们的麾下。现有的红环会成员在最后一次战争的战场上证明了自己；如果该组织要继续下去，未来的红环会成员必须在不同的战斗中学习士兵的技能。为了达到这样的目的，营里的高级成员会派你的队伍在整个霍尔韦尔执行任务，为你提供战斗经验，并进一步实现红环会的目标。",
	"Alternatively, your DM might decide to start the campaign with your characters at a higher level and already established as members of the Redcloaks (see \"{@book Starting at Higher Level|DMG|1|Starting at Higher Level}\" in chapter 1 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}). In this case, you might also begin with magic items and other gear reflecting your status in the organization. The standard-issue uniform for the Redcloaks is a hooded crimson {@item cloak of protection} bearing two badges: the seal of the Brelish crown on the left shoulder and a snarling displacer beast surrounded by the words, \"First in battle, last to fall\"—the Redcloak insignia and motto—on the right.": "或者，你的DM可能会决定在活动开始时，让你的角色处于更高的级别，并且已经成为红环组织的成员（见《{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}》第一章的\"{@book Starting at Higher Level|DMG|1|Starting at Higher Level}\"）。在这种情况下，你也可以开始拥有反映你在组织中地位的魔法物品和其他装备。红十字会的标准制服是一件深红色的连帽制服（%%2%），上面有两个徽章：左肩上有布雷利什王冠的印记，右肩上有一只咆哮的流离兽，周围写着 \"战斗第一，最后倒下\"--红十字会的徽章和箴言。",
	"As part of Breland's military forces, the Redcloaks can count on the support of the crown, the King's Citadel, and the larger Brelish army, largely summarized as the following parties:": "作为布雷兰军事力量的一部分，红衣军团可以依靠王室、国王城堡和更大的布雷兰军队的支持，主要概括为以下几方面。",
	"{@b King Boranel}. The king of Breland is a cautious advocate of the Redcloaks. He values their contributions but fears their power, which is why he divided the battalion after the end of the war. Still, he rewards loyalty among the Redcloaks by showing loyalty to them in return. Again and again, he has proven himself willing to exercise his power on behalf of a loyal Redcloak.": "{@b King Boranel}. 布雷兰德的国王是红袍人的谨慎拥护者。他重视他们的贡献，但害怕他们的力量，这就是为什么他在战争结束后分化了营队。不过，他还是通过对红环会的忠诚作为回报来奖励他们的忠诚。他一次又一次地证明自己愿意为忠诚的红袍人行使他的权力。",
	"{@b Other Redcloaks}. The first place any Redcloak turns for help is another Redcloak. No one else is as reliable and competent, while being unerringly faithful to the Brelish king and the battalion. Every Redcloak readily provides aid to other members, with no questions asked and no favor expected in return.": "{@b Other Redcloaks}. 任何红袍人首先求助的地方是另一个红袍人。没有人像其他人那样可靠和有能力，同时对布雷利什国王和营队毫不动摇地忠诚。每个红斗篷人都乐意为其他成员提供帮助，不问任何问题，也不期待回报。",
	"As veterans of the Last War, many Redcloaks carry strong grudges against other nations. They tend to believe that the Treaty of Thronehold is merely an intermission in the ongoing conflict, and soon enough King Boranel will take his proper place on the throne of a reunited Galifar. Many of these grudges are personal based on an individual soldier's experience in the war, but some of them run both ways. Among the Redcloaks, tensions still run hot regarding their former rivals, particularly those from the following nations:": "作为最后战争的老兵，许多红袍人对其他国家怀有强烈的怨恨。他们倾向于认为《王座条约》只是正在进行的冲突中的一个中场休息，很快博拉内尔国王就会在重新统一的加利法尔的王座上获得他应有的地位。这些怨恨中有许多是基于个别士兵在战争中的经历而产生的个人恩怨，但有些是双向的。在红袍人中，对于他们以前的对手，特别是来自以下国家的对手，紧张关系仍然很激烈。",
	"{@b Darguun}. The hobgoblins of Darguun fought alongside Brelish forces at the Battle of Cairn Hill, but the cordial relations between the two nations frayed immediately after. The Redcloaks skirmished with hobgoblins who were leading Thrane civilians in chains back to Darguun. Few Darguuls remember the skirmish itself, but the \"wicked red-cloaked Brelish\" have an established place in the goblinoids' collective memory—and many Redcloaks do remember the event bitterly.": "{@b Darguun}. 达尔古恩的妖精在凯恩山战役中与布瑞利什的部队并肩作战，但两国之间的友好关系紧接着就破裂了。红袍人与霍比特人发生了短兵相接，霍比特人正带着被锁链锁住的瑟兰平民返回达尔古恩。很少有达尔古尔人记得这场战斗本身，但 \"邪恶的红袍布雷利什 \"在地精们的集体记忆中占有一席之地--许多红袍人确实痛苦地记得这个事件。",
	"{@b Thrane}. In the waning years of the Last War, the Redcloaks played a major role in the devastating Battle of Cairn Hill between Brelish and Thrane forces. Thanks to heavy losses on both sides, veterans of that battle tend to nurse bitter grudges against their enemies.": "{@b Thrane}. 在最后一次战争即将结束的时候，红袍人在布雷利什和瑟兰军队之间毁灭性的凯恩山之战中发挥了重要作用。由于双方都损失惨重，那场战役的老兵们往往对他们的敌人怀有痛苦的怨恨。",
	"With a military force as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:": "如果有一支军队作为你的团体的赞助人，你会获得以下好处。",
	"{@b Accommodations}. You can always find a place to stay and meals on a base or fort connected to your military force. Your accommodations are appropriate to your rank and station, but never luxurious.": "{@b Accommodations}. 你总能在与你的军队有关的基地或要塞找到住宿和吃饭的地方。你的住宿条件与你的军衔和职位相称，但绝不是豪华的。",
	"Venturing unusually far from their accustomed territory in the eastern jungles, a band of enormous lizardfolk—described by local experts as members of the Blackscale Tribe—broke through the fortifications at Adderport and killed thirteen residents before retreating back into the jungles. Khalar d'Tharashk has announced a plan to track the perpetrators and exact retribution under the sponsorship of King Sebastes.": "一群巨大的蜥蜴人--被当地专家描述为黑鳞部落的成员--不寻常地远离了他们在东部丛林中的习惯领地，冲破了阿德波特的防御工事，杀死了13名居民，然后退回到丛林中。卡勒-达拉什克（Khalar d'Tharashk）宣布了一项计划，在塞巴斯蒂安国王的支持下，追踪肇事者并实施报复。",
	"{@b Armory}. You can purchase nonmagical weapons and armor at a 20 percent discount at a facility associated with your military force. This might also be a location where you can buy magic items, at the DM's discretion, but you receive no discount.": "{@b Armory}. 你可以在一个与你的军队有关的设施中以20%的折扣购买非魔法武器和盔甲。这也可能是一个你可以购买魔法物品的地点，由DM决定，但你没有得到任何折扣。",
	"{@b Chain of Command}. You are part of a rigid chain of command. In addition to providing you with orders, this structure reduces your responsibility for your own actions. If you land in trouble in your own nation, you answer to your officers, not local law enforcement.": "{@b Chain of Command}. 你是一个僵化的指挥系统的一部分。除了为你提供命令外，这种结构还减少了你对自己行为的责任。如果你在自己的国家遇到麻烦，你要对你的官员负责，而不是对当地执法部门负责。",
	"{@b Orders}. You undertake your missions at the direction of a commanding officer. Your absolute obedience is expected. These missions are often explicit, leading you into the path of adventure. In some cases, though, you might be trusted with more open-ended tasks that afford you more leeway in interpreting orders.": "{@b Orders}. 你们在指挥员的指导下执行任务。预计你会绝对服从。这些任务通常是明确的，引导你进入冒险的道路。但在某些情况下，你可能会被信任，承担更多的开放式任务，使你在解释命令时有更多的余地。",
	"{@b Salary}. Each member of your group is paid a regular salary. The amount varies depending on your organization and your position within it, but at minimum you enjoy a modest lifestyle. You might receive a small salary (as little as 1 sp per day) but also receive food and housing on a military base. Or you could receive 1 gp per day but rely on that money for room and board. With higher rank comes commensurately higher pay. As an officer, you can maintain a comfortable lifestyle.": "{@b Salary}. 你们小组的每个成员都有固定工资。数额因你的组织和你在其中的地位而异，但至少你享有适度的生活方式。你可能会收到一份小的工资（少到每天1英镑），但也会在一个军事基地获得食物和住房。或者你可以每天收到1戈比，但依靠这些钱来获得食宿。随着军衔的提高，工资也相应提高。作为一名军官，你可以保持一种舒适的生活方式。",
	"A military unit, like most adventuring parties, incorporates a range of useful skills while covering each member's weaknesses with another's strengths. Thus, characters of any class can find a home in such a unit, and a diversity of different skills and backgrounds benefits the group as a whole. Consider some or all of these roles for characters in your party:": "一个军事单位，就像大多数冒险队伍一样，融合了一系列有用的技能，同时用另一个人的长处来弥补每个成员的弱点。因此，任何等级的角色都可以在这样的团队中找到归宿，不同技能和背景的多样性对整个团队都是有益的。考虑在你的队伍中扮演这些角色的一部分或全部。",
	"{@b Commander}. Every band of infantry has its leader, even if that person isn't a officer. The Commander earns that position through some combination of high Charisma and Intelligence—the ability to inspire and the capacity to plan. Proficiency in skills such as {@skill Persuasion} and {@skill History} can be helpful as well. The Commander might be a career soldier (with that background) or someone from a noble background placed in command by virtue of birth. A Commander might be a fighter, bard, cleric, paladin, or even wizard—as magic proves valuable in military engagements.": "{@b Commander}. 每支步兵队伍都有其领导者，即使这个人不是军官。指挥官通过高魅力和高智力的某种组合来赢得这个位置--激励的能力和计划的能力。熟练掌握{@skill Persuasion}和{@skill History}等技能也会有帮助。指挥官可能是一个职业军人（有这种背景），或者是一个出身高贵的人，因为出生而被置于指挥地位。指挥官可能是一个战士、吟游诗人、牧师、圣骑士，甚至是巫师--因为魔法在军事行动中证明是有价值的。",
	"{@b Medic}. Keeping soldiers alive is essential to military success, and that's the Medic's job. In an elite unit of adventurers, the Medic is often a cleric or has another class with healing ability, but these characters are also often proficient in the {@skill Medicine} skill or use of a {@item herbalism kit|PHB}. A Medic can be a soldier who demonstrated aptitude in healing and got moved into this position, or a character from a different background (such as acolyte, sage, or even hermit) who decided to put medical expertise to military use.": "{@b Medic}. 保持士兵的生命是军事成功的关键，这就是医疗兵的工作。在冒险者的精英部队中，医护人员通常是牧师或拥有其他具有治疗能力的等级，但这些角色也通常精通（%%1%）技能或使用（%%2%）。医务兵可以是一个在治疗方面表现出天赋并被调到这个位置的士兵，也可以是一个来自不同背景的人物（如圣徒、贤者，甚至是隐士），他决定将医疗专长用于军事。",
	"{@b Scout}. Trained in navigating the wilderness and laying ambushes for enemy soldiers, the Scout melds the combat skill of a fighter with the skills of a ranger or rogue. High Dexterity and Wisdom scores, combined with proficiency in the {@skill Nature}, {@skill Perception}, {@skill Stealth}, and {@skill Survival} skills, support this character's core capabilities. Scouts are often recruited from people who are more familiar with the wilds than with city streets, including folk heroes, hermits, and outlanders.": "{@b Scout}. 侦察员接受过在野外航行和为敌方士兵设下埋伏的训练，他将战士的战斗技能与游侠或流氓的技能融为一体。高的灵巧和智慧分数，加上对{@skill Nature}、{@skill Perception}、{@skill Stealth}和{@skill Survival}技能的精通，支持了这个人物的核心能力。侦察员通常是从那些对荒野比城市街道更熟悉的人中招募的，包括民间英雄、隐士和外乡人。",
	"{@b Soldier}. Soldiers make up the core of most military groups, whether they're general infantry, magical artillery, or elite special forces. These characters come from all classes and backgrounds—for some, their background before joining the military is more important than their current role. No particular set of talents is common to all soldiers, but military units often strive to avoid duplication of skills.": "{@b Soldier}. 士兵构成了大多数军事团体的核心，无论他们是普通步兵、魔法炮兵，还是精英特种部队。这些角色来自各个阶层和背景--有些人在加入军队之前的背景比他们现在的角色更重要。没有哪一套特定的才能是所有士兵共有的，但军事单位往往努力避免技能的重复。",
	"{@b Warforged}. Literally made for war, most warforged characters have spent the years since the end of the Last War trying to find a new way of life. For some warforged, the answer is to continue fighting the war one way or another, often as part of an organized military unit. This experience, as a people created to fulfill a role and now seemingly locked into a destructive destiny, is just a part of life for many warforged.": "{@b Warforged}. 从字面上看，大多数战神角色都是为战争而生，在最后一次战争结束后的几年里，他们一直在努力寻找一种新的生活方式。对于一些战神来说，答案是继续以这种或那种方式参加战争，通常是作为一个有组织的军事单位的一部分。这种经历，作为一个为履行角色而创造的民族，现在似乎被锁定在一个破坏性的命运中，对许多战神来说只是生活的一部分。",
	"The work involved in serving as a military unit is wide-ranging. Your missions potentially run the risk of shattering the fragile peace established by the Treaty of Thronehold and plunging all of Khorvaire back into war. Alternatively, you might consider running your campaign during the Last War, so your group's missions influence the war effort and don't risk violating the treaty. As a group, consider the options on the Military Missions table and work with your DM to decide how the work you do fits into the larger picture of war and peace in Khorvaire.": "作为一个军事单位，所涉及的工作范围很广。你的任务有可能打破《王权条约》建立的脆弱的和平，使整个霍尔韦尔重新陷入战争。另外，你可以考虑在最后一次战争期间开展你的活动，这样你的小组的任务就会影响到战争的努力，并且不会有违反条约的风险。作为一个团体，考虑军事任务表上的选项，并与你的DM合作，决定你所做的工作如何融入霍尔韦尔的战争与和平的大环境中。",

	"{@b Networker}. The Networker knows exactly who can get the party what they need. This character makes extensive use of contacts and friends to facilitate the party's work.

Interpersonal connections are typically more important than any particular skills or abilities for this character, although many Networkers have high Charisma scores.": "{@b Networker}. 网络者清楚地知道谁能为党派提供他们所需要的东西。这个人物广泛利用联系人和朋友来促进党的工作。一个有犯罪背景的人物可能有黑社会的关系，而一个顽童可能熟悉城市的内部和外部。对这种人物来说，人际关系通常比任何特定的技能或能力更重要，尽管许多网络人有很高的魅力分数。",
	"{@b Snoop}. A Snoop pries into secrets and pieces together the clues behind a sensational story.

	"Your group acts in the service of one of Khorvaire's most prominent or obscure religious institutions. Perhaps you're a team of devotees pursuing a cause for your faith, or maybe you're a bunch of cynics taking advantage of a wealthy congregation. You could be on a mission to retrieve sacred relics lost in ancient ruins, holy objects from war-ravaged temples, or treasures to fill the church's coffers. Your faith might drive you to hunt evil monsters or stave off interplanar invasions, to protect and defend the powerless from oppression and exploitation, or to spread the teachings of your religion in a land that's hostile to it. Or you could serve a corrupt hierarchy by making its enemies quietly disappear—though even the most cynical mercenaries might become true believers when confronted with the miraculous.": "你们的团体为霍尔韦尔最著名或最隐蔽的宗教机构之一服务。也许你们是一队为信仰而追求事业的信徒，也许你们是一群利用富有的教徒的愤青。你们的任务可能是找回遗失在古代废墟中的圣物，从被战争蹂躏的寺庙中找回圣物，或者找回宝物来填充教会的库房。你的信仰可能驱使你去猎杀邪恶的怪物或抵御星际入侵，保护和捍卫无权无势的人免受压迫和剥削，或者在一个对你的宗教有敌意的地方传播你的教义。或者你可以通过让敌人悄悄消失来为腐败的等级制度服务--尽管即使是最愤世嫉俗的雇佣兵在面对奇迹的时候也可能成为真正的信徒。",

	"As templars of the Silver Flame, you have distinctive silver tabards to wear over your other clothing or armor. You also have the privilege of using a knightly honorific before your name (typically \"sir\" or \"lady\"), and you are immediately recognized as a knight, an agent of the church, and effectively a lesser member of Thrane's aristocracy. This status guarantees the good will of members of the church and citizens of Thrane, but carries less weight and might even provoke animosity outside Thrane.": "作为银色火焰的圣殿骑士，你们有独特的银色头巾，可以穿在其他衣服或盔甲外面。你们还享有在名字前使用骑士尊称的特权（通常是 \"先生 \"或 \"女士\"），而且你们会被立即认定为骑士，是教会的代理人，并且实际上是瑟兰贵族中较低级的成员。这一身份保证了教会成员和瑟兰公民的善意，但其分量较轻，甚至可能引起瑟兰以外的敌意。",
	"The order of the Templars of the Silver Flame is represented on the Council of Cardinals that serves as the governing body of Thrane and the church.

	"Knights templar are free to wander the world in pursuit of the order's aims. When leaving the jurisdiction of one commander and entering that of another, it is a knight's responsibility to promptly report to the commander of the new area, in case that commander has a pressing need for a knight to perform a mission. The commanders try to keep each other informed about where knights are operating and what they are doing, but this system works better in some places—and between some commanders—than others.": "圣殿骑士可以自由地在世界范围内游荡，追求骑士团的目标。当离开一位指挥官的管辖范围而进入另一位指挥官的管辖范围时，骑士有责任及时向新地区的指挥官报告，以防该指挥官迫切需要骑士执行任务。指挥官们试图让对方了解骑士在哪里行动以及他们在做什么，但这个系统在一些地方和一些指挥官之间比其他地方更有效。",

	"High Cardinal Baerdren ir'Davik, who also holds the rank of grand master of the templars, appears to be an exemplary templar, utterly dedicated to the mission of the order. Yet it is widely known that he chafes at the political and bureaucratic responsibilities that his position on the Council of Cardinals demands of him. This reporter has learned that Sir Baerdren would readily surrender his position, were it not for his distrust of his seneschal, Ofejjaia of Korth.": "红衣大主教Baerdren ir'Davik，同时也是圣殿骑士团的大团长，似乎是一个模范的圣殿骑士，完全致力于教团的使命。然而，众所周知，他对红衣主教会议要求他承担的政治和官僚责任感到不安。记者了解到，如果不是因为不信任他的参谋长--科思的奥菲加亚，贝尔德伦爵士会很乐意交出他的职位。",
	"Lady Ofejjaia, it seems, has other issues on her personal agenda besides advancing the cause of the knights templar, and one wonders if those issues are tied to her Karrnathi origin. Though her wisdom and sound judgment are not in dispute, it seems that Sir Baerdren fears that she would drive the order into obsolescence or even banishment if she were in charge.": "除了推进圣殿骑士团的事业之外，奥菲佳亚女士似乎还有其他的个人议程，人们不禁要问，这些问题是否与她的卡尔纳提出身有关。虽然她的智慧和正确的判断力没有争议，但似乎贝尔德伦爵士担心，如果她负责的话，她会使骑士团过时甚至被放逐。",
	"Does Lady Ofejjaia hold her lofty position because of her loyalty, her piety, and her qualifications? Or is she there simply so that Sir Baerdren can keep his eye on her and ensure that she doesn't sabotage the templars from within?": "奥菲亚女士之所以能保持她的崇高地位，是因为她的忠诚、她的虔诚和她的资质吗？还是说她在那里只是为了让贝尔德伦爵士能盯着她，确保她不会从内部破坏圣殿骑士团？",
	"{@b Fixer}. The Fixer might work for a religious order for entirely non-religious reasons. This character does the order's dirty work and clears away its problems. It's entirely possible for an entire party to be made up of Fixers, but rogues and fighters are especially well suited to this kind of work. Characters with the criminal background excel at putting their skills and contacts to use on the church's behalf.": "{@b Fixer}. 修复者可能出于完全非宗教的原因为宗教组织工作。这个角色做教团的脏活累活，清除它的问题。整个党派完全有可能由修复者组成，但流氓和战士特别适合这种工作。具有犯罪背景的人物擅长于将他们的技能和关系用于教会的工作。",
	"{@b Prophet}. The Prophet is a visionary with a more-or-less direct connection to the divine. This character might be the driving force behind the group's quests, steering them according to divine will. Proficiency in skills such as {@skill Insight} and {@skill Religion} can help reflect this character's divine connection. The Prophet is often a cleric or druid, but could also be an NPC with no real adventuring skills, who needs the group's protection.": "{@b Prophet}. 先知是一个有远见的人，或多或少与神灵有直接联系。这个人物可能是团体任务背后的驱动力，根据神的意志引导他们。熟练掌握{@skill Insight}和{@skill Religion}等技能可以帮助反映这个人物的神性联系。先知通常是一个牧师或德鲁伊，但也可能是一个没有真正冒险技能的NPC，他需要团体的保护。",
	"{@b Scholar}. The Scholar brings academic knowledge to bear in the religious order's work, often in the form of proficiency in {@skill History} and {@skill Religion}. This character might be an expert on ancient ruins or know all the weaknesses of the demons they are hunting. Characters with access to divination magic (including clerics with the Knowledge domains as well as wizards) might excel at this role. Many Scholars come from the sage background. Unlike the Prophet and Zealot, the Scholar isn't necessarily devout, just knowledgeable.": "{@b Scholar}. 学者将学术知识带入宗教团体的工作中，通常以精通（1%）和（2%）的形式。这个角色可能是古代遗迹的专家，或者知道他们所猎杀的恶魔的所有弱点。能够使用占卜魔法的角色（包括拥有知识领域的牧师以及巫师）可能会擅长这个角色。许多学者都来自圣人的背景。与先知和狂热者不同，学者不一定是虔诚的，只是有知识。",
	"{@b Teacher}. Those in this role spread the teachings of the faith. This isn't usually an effort to win converts—though it can be, especially in the case of the Church of the Silver Flame—but rather the task of encouraging people to live according to the highest ideals of faith. Proficiency in skills such as {@skill Persuasion} (or sometimes {@skill Intimidation}) and {@skill Religion} can be useful for this character. Many clerics fill this role, but devout bards can also be effective Teachers. Some Teachers bring skills from the entertainer background into the service of their faith.": "{@b Teacher}. 这个角色的人传播信仰的教义。这通常不是为了赢得皈依者--尽管它可以，特别是在银焰教会的情况下--而是鼓励人们按照信仰的最高理想生活的任务。熟练掌握{@skill Persuasion}（有时是{@skill Intimidation}）和{@skill Religion}等技能对这个角色很有用。许多牧师扮演这个角色，但虔诚的吟游诗人也可以成为有效的教师。有些教师将艺人背景的技能带入他们的信仰服务中。",
	"{@b Zealot}. Dedicated to smiting the foes of the faith, the Zealot focuses on combat above all. Clerics, druids, and paladins make iconic Zealots, but any character can play this role; there are barbarians whose fury is fueled by their devotion, and rangers sworn to track down the enemies of the faith. The soldier and folk hero backgrounds are well suited to such champions of the faith.": "{@b Zealot}. 狂热者致力于打击信仰的敌人，他的重点是战斗。牧师、德鲁伊和圣骑士是典型的狂热者，但任何角色都可以扮演这个角色；有野蛮人，他们的怒火被他们的奉献所激发，还有游侠发誓要追踪信仰的敌人。士兵和民间英雄的背景很适合于这种信仰的拥护者。",

	"Some religious orders are viewed with suspicion by the priestly hierarchies of their faiths; others are viewed as champions who act as the gods' hands in the world. Within a religious order, some members are highly respected while others are seen as dangerous for one reason or another. What is your relationship to the hierarchy you're a part of? Is your entire order held in particularly high or low esteem? Or does your adventuring party stand out from the larger order for some reason? Is your behavior in line with the expectations of your religion, or is it unorthodox in some way? Reference the Order Reputation table to determine how you're viewed by your larger religious institution.": "一些宗教团体被其信仰的牧师等级制度所怀疑；另一些则被视为冠军，在世界范围内充当神的手。在一个宗教团体中，一些成员受到高度尊重，而另一些则因为这样或那样的原因被视为危险人物。你与你所在的等级制度的关系是什么？你的整个教团受到特别高或特别低的尊重吗？或者你的冒险队伍由于某种原因而从大的秩序中脱颖而出？你的行为是符合你的宗教的期望，还是在某种程度上是非正统的？参考教团声誉表，以确定你被你的大宗教机构如何看待。",

	"Your primary contact within the religious order is usually some kind of priest—not necessarily a cleric or druid, but someone who holds a priestly office and a position of some authority in the hierarchy of the organization. This person might direct you and your adventures according to their interpretation of divine will, or they might trust the gods to lead you to do what needs to be done. Of course, some priests (as well as lay functionaries) are more interested in their own agendas than any supposed divine will. Consult the Order Contact table to determine your liaison within the religious order.": "你在宗教团体中的主要联系人通常是某种牧师--不一定是牧师或德鲁伊，而是在该组织的等级制度中担任牧师职务和某种权威地位的人。这个人可能会根据他们对神意的解释来指导你和你的冒险，或者他们可能相信神明会带领你去做需要做的事情。当然，有些牧师（以及非专业的职能人员）对他们自己的议程更感兴趣，而不是任何所谓的神的意志。请参考教团联系表，确定你在教团内的联络人。",
	"A cloistered priest with little worldly experience who doesn't really understand what you do but seems to approve of it anyway": "一个没有什么世俗经验的隐居牧师，他并不真正理解你的工作，但似乎还是赞同你的工作。",
	"A cynical priest who thinks nothing you do makes any difference in the grand scheme of things": "一个愤世嫉俗的牧师，认为你所做的一切在大计划中都没有任何区别",

	"An institution of higher education sponsors your group. You might be researchers, bodyguards for scholars, or glorified treasure hunters searching for ancient artifacts.

	"At the heart of Sharn's Morgrave University is a sharp dichotomy: On the one hand, it is known as a nexus for scholars wishing to study Xen'drik, thanks in large part to Sharn's proximity to the secret continent. Its collections of artifacts and scholarly works about ancient Xen'drik and the Dhakaan Empire are unparalleled. In many ways, it lives up to the shining vision of its founder, Lord Lareth ir'Morgrave, to be \"a beacon of knowledge shining from the tallest towers of the city.\"": "沙恩的莫格莱夫大学的核心是一个尖锐的二元对立。一方面，它被称为希望研究Xen'drik的学者们的纽带，这在很大程度上要归功于沙恩靠近这个秘密大陆。它所收藏的关于古代Xen'drik和达卡帝国的文物和学术著作是无与伦比的。在许多方面，它没有辜负其创始人拉雷斯-伊尔-莫格莱夫勋爵的光辉愿景，即成为 \"一座从城市最高的塔楼上照亮的知识明灯\"。",
	"On the other hand, the university's reputation is tainted by allegations of smuggling, treasure hunting, and profiteering. Many priceless relics recovered from Xen'drik or Dhakaani ruins have disappeared from the university vaults and found their way to the black market or into the hands of the Aurum. It's an open secret that some scholars, professors, and even students at the university have ties to smugglers and thieves. All these allegations, too, have ties to the university's founding: Lord Morgrave himself is said to have made his fortune selling Dhakaani artifacts on the black market, and some have claimed that the true purpose of the university was to help him build his fortune through such questionable means.": "另一方面，该大学的声誉也因走私、寻宝和牟取暴利的指控而受到损害。许多从Xen'drik或Dhakaani遗迹中找到的无价文物都从大学的金库中消失了，并被发现进入黑市或落入Aurum的手中。大学的一些学者、教授、甚至学生与走私者和盗贼有联系，这是一个公开的秘密。所有这些指控，也都与该大学的创立有关系。据说莫格莱夫勋爵本人就是通过在黑市上出售达卡尼文物而发家的，有些人声称大学的真正目的是帮助他通过这种可疑的手段建立财富。",
	"The academic world is relatively small, and people at any one university tend to have connections at others. You might parlay such relationships into assistance from academies and institutions, such as the following organizations:": "学术界相对较小，任何一所大学的人往往在其他大学有关系。你可以将这种关系转化为来自学院和机构的援助，如以下组织。",
	"{@b Flamewind}. The sphinx Flamewind (described in the \"Immortal Being\" section) isn't officially affiliated with the university, but she lives there and spends much of her time in its libraries and museums. As a scholar of the Draconic Prophecy, Flamewind often poses strange questions and sends adventurers on obscure missions.": "{@b Flamewind}. 狮身人面兽Flamewind（在 \"不朽的存在 \"一节中描述过）并不正式隶属于这所大学，但她住在那里，大部分时间都在图书馆和博物馆中度过。作为一个研究龙族预言的学者，焰风经常提出一些奇怪的问题，并派冒险者执行一些晦涩难懂的任务。",
	"{@b Library of Korranberg}. The Library of Korranberg boasts the greatest collection of learning in Khorvaire.

	"{@b The Twelve}. For many scholars of magical studies, the idea of pursuing their research under the auspices of the Twelve is a cherished dream. Some faculty members at Morgrave have had the opportunity to do just that, and many others have nurtured connections to the Twelve in an attempt to secure that honor.

Should your group needs a grant or resources from the Wayfinders, a letter of recommendation from someone at Morgrave carries some weight.": "{@b Wayfinder Foundation}. 莫格莱夫与探路者基金会保持着广泛的联系--这是一个专门为冒险家服务的行会，它为远方的探险活动提供资金。如果你的团队需要探路者基金会的资助或资源，莫格莱夫的推荐信会有一定分量。",
	"Morgrave University has few true enemies but many rivals. Despite the friendly ties among academic institutions, Morgrave occupies the low end of the prestige scale among academic bodies, so its faculty tends to look for opportunities to steal glory from its academic peers. Beyond rivalries with allied organizations, Morgrave openly competes with the following group:": "莫格莱夫大学真正的敌人很少，但对手却很多。尽管学术机构之间有着友好的联系，但莫格莱夫在学术机构中占据着低端的声望，因此其教师往往会寻找机会从学术同行那里窃取荣耀。除了与联盟组织的竞争外，莫格莱夫还与以下团体公开竞争。",
	"{@b University of Wynarn}. Foremost among Morgrave's rivals is Aundair's University of Wynarn, whose administrators have been known to refer to Morgrave as an \"institute of learning, relic hunting, and grave robbing.\" The University of Wynarn is ancient—the first university established in the Five Nations—and more prestigious than Morgrave. It sponsors many of the same kind of expeditions and can boast many great discoveries, yet, somehow, Morgrave is more famous, and that stings many among the university's staff.": "{@b University of Wynarn}. 在莫格莱夫的竞争对手中，最重要的是昂代尔的威纳恩大学，其管理者曾将莫格莱夫称为 \"学习、遗迹狩猎和盗墓的学院\"。威纳恩大学是一所古老的大学，是五国中成立的第一所大学，比摩格莱夫更有声望。它赞助了许多同类型的探险活动，并可以夸耀许多伟大的发现，然而，不知何故，莫格莱夫更有名，这让大学的许多员工感到震惊。",
	"With a university as your group's patron, you gain the following benefits:": "如果有一所大学作为你的团体的赞助人，你将获得以下好处。",
	"{@b Compensation}. The university pays for the work you do on its behalf. The nature of your employment influences how you are paid. On average, the university pays each member of your group 1 gp per day, or enough to sustain a modest lifestyle. Or you might be paid a bounty for each ancient artifact you bring back from your adventures and give to the university.": "{@b Compensation}. 大学为你代表它所做的工作付费。你的工作性质影响着你的报酬方式。平均来说，大学每天付给你们每个人1戈比，或者足够维持一个小规模的生活。或者，你从冒险中带回的每件古代文物都会得到一笔赏金，并交给大学。",
	"{@b Documentation}. Each member of your group has identification papers that include your affiliation with the university, which carries some clout in academic circles. The university also secures documentation, letters of introduction, and traveling papers for you if your work requires them. Finally, if your adventures take you to Xen'drik, the university secures the necessary letters of marque issued by the king of Breland, which grant you permission to explore the ruins there.": "{@b Documentation}. 你们小组的每个成员都有身份证明文件，其中包括你们与大学的关系，这在学术界具有一定的影响力。如果你的工作需要，大学还可以为你提供文件、介绍信和旅行证件。最后，如果你的冒险活动带你到Xen'drik，大学会确保由Breland国王签发的必要授权书，这些授权书允许你探索那里的遗迹。",
	"{@b Research}. Research might be part of your group's job, but your patron has abundant resources to facilitate it. You can call in a favor to delegate the work of researching lore (a downtime activity described in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} or {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}) to a colleague, contact, or research assistant. You're responsible for covering all expenses occurred as part of this research, and the DM determines the success, failure, or other possible results.": "{@b Research}. 研究可能是你小组工作的一部分，但你的赞助人有丰富的资源来促进它。你可以叫人帮忙，把研究传说的工作（在（%%1%）或（%%2%）中描述的停工活动）委托给同事、联系人或研究助理。你要负责支付作为这项研究的一部分而发生的所有费用，DM决定成功、失败或其他可能的结果。",
	"{@b Resources}. Most universities have extensive libraries and museums, which you have access to. You can call in a favor to gain access to resources that are generally not on exhibit—dangerous relics or possibly magic items, spellbooks, and the like. Additionally, the faculty of your university might make it possible for you to consult with experts in various fields—so long as you can coax them away from their work.": "{@b Resources}. 大多数大学都有广泛的图书馆和博物馆，你可以进入这些地方。你可以找人帮忙，以获得一般不展出的资源--危险的遗物或可能的魔法物品、法术书，以及类似物品。此外，你大学的教师可能会让你向各个领域的专家咨询--只要你能把他们从工作中哄走。",
	"{@b Training}. Because you're associated with the university, you receive a discount on any education you wish to pursue. When you undergo training as a downtime activity (as described in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} or {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}), you pay only one-half the normal cost, assuming that what you are studying is something the university teaches. Training in languages, musical instruments, and other tools might also be available, at the DM's discretion. In addition, you can gain proficiency in the {@skill Arcana}, {@skill History}, {@skill Nature}, or {@skill Religion} skills by this method, as if you were learning a language. A character can only learn one of these skills in this way.": "{@b Training}. 因为你与大学有联系，你在任何你想接受的教育上都能得到折扣。当你作为停工活动接受培训时（如{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}或{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|XGE}所述），你只需支付正常费用的二分之一，假设你所学的是大学所教的东西。语言、乐器和其他工具的训练也可能会有，由DM决定。此外，你可以通过这种方法获得{@skill Arcana}、{@skill History}、{@skill Nature}或{@skill Religion}技能的熟练度，就像你在学习一门语言一样。一个角色只能用这种方法学习其中一个技能。",
	"A group sponsored by a university might look very much like any other adventuring party, with a range of diverse skills and capabilities. The only significant distinction lies between characters who are scholars and those who are more traditional adventurers. Consider some or all of these roles for characters in your party:": "一个由大学赞助的团体可能看起来很像其他的冒险队伍，拥有一系列不同的技能和能力。唯一重要的区别在于学者角色和传统的冒险家角色之间。考虑为你的队伍中的角色设置一些或所有这些角色。",
	"{@b Field Researcher}. The academic in your group might also be a character with plenty of training and experience in the dangerous life of an adventurer. Sometimes called tomb raiders or grave robbers, such characters know that groundbreaking work requires firsthand experience with the creatures, cultures, forces, and histories being investigated, and the best way to get that is in the field. This role is similar to the Scholar, but the Field Researcher is armed with combat-oriented spells that supplement the knowledge-focused capabilities of the Scholar, preparing them to face those who guard the world's greatest secrets.": "{@b Field Researcher}. 你的小组中的学者也可能是一个在冒险家的危险生活中受过大量训练和有经验的角色。有时被称为盗墓者或盗墓者，这类角色知道，开创性的工作需要对被调查的生物、文化、力量和历史有第一手的经验，而获得这种经验的最好方式就是在野外。这个角色与学者类似，但实地研究者拥有战斗导向的法术，以补充学者以知识为中心的能力，使他们准备好面对那些守护世界最伟大秘密的人。",
	"{@b Financier}. Whether they're hunting for grants or seeking donations from wealthy philanthropists, the Financier seeks the funds to pay for academic expeditions. Such characters might know their ways around ballrooms, boardrooms, and seedy taverns, willing to do whats necessary to get what they need. Those in this role often exude Charisma and might be adept with the {@skill Deception}, {@skill Intimidation}, and {@skill Persuasion} skills. Bards and rogues make natural academic Financiers, as do those with the charlatan and noble backgrounds.": "{@b Financier}. 无论他们是在寻找资助还是从富有的慈善家那里寻求捐赠，金融家都会寻求资金来支付学术考察的费用。这样的人物可能知道他们在舞厅、会议室和肮脏的酒馆的方式，愿意做必要的事情来获得他们所需要的东西。这种角色常常散发着魅力，并且可能擅长（1%）、（2%）和（3%）的技能。吟游诗人和流氓是天然的学术金融家，那些有游侠和贵族背景的人也是如此。",
	"{@b Research Assistant}. Whether their seeking to graduate, get published, or make their academic mark, the Research Assistant's fate is likely tied up in the success of another scholar or a specific project. Alternatively, the Research Assistant might just be along for the ride, helping a professor merely to pass a course. Regardless, such characters might come from any class or background and could have skills gathered from experiences far outside the academic sphere. While there are certainly legitimate Research Assistants who honestly pursue their studies, this role might suit characters without academic interests.": "{@b Research Assistant}. 无论他们是想毕业，还是想发表文章，或是想在学术上有所建树，研究助理的命运很可能与另一位学者或某个特定项目的成功联系在一起。另外，研究助理也可能只是顺水推舟，只是为了帮助教授通过一门课程。无论如何，这样的人物可能来自任何阶层或背景，并可能拥有从学术领域以外的经验中收集的技能。当然也有合法的研究助理，他们真诚地追求他们的研究，这个角色可能适合没有学术兴趣的人物。",
	"{@b Scholar}. Likely possessing a high Intelligence score and a focus on learning and research, the Scholar in your party might represent the academic emphasis of the university. This character is often a noncombatant, a professor or student the rest of the party protects. Alternatively, they might live a dual life, shedding their academic persona as soon as they're off campus grounds. The Scholar might also be a nonplayer character, or the role could be filled by a player character whose spells and training don't include combat. A wizard whose spellbook is filled with utility-focused spells makes a fine Scholar, as might some clerics and monks. In any case, the sage background is an obvious choice for the Scholar, with acolyte and hermit also providing fine alternatives. Proficiency in skills such as {@skill Arcana}, {@skill History}, {@skill Investigation}, {@skill Nature}, and {@skill Religion} often proves useful for this character.": "{@b Scholar}. 学者可能拥有较高的智力分数，并专注于学习和研究，你的队伍中的学者可能代表大学的学术重点。这个角色通常是一个非战斗人员，是一个教授或学生，受到其他成员的保护。另外，他们也可能过着双重生活，一旦离开校园，就摆脱了他们的学术身份。学者也可以是一个非玩家角色，或者由一个其法术和训练不包括战斗的玩家角色来扮演这个角色。巫师的法术书中充满了以实用为重点的法术，就像一些牧师和僧侣一样，可以成为一个好的学者。在任何情况下，圣人背景都是学者的明显选择，圣徒和隐士也提供了不错的选择。熟练掌握{@skill Arcana}、{@skill History}、{@skill Investigation}、{@skill Nature}和{@skill Religion}等技能通常对这个角色很有用。",
	"Decide as a group, in consultation with your DM, what kind of work your group does for the university. Consult the Scholarly Missions table to determine what sort of adventures you undertake.": "以小组为单位，与你的管理员协商，决定你的小组为大学做什么样的工作。请参考学术任务表，以确定你们进行什么样的冒险。",

	"{@b Historical Research}. Your team's work involves learning more about Eberron's long history.": "{@b Historical Research}. 你的团队的工作包括了解更多关于Eberron的悠久历史。",
	"{@b Radical Engineering}. The birth of a new race wasn't the peak of magical and mechanical engineering, it was just the beginning of new scientific fields you now explore.": "{@b Radical Engineering}. 一个新种族的诞生并不是魔法和机械工程的高峰，它只是你现在探索的新科学领域的开始。",
	"{@b Exploration}. Khorvaire is a vast continent, and areas beyond the heartland of the Five Nations are poorly charted. Your focus is on understanding the wilder places of the world, as well as distant cultures.": "{@b Exploration}. Khorvaire是一个广阔的大陆，而五国中心地带以外的地区则没有什么地图。你的重点是了解世界上比较荒凉的地方，以及遥远的文化。",

	"{@b Anonymous}. Try as you might, you can't earn positive or negative attention. Even worse, after you've published your findings, more prominent scholars have made similar statements to much acclaim.": "{@b Anonymous}. 无论你怎么努力，你都无法赢得正面或负面的关注。更糟糕的是，在你发表了你的发现之后，更多的知名学者也发表了类似的声明，获得了很多赞誉。",
	"{@b Misguided}. Your theories challenge scholarly consensus and are discounted. A prominent scholar argues against your conclusions, and their voice carries the day... for now.": "{@b Misguided}. 你的理论挑战了学术界的共识，被打了折扣。一位著名的学者反对你的结论，他们的声音在今天起到了作用......暂时是这样。",
	"{@b Fringe}. You work on the edges of your field, advocating bizarre theories that challenge scholarly consensus and seem patently outrageous, even scandalous.": "{@b Fringe}. 你在你的领域的边缘工作，主张挑战学术界共识的怪异理论，看起来显然很离谱，甚至是丑闻。",
	"{@b Fraud}. For right or wrong, many in the academic community believe you have invented at least some of your \"findings\" to earn attention.": "{@b Fraud}. 无论对错，学术界的许多人认为你至少编造了一些你的 \"发现 \"来赚取关注。",
	"With a university as your patron, you are part of a sprawling bureaucracy—maybe deep in the tangles of it or, more likely, lingering at the edges. Wherever you sit in the network of colleges, administrators, and faculty, a single person serves as your primary point of contact, someone who has a significant impact on the nature of your relationship with the university. Reference the University Contact table to help determine who manages the relationship between you and the university.": "以大学为靠山，你是一个庞大的官僚机构的一部分--也许是深陷其中，或者更有可能是在边缘徘徊。无论你在学院、行政人员和教师的网络中处于什么位置，都有一个人作为你的主要联系人，这个人对你与大学关系的性质有重大影响。参考大学联系表以帮助确定谁管理你和大学之间的关系。",
	"An overworked department head who doesn't quite know what to make of you but gives you work to keep you busy": "一个工作过度的部门主管，他不太了解你的情况，但给你工作让你忙碌。",
	"A career bureaucrat who insists you file paperwork in multiple offices in order to get anything done": "一个职业官僚，坚持要你在多个办公室提交文件，才能完成任何事情。",

In it, ir'Morgrave vows to put an end to the criminal activities occurring within the university and bolster the school's academic reputation. As regular readers of this paper know, he makes such promises frequently, but we have yet to see him take any substantive action to back up his promises.": "针对上周的独家报道，详细介绍了从莫格莱夫大学的仓库中取出珍贵古董并在黑市上出售的计划，Larrian ir'Morgrave大师发表了一份声明，其中充满了我们已经习惯于从大学校长办公室听到的通常的陈词滥调和空洞承诺。在声明中，IR'Morgrave发誓要结束发生在大学里的犯罪活动，并加强学校的学术声誉。正如本报的普通读者所知，他经常做出这样的承诺，但我们还没有看到他采取任何实质性行动来支持他的承诺。",

As a noble, entertainer, or sage, you might have your roots in the City of Lights.": "昂代尔的首都是艾伯伦最美丽的城市之一。令人惊叹的魔法光和其他奥术奇迹的展示增强了精致的建筑。这里是威纳恩大学的所在地，一个著名的机构，吸引着来自整个霍尔韦尔的学生。作为一个贵族、艺人或圣人，你可能在灯光之城扎根。",
	"Before the war, the Arcane Congress served all Galifar. The most promising students from across Khorvaire came to study at Arcanix, and students from Khorvaire, Cyre, and Aundair worked together to win honor in the Trials of the Ninefold Path. Known to students simply as the Nine, this contest pits students of the eight traditions against one another in a series of arcane challenges, along with a ninth bracket for those who have yet to select a tradition. Teamwork, independence, memorization, innovation—the Nine challenges competitors on many levels, and the finest wizards of Galifar were invariably champions of the Nine.": "在战争之前，阿卡尼克斯大会为整个加利法尔服务。整个霍尔韦尔最有前途的学生来到阿卡尼克斯学习，来自霍尔韦尔、赛尔和昂代尔的学生们一起努力，在九幽之路选拔赛中赢得荣誉。被学生们简称为 \"九道\"，这场比赛让八个传统的学生在一系列的奥术挑战中相互对决，同时还有第九个括号，供那些尚未选择传统的人使用。团队合作、独立、记忆、创新...... \"九 \"在许多方面对竞争者提出挑战，而加利法尔最优秀的巫师总是 \"九 \"的冠军。",
	"Thanks to the Treaty of Thronehold, students of all nations once again study side by side in the towers of Arcanix. But no treaty or ritual can easily dispel the tensions of a century of war. Over the last year we've reported on a number of hate crimes in the towers fueled by nationalist passions. Optimistic teachers hope that the Nine will showcase the diversity that has evolved over the course of the past century—highlighting Karrnathi advances in necromancy and evocation, Cyran illusions, and more. But privately, professors fear that the competitive aspect of the Nine will inflame nationalist tension. Some even believe that the lives of foreign students could be endangered should they defeat Aundairian champions.": "由于《王权条约》的签订，所有国家的学生再次在阿卡尼克斯的塔楼上并肩学习。但任何条约或仪式都无法轻易消除一个世纪以来的紧张局势。在过去的一年里，我们已经报道了一些由民族主义激情所引发的塔楼仇恨犯罪。乐观的老师们希望，九人组将展示在过去一个世纪中发展起来的多样性--强调卡尔纳提在死灵法术和唤醒方面的进步，赛伦的幻术，等等。但私下里，教授们担心九人组的竞争性方面会激起民族主义的紧张情绪。有些人甚至认为，如果外国学生打败了昂代尔的冠军，他们的生命就会受到威胁。",
	"Only time will tell if the Nine can bring us together as it once did, or if it will drive us further apart.": "只有时间会告诉我们，九人帮是否能像以前那样把我们聚集在一起，或者是否会使我们进一步分离。",
	"Located on the shores of Lake Galifar, the city of Passage is the heart of the dragonmarked House Orien. Resources include production and maintenance facilities for the lightning rail and the Orien caravans. If you have the Mark of Passage, odds are good you've spent time here.": "位于加利法尔湖畔的帕萨奇城是龙纹家族奥瑞恩的中心。资源包括闪电轨道和奥瑞恩商队的生产和维护设施。如果你有通行证的标记，你很可能在这里呆过。",
	"This island city is the seat of House Lyrandar, and Queen Aurala allows the house a free rein in governing the isle. It is the finest resort and vacation spot in Khorvaire. Spies, charlatans, sailors, and house agents all have a place in Stormhome. Even though the island escaped the devastation wrought during the Last War, it remains a hotbed for clandestine activities.": "这个岛屿城市是Lyrandar家族的所在地，Aurala女王允许该家族自由管理这个岛屿。它是霍尔韦尔最好的度假村和度假地。间谍、骗子、水手和家族代理人都在风暴之家拥有一席之地。尽管该岛躲过了上次战争的破坏，但它仍然是秘密活动的温床。",
	"Lyrandar wizards use magic to continuously alter Stormhome's weather, turning the otherwise bleak and storm-blasted location into a temperate island getaway.": "Lyrandar巫师使用魔法不断地改变Stormhome的天气，将原本暗淡无光、被暴风雨侵袭的地方变成一个温润的岛屿度假胜地。",
	"Aundair and Thrane were bitter rivals during the Last War. Thrane seized the ancient city of Thaliost during the war and holds it to this day. Most of the people of Aundair remain furious about the occupation of Thaliost, but the city has become a haven for Aundairians who revere the Silver Flame.": "昂代尔和瑟兰在最后的战争中是激烈的对手。瑟兰在战争中夺取了古老的塔利奥斯特城，并将其保留到今天。大多数昂代尔人对萨利奥斯特的占领仍然感到愤怒，但这座城市已经成为崇尚银色火焰的昂代尔人的天堂。",
	"The Eldeen Reaches seceded from Aundair halfway through the Last War. The western farmers rebelled over high taxes and neglect, allying with the druids of the Towering Wood. Aundair was forced to accept the sovereignty of the Reaches under the terms of the Treaty of Thronehold, but many Aundairians view it as a renegade nation.": "在最后一次战争的中途，艾尔迪恩河谷从昂代尔分离出来。西部的农民因为高额的税收和忽视而起义，与高耸森林的德鲁伊结盟。根据《王权条约》的条款，昂代尔被迫接受该地区的主权，但许多昂代尔人认为它是一个叛逆的国家。",
	"Extensive use of magic has repaired most of the damage to the cities of Aundair, but the countryside remains scarred by the war, especially along the border with Thrane. The Crying Fields are a region of farmlands permanently scarred by magic and haunted by restless spirits. Aundairians claim their nation is stronger than ever, but some worry about the long-term impact of the loss of the Eldeen farmlands and the Crying Fields.": "魔法的广泛使用修复了昂代尔城市的大部分损失，但农村仍然因战争而伤痕累累，尤其是在与瑟兰的边界。哭泣的田野是一个被魔法永久伤痕累累的农田区域，被不安的灵魂所困扰。昂代尔人声称他们的国家比以往任何时候都要强大，但有些人担心失去艾尔迪恩农田和哭泣之地的长期影响。",
	"Now, Aundairians debate over differing views of their nation's future. Some believe the first focus should be reuniting Aundair and the Eldeen Reaches, whether through diplomacy or force. Others consider Thaliost to be the pressing issue. And still others support Queen Aurala's claim to the throne of Galifar. When creating an Aundairian, consider whether you have ties to any of the affected regions and if this influences your opinion of Thranes or druids.": "现在，昂代尔人对他们国家的未来有不同的看法而争论。一些人认为首要的焦点应该是统一昂代尔和艾尔迪恩河谷，无论是通过外交还是武力。其他人则认为塔利奥斯特才是最紧迫的问题。还有人支持奥拉拉女王对加利法尔王位的要求。在创建昂代尔人时，考虑你是否与任何受影响的地区有联系，以及这是否会影响你对瑟兰斯或德鲁伊的看法。",

	"The Brelish are known for their pragmatism and independence. They lack the discipline of Karrns and the faith of the Thranes, but they excel at finding innovative solutions to problems. The Brelish also have a talent for intrigue and subterfuge. The King's Dark Lanterns is one of the finest intelligence agencies in Khorvaire, rivaled only by House Phiarlan and the Trust of Zilargo. The dark side of these aptitudes is a strong streak of cynicism, which allows crime and corruption to flourish in Brelish cities and temples. The Sovereign Host is the dominant religion of Breland, but in general the Brelish aren't as devout as citizens of other nations.": "布雷利什人以其实用主义和独立性而闻名。他们缺乏卡尔人的纪律和瑟兰人的信仰，但他们擅长寻找解决问题的创新方案。布雷利什人也有阴谋诡计的天赋。国王的黑暗灯笼是霍尔韦尔最好的情报机构之一，只有皮亚伦家族和齐拉尔戈的信托公司可以与之匹敌。这些能力的阴暗面是强烈的愤世嫉俗，这使得犯罪和腐败在布雷利什的城市和寺庙中盛行。主权者是布瑞尔的主要宗教，但一般来说，布瑞尔人并不像其他国家的公民那样虔诚。",

	"{@b Slightly Shady}. Many Brelish have a loose relationship with the law. Even if you're a hero, you might have questionable connections or friends in low places.

You could also be a folk hero who challenges the laws to protect the innocent, or an entertainer who plays in every dive in Sharn.": "{@b Slightly Shady}. 许多Brelish与法律的关系松散。即使你是个英雄，你也可能有可疑的关系或在低处的朋友。诸如罪犯、间谍或江湖术士等背景可以反映出这种倾向，无论你的阶级如何。你也可以是一个挑战法律以保护无辜者的民间英雄，或者是一个在沙恩的每个潜水点表演的艺人。",
