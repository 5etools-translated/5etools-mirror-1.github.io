	"This whole Plane Shift thing started because of Zendikar. It's hard to imagine a Magic plane better suited for D&D adventuring than the one that was conceived, from start to finish, as \"adventure world.\" Making the transition from The Art of Magic: The Gathering—Zendikar to Plane Shift: Zendikar was thus perfectly natural. Innistrad came next, bolstered by the happy coincidence of the Curse of Strahd adventure coming out close to the same time. Then with Plane Shift: Kaladesh, I got to stray a little further from the core D&D experience, presenting a fairly fast and loose take on reskinning D&D magic items into the aether-powered inventions of Kaladesh. And now we come to Amonkhet—a desert plane inspired by ancient Egypt, ruled by an evil dragon Planeswalker, and which features one small safe haven from an undead infestation. It is not a traditional D&D setting. The trials of the five gods provide the most obvious structure for a campaign set on Amonkhet. A group of initiates from the same crop might go through the trials together, and those trials alone could form the entirety of a short campaign. To flesh out the experience, characters could also undertake missions on the behalf of gods or viziers: defending the Hekma, joining the gods on a hunting expedition in the desert, and so on. The campaign could get complicated with the addition of viziers, who normally do not go through the trials (unless they choose to), or if any or all of the characters become dissenters. Perhaps the best way to think of an Amonkhet campaign is that it takes place against the backdrop of the five trials, rather than being all about the trials. The trials provide a structure and a sense of drama, but relationships among characters—and between characters and the rest of the world—are where the meat of the story unfolds. You could set your campaign in the period leading up to when initiate player characters undergo one of the trials, with the trial as a climax to the whole story. You could use the Trial of Solidarity and the Trial of Ambition as a framing device for the campaign, to explore issues of collective unity versus personal achievement. (Initiate characters would undergo the Trials of Knowledge and Strength on their own terms.) Or you could ignore the trials entirely and focus on dissenter characters trying to upset the social order of Naktamun. As always, The Art of Magic: The Gathering—Amonkhet is the definitive resource for information about the plane. With this document, you can use that information to build a campaign with a minimum of changes to the fifth edition D&D rules, which you can find here. And even without the book, you can find lore about Amonkhet on the Magic web site. Good luck in the trials!": "整个位面转换的事情是因赞迪卡而起的。很难想象有哪个魔法位面比这个从头到尾都被设想为 \"冒险世界 \"的位面更适合D&D的冒险活动。从《魔法的艺术：集会-赞迪卡》过渡到《空间转移》。因此，从《魔法：集会-赞迪卡》过渡到《空间转换：赞迪卡》是非常自然的。接下来是Innistrad，这是因为Strahd的诅咒冒险在同一时间推出，这是个很好的巧合。然后是 \"空间转移\"。Kaladesh时，我又偏离了D&D的核心经验，将D&D的魔法物品改头换面成了Kaladesh的乙太动力发明，呈现出一种相当快速和松散的方式。现在我们来到了阿蒙凯特--一个受古埃及启发的沙漠平面，由一个邪恶的龙行者统治，它的特点是有一个小的安全避难所，不受亡灵侵扰。这不是一个传统的D&D背景。五神的考验为阿蒙凯特的活动提供了最明显的结构。一群来自同一作物的新成员可能会一起经历试炼，而这些试炼本身就可以构成一个短期活动的全部内容。为了充实经验，人物还可以代表神或大臣执行任务：保卫赫克马，加入神在沙漠中的狩猎探险，等等。如果增加了宰相，活动就会变得复杂起来，因为宰相通常不经历试炼（除非他们选择），或者如果任何或所有角色都成为异议者。也许对阿蒙凯特战役最好的看法是，它发生在五个审判的背景下，而不是全部关于审判。审判提供了一个结构和一种戏剧感，但是人物之间的关系--以及人物与世界其他地方的关系--才是故事展开的关键所在。你可以把你的战役设置在启动玩家角色接受其中一个试验之前的阶段，把试验作为整个故事的高潮。你可以用 \"团结的考验 \"和 \"野心的考验 \"作为活动的框架装置，来探讨集体团结与个人成就的问题。(初始角色将根据自己的条件接受知识和力量的考验）。你也可以完全不考虑试炼，而把重点放在试图破坏纳克塔蒙社会秩序的异议人物上。一如既往，《魔法：集会的艺术--阿蒙凯特》是关于这个平面的权威信息资源。有了这份文件，你就可以利用这些信息来建立一个活动，只需对第五版D&D规则进行最少的修改，你可以在这里找到这些规则。即使没有这本书，你也可以在魔法网站上找到关于阿蒙凯特的传说。祝你在试验中好运!",
	"Towering, gold-encrusted monuments break the unending monotony of a horizon formed of sun-blasted sand. Awe-inspiring, animal-headed gods walk among the people, offering them care and protection from the horrors of the desert. A wide, life-giving river offers its abundant bounty, providing for every physical need. Happy, hopeful people offer sacrifices in grand temples dedicated to their benevolent gods, addressing their spiritual needs. For they know that this life, as wonderful as it might be, is just the beginning—a prelude to the perfection that awaits them in the afterlife, promised to them by their God-Pharaoh.": "高耸的镶金纪念碑打破了由阳光照射的沙子形成的地平线的无休止的单调。令人敬畏的兽头神走在人们中间，为他们提供照顾和保护，使他们免受沙漠的恐怖之苦。一条宽阔的、赋予生命的河流提供了它丰富的赏赐，满足了每一个人的生理需求。幸福而充满希望的人们在宏伟的寺庙中为他们仁慈的神灵献上祭品，满足他们的精神需求。因为他们知道，这种生活，尽管可能是美好的，但只是一个开始--在来世等待他们的完美的前奏，这是由他们的神--法老承诺的。",
	"Amonkhet is a plane of dichotomy. Beyond the lush river valley spreads endless scorching desert. Accursed, desiccated mummies roam that desert, while carefully embalmed mummies attend to the needs of the living in the glorious city-state. The people have everything they need. They are protected from the desert heat and wandering mummies by the magical barrier called the Hekma, and they spend their lives in focused training, honing body and mind to perfection. Yet they eagerly anticipate the time when they will be permitted to die in combat and leave this world behind.": "阿蒙凯特是一个二分法的平面。在郁郁葱葱的河谷之外，蔓延着无尽的炙热沙漠。被诅咒的、干枯的木乃伊在沙漠中游荡，而精心防腐的木乃伊则在这个光荣的城邦中满足生活的需要。人们拥有他们需要的一切。他们被称为 \"海克玛 \"的神奇屏障保护着，不受沙漠高温和游荡木乃伊的影响，他们一生都在集中训练，将身体和心灵磨练得完美无缺。然而，他们急切地期待着他们被允许在战斗中死亡并离开这个世界的时候。",
	"On the surface, Amonkhet seems like a marvelous place to live. But something unsettling and nefarious lurks behind the grand facade. The wise and benevolent God-Pharaoh, said to be busy preparing the wondrous afterlife for the worthy, is actually Nicol Bolas—the malevolent dragon Planeswalker whose schemes reach far beyond this plane. And all the preparation and training, all the trials and contests, all the effort to be made worthy—all of this is meant to prepare the people of Amonkhet for transformation into an undead army under Bolas's command.": "从表面上看，阿蒙凯特似乎是一个令人惊叹的生活场所。但在这个宏伟的外表下，却潜伏着一些令人不安和邪恶的东西。智慧和仁慈的神-法老，据说正忙着为有价值的人准备奇妙的来世，实际上是尼科尔-博拉斯--邪恶的龙行者，他的计划远远超出了这个平面。所有的准备和训练，所有的考验和竞赛，所有的努力都是为了让自己变得有价值--所有这些都是为了让阿蒙凯特的人们准备好在博拉斯的指挥下转变为一支亡灵军队。",
	"Unknown to any of the plane's inhabitants, the entire society of Amonkhet has been manipulated by Nicol Bolas, who has seized control of the world, the gods, and the magic of the plane. Bolas chose this plane for his schemes because of the presence of a magical substance called lazotep, which interacts with the magic of necromancy in strange and powerful ways. Conveniently, he also found here a pious, structured civilization that he could easily subvert to his own purposes. Making himself the God-Pharaoh, he brought the gods themselves under his control, and eliminated anyone who tried to stand against him. Then he transformed the world into a factory designed to produce a huge army of perfect undead soldiers—mummies embalmed in lazotep.": "这个星球上的任何居民都不知道，阿蒙凯特的整个社会已经被尼科尔-博拉斯操纵了，他已经控制了这个世界、诸神和这个星球的魔法。博拉斯为他的计划选择了这个平面，因为这里有一种叫做拉索特普的魔法物质，它能以奇怪而强大的方式与死灵魔法发生作用。方便的是，他还在这里发现了一个虔诚的、结构化的文明，他可以很容易地将其颠覆为自己的目的。他把自己变成了神-法老，把众神都置于他的控制之下，并消灭了任何试图反对他的人。然后他把世界变成了一个工厂，旨在生产一支巨大的完美的不死士兵军队--用拉索特普防腐的木乃伊。",
	"Adapting the peculiar magic of the plane, Bolas found a means to preserve the combat skills of the living after death. He has selected five aspects of character that he desires most in his undead soldiers, and has built the society of Amonkhet around a series of trials designed to hone and perfect those aspects of body and mind. Throughout their lives, the people of the plane believe they are drawing nearer to the promised afterlife—and at last they die in the final trial, a mass battle with no survivors. But rather than earning a place in the afterlife, they are instead embalmed in lazotep and stored in Bolas's great necropolis, adding to the ranks of his undead army.": "博拉斯利用这个星球上的特殊魔法，找到了一种在死后保留活人战斗技能的方法。他选择了他最渴望的亡灵士兵的五个方面的性格，并围绕一系列旨在磨练和完善这些方面的身体和心灵的试验建立了阿蒙凯特的社会。在他们的一生中，这个星球上的人们相信他们正在接近承诺的来世--最后他们在最后的试验中死去，这是一场没有幸存者的大规模战斗。但他们并没有在来世赢得一席之地，而是被埋在拉索特普中，存放在博拉斯的大墓园中，增加了他的亡灵大军的队伍。",
	"Part of the magic of Amonkhet that Bolas has been able to exploit is a necromantic phenomenon called the Curse of Wandering. This naturally occurring magic causes any being who dies on the plane to rise again after a short time, cursed with insatiable hunger and an irresistible drive to attack the living. Desiccated mummies created by the Curse of Wandering fill the desert wasteland that dominates the plane, constantly threatening what little life remains. But the people of Amonkhet do not fear the threat of attack as much as they dread the knowledge that all who live will one day die and fall under the same curse. Death under the effect of the Curse of Wandering is a terrifying afterlife filled with endless suffering.": "博拉斯能够利用的阿蒙凯特的部分魔力是一种叫做 \"流浪的诅咒 \"的亡灵现象。这种自然发生的魔法使任何死在这个星球上的人在短时间内复活，并被诅咒为贪得无厌的饥饿和不可抗拒的攻击生者的动力。由 \"流浪的诅咒 \"创造的干枯木乃伊充斥着主宰这个星球的沙漠荒地，不断威胁着仅存的生命。但阿蒙凯特的人们并不害怕攻击的威胁，他们更害怕知道所有活着的人有一天都会死去，并受到同样的诅咒。在 \"流浪的诅咒 \"作用下的死亡是一个可怕的来世，充满了无尽的痛苦。",
	"What God-Pharaoh Nicol Bolas offers to the people of Amonkhet is an alternative to an eternity of wandering: an afterlife of glorious delights. And all they need to do to attain this eternal bliss is prove that they are worthy. As such, the threat of the Curse of Wandering is a strong motivation for people to undergo the trials of devotion that the God-Pharaoh demands.": "神-法老尼科尔-博拉斯为阿蒙凯特的人们提供了一个替代永恒流浪的选择：一个充满光荣乐趣的来世。而他们需要做的就是证明他们是有价值的，才能获得这种永恒的幸福。因此，\"流浪的诅咒 \"的威胁是促使人们接受神-法老所要求的虔诚考验的强大动力。",
	"The inhabitants of Amonkhet, mortal and divine alike, believe that the God-Pharaoh left the five gods as stewards of the populace when he departed to prepare the afterlife. While he is gone, the God-Pharaoh expects the people to devote their lives to proving they are worthy of this great reward. Since the afterlife will be perfect, the people who enter it must also be perfect.": "阿蒙凯特的居民，无论是凡人还是神人，都相信神-法老在离开准备来世的时候，留下了五位神人作为民众的管家。在他离开的时候，神-法老希望人们能用自己的生命来证明他们配得上这个伟大的奖赏。由于来世将是完美的，进入来世的人也必须是完美的。",
	"The gods are custodians of the path to the afterlife, established by the God-Pharaoh to purify and perfect the people who follow that path and undergo its trials. Each god oversees one of five trials, instructing the initiates who prepare to face that trial by helping them cultivate one of the five aspects of mortal perfection.": "众神是通往来世之路的监护人，由神-法老建立，以净化和完善遵循这条道路并接受其考验的人。每位神监督五个试验中的一个，指导准备面对该试验的入门者，帮助他们培养凡人完美的五个方面中的一个。",
	"Oketra the True, the cat-headed god of solidarity, teaches that the worthy shall know and respect all others whom the God-Pharaoh deems as worthy. For in the afterlife, all will be together in purpose and in action.": "团结的猫头神奥克特拉教导说，有价值的人应了解并尊重所有被神-法老认为有价值的其他人。因为在来世，所有人都将在目标和行动上聚在一起。",
	"Kefnet the Mindful, the ibis-headed god of knowledge, teaches that the worthy shall cultivate a nimble mind—one capable of perceiving the wonders beyond imagining that await in the afterlife": "知识之神凯菲特（Kefnet the Mindful），朱鹭头的知识之神，教导有价值的人应培养一个灵活的头脑--能够感知来世等待的超乎想象的奇迹。",
	"Strength. Rhonas the Indomitable, the cobra-headed god of strength, teaches that the worthy shall hone a strong body that can endure throughout an endless life.": "力量。不屈不挠的罗纳斯，眼镜蛇头的力量之神，教导有价值的人应磨练出强壮的身体，使之能承受无尽的生命。",
	"Bontu the Glorified, the crocodile-headed god of ambition, teaches that the worthy shall strive for greatness, as supremacy will be rewarded in the afterlife.": "鳄鱼头的野心之神邦图（Bontu the Glorified）教导说，有价值的人应努力追求伟大，因为至高无上的地位将在来世得到回报。",
	"Hazoret the Fervent, the jackal-headed god of zeal, teaches that the worthy shall rush toward the afterlife with unhesitating fervor. Relentlessly, they will rise to overcome any obstacle in the way of earning a place at the God-Pharaoh's side.": "热情的哈佐雷特，豺狼头的热情之神，教导有价值的人应以毫不犹豫的热情冲向来世。他们将不遗余力地克服任何障碍，争取在神-法老身边获得一席之地。",
	"Initiates who pass one of the trials are awarded a cartouche—a magical emblem they will take with them to the afterlife. The trials culminate in the Trial of Zeal, which is a combat to the death. Dying in this final battle is proof of worthiness, with a glorified death earning the initiate a place in the afterlife. The bodies of the slain are loaded onto funerary barges and sent through the Gate to the Afterlife. But this is not an end. Rather, it marks the beginning of the most wondrous part of an initiate's existence. Each looks forward to death in the final trial, hoping to find a glorious end at the hand of a close friend, so that together, they can live as Eternals in the afterlife with the God-Pharaoh. Forever.": "通过其中一项试验的入门者会获得一个卡图什--一个他们将带着来世的魔法徽章。试验的高潮是狂热试验，这是一场生死搏斗。在这场最后的战斗中死亡是价值的证明，光荣的死亡将为入门者在来世赢得一席之地。被杀者的尸体被装入殡仪馆的驳船，并被送入来世之门。但这并不是一个结束。相反，它标志着入门者存在中最奇妙的部分的开始。每个人都期待着在最后的审判中死亡，希望在一个亲密的朋友手中找到一个光荣的结局，这样他们就可以一起作为永恒的人在来世与神-法老一起生活。永远。",
	"The citizens of Amonkhet begin training for the trials of the five gods at a very young age. Children as young as five years old are invited to become acolytes—the first stage of their spiritual development. An annual ceremony serves as a rite of passage for these youths, marking the beginning of their journey toward the afterlife.": "阿蒙凯特的公民在很小的时候就开始为五神的考验进行训练。年仅5岁的孩子就被邀请成为圣徒--他们精神发展的第一个阶段。一年一度的仪式是这些年轻人的成人仪式，标志着他们走向来世的旅程的开始。"
