	"A handful of characters from the film {@i Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves} are presented here as NPCs you can include in your D&D campaigns. The stat blocks in this collection use a presentation similar to that which is found in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}. If you are unfamiliar with the stat block format, read the introduction of the Monster Manual before proceeding further. That book explains stat block terminology and gives rules for various monster traits—information that isn't repeated here.": "影片中的少数人物（%0%）在此作为NPC呈现，你可以将其纳入你的D&D活动中。本集的状态块采用了类似于{@book Monster Manual|MM}电影中的表现形式。如果你不熟悉状态块的格式，请在进一步阅读《怪物手册》的介绍。那本书解释了状态块的术语，并给出了各种怪物特征的规则--这些信息在此不作重复。",
	"Some creatures have weapons that deal unusual damage types and spellcasting that functions in an atypical way. For example, {@creature Forge Fitzwilliam|TG} deals extra poison damage with his heavy crossbow. This extra damage isn't a feature of the weapon. Such an exception is a special feature of a stat block and represents how the creature uses its weapon or casts its spells; the exception has no effect on how a weapon or spell functions for a different creature.": "有些生物的武器会造成不寻常的伤害类型，而咒语则以非典型的方式发挥作用。例如，（%0%）用他的重弩造成额外的毒药伤害。这种额外的伤害并不是武器的特征。这样的例外是一个状态块的特殊功能，代表了该生物如何使用其武器或施法；该例外对不同生物的武器或法术的功能没有影响。"
