	"Acquisitions Incorporated was founded in Seattle, Washington, in a time spoken of in only hushed tones: the year 2009. It first saw life as a podcast, which, at the time, was an unusual way to play Dungeons & Dragons. The intervening decade saw Acq Inc take on many forms—streams, recorded content, comics, and, of course, live roleplaying shows. While these are all now completely normal ways to discover and enjoy D&D, back then, not so much. We just did it because it seemed like a cool idea, and ten years later, it seems like maybe we were right. Today, Acq Inc's adventures continue, dutifully chronicled online at acq-inc.com.": "收购公司成立于华盛顿州西雅图，当时人们只用沙哑的语调谈论：2009年。它最初是以播客的形式出现的，这在当时是一种不寻常的玩龙与地下城的方式。在这十年间，Acq公司采取了许多形式--流媒体、录制内容、漫画，当然还有现场角色扮演节目。虽然这些都是现在发现和享受D&D的完全正常的方式，但在当时，并不是这样的。我们这样做只是因为这似乎是一个很酷的想法，而十年后，似乎我们是对的。今天，Acq公司的冒险仍在继续，在acq-inc.com网站上尽职地记录着。",
	"Our intention with Acquisitions Incorporated was to bring dark office comedy to a world of swords, sorcery, dungeons, and (dare we say) dragons. This book, created in concert with Wizards of the Coast, sets you up for success in your own fantasy-business endeavors. Chapter 1 provides an orientation for new franchise members, detailing how to start a game and play the Acquisitions Incorporated way. {@book Chapter 2|AI|1} explores the various positions within an Acq Inc franchise, introducing a variety of roles vital to an adventuring enterprise's success. {@book Chapter 3|AI|2} delves into backgrounds for Acq Inc franchise members, entrenching company goals at the core of their beings. In {@adventure Chapter 4|OoW|0}, all this comes together in an adventure taking characters from level 1 to 6, establishing a party's claim on a world they've begun to explore and strip-mine for profit.": "我们编写《收购公司》的目的是将黑暗的办公室喜剧带入一个充满剑、巫术、地牢和（我们敢说）龙的世界。本书是与 \"海岸奇才 \"合作编写的，为你在自己的奇幻事业中取得成功做了准备。第1章为新的特许经营成员提供了一个方向，详细介绍了如何开始一个游戏和以收购公司的方式进行游戏。{@book Chapter 2|AI|1}探讨了Acq Inc特许经营中的各种职位，介绍了对冒险企业的成功至关重要的各种角色。(1%)深入探讨了Acq Inc特许经营成员的背景，将公司的目标牢牢固定在他们的核心位置。在{@adventure Chapter 4|OoW|0}中，所有这些都汇集在一个冒险中，人物从1级到6级，建立了一个政党对他们已经开始探索和开采利润的世界的要求。",
	"Following these chapters, {@book appendix A|AI|3} presents stalwarts of the Acquisitions Incorporated world, founding members and characters from the company's ongoing adventures. {@book Appendix B|AI|11} details foes, from terrifying deep crows to infamous keg robots. {@book Appendices C|AI|12}, {@book D|AI|13}, and {@book E|AI|14} conclude this guide with a variety of Acq Inc tools and treasures, from vehicles like the {@vehicle battle balloon|AI} to the mighty {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}.": "在这些章节之后，{@book appendix A|AI|3}介绍了收购公司世界的中坚力量，公司的创始成员和正在进行的冒险中的人物。(%%1%)详细介绍了敌人，从可怕的深海乌鸦到臭名昭著的水桶机器人。{@book Appendices C|AI|12}、{@book D|AI|13}和{@book E|AI|14}以各种Acq公司的工具和宝物作为本指南的结尾，从{@vehicle battle balloon|AI}等交通工具到强大的{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}。",
	"Many hands worked diligently throughout the process of creating the Acquisitions Incorporated campaign and this resulting book. If you put your ear very close to the pages, you will hear us whisper, \"thank you.\"": "在创建Acquisition Incorporated运动和这本书的整个过程中，许多人都在辛勤地工作。如果你把耳朵贴近书页，你会听到我们轻声说：\"谢谢你\"。",
	"With its roots set firmly in heroic fantasy, D&D might feel out of sync with modern-day business dealings. But the game and its settings are actually a perfect fit for such tropes. What better way to think of the big bad monster at the center of a web of even bigger and badder plans than as the CEO of a megacorporation, using every resource to dominate the market? What is an adventuring party but a limited-liability corporation, with each member contributing specialized skills to growing the brand and expanding a power base?": "由于其根植于英雄主义幻想，D&D可能会感到与现代商业交易不同步。但这个游戏和它的设定实际上是对这种套路的完美诠释。还有什么比作为巨型公司的首席执行官，利用一切资源来支配市场，更能让人联想到处于更大、更坏的计划网络中心的大坏蛋？什么是冒险党，而是一个有限责任公司，每个成员都为发展品牌和扩大权力基础贡献专门技能？",
	"Likewise, hirelings, sidekicks, apprentices, and other paid laborers working for the heroes have been staples of Dungeons & Dragons since the earliest editions of the game. Charisma in AD&D was good for little other than determining how many followers your character might gather—and, more importantly, how much pain and suffering you could put those followers through before they abandoned you. The world of Acquisitions Incorporated returns these hired helpers to prominence for their importance to the campaign story. And, of course, for comic effect.": "同样，从龙与地下城游戏的最早版本开始，雇佣兵、跟班、学徒和其他为英雄工作的有偿劳动者就一直是龙与地下城游戏的主要内容。AD&D中的魅力除了决定你的角色可能聚集多少追随者外，几乎没有其他用处--更重要的是，在这些追随者抛弃你之前，你可以让他们经历多少痛苦和折磨。在《收购公司》的世界里，这些受雇的帮手因其对战役故事的重要性而回归到突出的位置。当然，也是为了达到喜剧效果。",
	"When the characters are relatively low level, an Acquisitions Incorporated style of play can present them with even more hurdles to overcome. The often bizarre, unfeeling, and surreal elements of corporate and business life can add a degree of danger or absurdity to even the most run-of-the-mill adventuring. And as the characters attain higher levels—and their franchise attains higher rank—their connections to Acquisitions Incorporated can help dial up the stakes of any adventure path. In an Acq Inc campaign, every NPC is a potential customer. Every bit of treasure found is an investment in the franchise and its future. Every other would-be hero is the competition, and every villain is the head of Evil Incorporated, just begging for some market volatility.": "当角色的等级相对较低时，收购公司的游戏风格会给他们带来更多的障碍，需要克服。公司和商业生活中经常出现的怪异、无情和超现实的元素可以为最普通的冒险活动增加一定程度的危险或荒诞。随着角色等级的提高，以及他们的特许经营权获得更高的等级，他们与收购公司的联系可以帮助拨高任何冒险路径的风险。在Acq公司的活动中，每个NPC都是一个潜在的客户。每一个发现的宝藏都是对特许经营权和其未来的投资。每一个可能成为英雄的人都是竞争对手，而每一个反派都是邪恶公司的头头，都在等待着市场的波动。",
	"Money, as they say, makes the world go around. And as is true in real life, so it goes in the fantasy realm. The far-reaching power of global corporations allied with political power doesn't just inform our own real world—it molds it. Bringing that concept of powerful corporations working with or against nobility to gain money, power, and influence into D&D adds another layer of depth to the story your campaigns create.": "俗话说，金钱使世界运转。在现实生活中是如此，在幻想领域也是如此。全球性企业与政治权力结盟的深远力量不仅影响了我们自己的现实世界，而且还塑造了它。将强大的公司与贵族合作或反对贵族以获得金钱、权力和影响力的概念引入D&D，为你的活动创造的故事增加了另一层深度。",
	"An Acquisitions Incorporated campaign has a unique texture, because it combines deeply ordinary clerical toil with multiverse-spanning stakes. And in the end, you never know which one of those tropes might save your life.": "一个收购公司的活动具有独特的质地，因为它将普通的牧师工作与跨越多个宇宙的赌注结合起来。最后，你永远也不知道哪一个惯例会救你的命。",
	"Acquisitions Incorporated is high fantasy by way of office comedy. Imagine the Fellowship of the Ring insisting they only trekked from nine to five. Think about Conan barbarously assailing his way up the corporate ladder. Or perhaps King Arthur insisting that Excalibur's real magic lie in brand awareness, or Robin Hood pivoting the Merry Men toward a pyramid scheme.": "收购公司是以办公室喜剧的方式进行的高级幻想。想象一下，\"魔戒团 \"坚持他们只从九点到五点进行跋涉。想想柯南野蛮地攻击他在公司的阶梯上。或者，亚瑟王坚持认为神剑的真正魔力在于品牌意识，或者罗宾汉把快乐的人引向金字塔计划。",
	"Starting your own Acquisitions Incorporated franchise means stepping into a world of possibility. It opens up countless adventure hooks, rules for building and growing your own personalized base of operations, and a way to introduce Acquisitions Incorporated's specific sense of farcical corporate culture, questionable morality, and unfolding narrative to your own game.": "开始你自己的收购公司专营权意味着踏入一个充满可能性的世界。它开辟了无数的冒险钩子，建立和发展你自己的个性化行动基地的规则，以及将收购公司的特定意义上的滑稽企业文化、可疑的道德和展开的叙事引入你自己的游戏的方法。",
	"Within the world of Acquisitions Incorporated, the franchise is the center of brand expansion throughout the world of Faerûn and beyond, even as it provides a new set of tools for player expression and involvement. In a way, it provides players with a greater purpose to explore. And although entirely nonnegotiable, franchise fees are incredibly reasonable.": "在《收购公司》的世界里，特许经营权是整个Faerûn世界和其他地方的品牌扩张的中心，即使它为玩家的表达和参与提供了一套新的工具。在某种程度上，它为玩家提供了一个更大的探索目的。虽然完全没有商量的余地，但特许权费用却非常合理。",
	"Our integrated Intern Success Pathway is a robust, unparalleled system for reliable growth year-on-year while maximizing your downstream.": "我们的综合实习生成功之路是一个强大的、无与伦比的系统，可以实现逐年的可靠增长，同时最大限度地提高你的下游。",
	"Throughout history, some people have had things and other people have wanted those things. But where most would gaze upon that arrangement and see an inescapable life of unfulfillment, {@creature Omin Dran|AI|Ominifis Hereward \"Omin\" Dran} saw a business opportunity. Thus was Acquisitions Incorporated born. In the years since, Omin and longtime employee (though less-longtime friend) {@creature Jim Darkmagic|AI|James Winifred \"Jim\" Darkmagic III} have turned a talent for redistribution of property into a reputation as the multiverse's premier adventurers for hire.": "纵观历史，一些人拥有一些东西，另一些人想要这些东西。但是，当大多数人注视着这种安排，看到的是无法逃避的不满足的生活时，{@creature Omin Dran|AI|Ominifis Hereward \"Omin\" Dran}却看到了一个商业机会。因此，Acquisition Incorporated诞生了。在此后的几年里，奥明和长期雇员（尽管是不太长久的朋友）（1%）已经把重新分配财产的天赋变成了作为多元宇宙的首要冒险家的声誉。",
	"{@creature Omin Dran|AI}, CEO of Acquisitions Incorporated and war priest of Tymora, is the very model of the modern Faerûn business mien. He prioritizes his responsibilities first to his shareholders (which is to say, himself); second to his goddess; and then at some later stage to the well-being of his employees. It's definitely not third. But it's up there somewhere.": "{@creature Omin Dran|AI}，收购公司的首席执行官和Tymora的战神，是现代Faerûn商业行为的典范。他首先对他的股东（也就是他自己）负责；其次是对他的女神负责；然后在后来的某个阶段对他的员工的福利负责。这绝对不是第三。但它是在那里的某个地方。",
	"{@creature Jim Darkmagic|AI} III comes from a long line of renowned wizards, but he turned his back on his family and his inheritance for a life on the stage—at least until well-paid heroics came calling. Jim and Omin's unlikely partnership began when Jim was the only surviving candidate in the running for a hotly contested position with the company. (Any deaths incurred in this process were incidental, and not the result of the actions or negligence of Acq Inc.)": "{@creature Jim Darkmagic|AI}三世出身于著名的巫师世家，但他为了舞台上的生活而背弃了他的家庭和他的遗产--至少在高薪的英雄主义出现之前。吉姆和奥明的不可能的伙伴关系始于吉姆是公司一个竞争激烈的职位中唯一幸存的候选人。(在这个过程中发生的任何死亡都是偶然的，而不是Acq公司的行为或疏忽造成的）。",
	"Acquisitions Incorporated began as most adventuring groups do, with the wholesale removal of irksome kobolds, scouting ruined towers, delving into dwarven necropolis-cities, and abandoning wounded goblin hirelings named Splug to a terrible fate. The usual stuff. But in short order, Acq Inc traded kobolds for dragons, and upgraded ruined towers to eldritch temples. As the company grew, so too did its demand for willing and able-bodied adventurers. However, a limited payroll meant having to settle for one or the other.": "收购公司开始时与大多数冒险团体一样，全盘清除令人讨厌的哥布林，侦察废墟上的塔楼，深入矮人的死城，并将受伤的哥布林雇佣者Splug遗弃在可怕的命运中。这些都是平常的事情。但在短时间内，Acq公司将哥布林换成了龙，并将废墟塔楼升级为长生殿。随着公司的发展，它对有意愿和有能力的冒险家的需求也在增加。然而，有限的薪资意味着必须满足一个或另一个。",
	"After coming to the conclusion that a mission statement best described as \"minion harvesting\" sent the wrong message, Acquisitions Incorporated started an internship program. In accordance with the truism \"you get what you pay for,\" the very first Acq Inc intern died on his second assignment with the company. But like all good leaders, {@creature Omin Dran|AI} understood that truisms cut two ways, and he led the remaining team on a legendary trek through the Nine Hells to recover the soul of said intern. (Clearly, none of those hells paid for him either.)": "在得出 \"收割奴才 \"的使命宣言发出错误信息的结论后，收购公司开始实施实习计划。根据 \"一分钱一分货 \"的道理，收购公司的第一个实习生在他加入公司的第二个任务中就死了。但像所有优秀的领导者一样，{@creature Omin Dran|AI}明白，真理是有两面性的，他带领剩余的团队在九层地狱中进行了一次传奇的跋涉，以恢复上述实习生的灵魂。(显然，这些地狱也没有为他付出代价）。",
	"The rogue {@creature Viari|AI} is one of Acquisitions Incorporated's best internship success stories. In fact, he was so successful that he remained the company's flagship intern for nearly a decade. He first joined Acquisitions Incorporated during an expedition into the {@adventure Undermountain dungeons of Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM} (who, due to an ongoing defamation suit, we can no longer refer to as \"the Mad Mage\"). From regrowing his own arm after an unfortunate incident with the {@i Apocalypse Dagger}, to wrangling dinosaurs to win street races, {@creature Viari|AI} has earned something far more valuable than a regular salary with Acq Inc. He's earned on-the-job experience.": "流氓（%0%）是收购公司最好的实习生成功故事之一。事实上，他是如此成功，以至于他在近十年内一直是公司的旗舰实习生。他第一次加入收购公司是在对{@adventure Undermountain dungeons of Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM}（由于正在进行的诽谤诉讼，我们不能再把他称为 \"疯狂法师\"）的考察中。从在一次与{@i Apocalypse Dagger}的不幸事件后重新长出自己的手臂，到操纵恐龙赢得街头比赛，{@creature Viari|AI}在Acq公司赢得了远比普通工资更有价值的东西。他赢得了在职工作的经验。",
	"Thanks to the company's continuing success and robust internship program, Acquisitions Incorporated has long since outgrown garden-variety slaughter and disregard for public well-being. {@creature Môrgæn|AI}, an elf ranger from the Elsewynn, joined the team as a troubleshooter some time ago, and quickly showed that her propensity for slaughter and disregard for the public well-being is far beyond garden variety.": "由于公司的持续成功和强大的实习计划，收购公司早已不再是花园式的屠杀和对公众福祉的漠视。{@creature Môrgæn|AI}，一个来自埃尔塞文的精灵游侠，前段时间作为故障排除者加入了这个团队，并很快显示出她的屠杀倾向和对公众福祉的漠视远远超出了花园式的范畴。",
	"{@creature Môrgæn|AI}'s recruitment coincided with Acquisitions Incorporated acquiring its first airship. Diviners have theorized that this was no coincidence, but the combined psychic will of all mortal creatures to put as much distance between them and the ranger as possible. More practical minds see the folly in this, since the airship simply gave {@creature Môrgæn|AI} a better vantage point.": "{@creature Môrgæn|AI}的招募恰好与收购公司获得其第一艘飞艇相吻合。占卜者认为这不是巧合，而是所有凡人生物的综合精神意志，让他们与游侠之间的距离越远越好。更实际的人认为这是愚蠢的，因为飞艇只是给了(1%)一个更好的视野。",
	"Beyond the core Acquisitions Incorporated crew, {@creature Omin Dran|AI} has overseen regular strategic expansion of the Acq Inc brand. The \"C\" Team, the \"B\" team, and numerous other franchise operations have been established, flying the Acq Inc flag, bearing the Acq Inc sigil, and—most crucially—paying a cut of the profits into company coffers on a monthly basis.": "除了核心的Acquisition Incorporated团队，{@creature Omin Dran|AI}还负责监督Acq Inc品牌的定期战略扩张。C \"团队、\"B \"团队和许多其他特许经营业务已经建立，悬挂着Acq Inc的旗帜，带有Acq Inc的标志，而且最关键的是，每月向公司库房支付一定的利润。",
	"What the customer wants is not always what the customer needs... or gets.": "客户想要的并不总是客户需要的......或得到的。",
	"In the years between its founding and today, Acquisitions Incorporated has pried deep into the underbelly of Waterdeep, commandeered battle balloons above the jungles of Chult, faced down mechanical beholders, and robbed a bank operated by devils. The team has also rubbed shoulders with some of the most notorious figures in the Forgotten Realms, including bumping into Drizzt Do'Urden while journeying through the Underdark.": "在成立至今的这些年里，收购公司已经深入到水底世界的底层，征用了丘特丛林上空的战斗气球，面对机械人，并抢劫了一家由魔鬼经营的银行。该团队还曾与被遗忘的领域中一些最臭名昭著的人物擦肩而过，包括在穿越暗黑世界时碰到德里兹特-杜尔登。",
	"When {@creature Jim Darkmagic|AI} became afflicted with the Death Curse, there was no definitive proof that this was a direct result of his employment with Acquisitions Incorporated, or had been incurred while on assignment. However, as Omin had already made his stance on the subject of death and termination of employment contracts very clear, he sought to break the curse. Dabbling in some light cloning and contracting the help of a trash witch, the team managed to restore Jim to peak productivity. Never one to waste company resources, Omin also traded Jim's clone to a devil. It seemed prudent at the time.": "当{@creature Jim Darkmagic|AI}受到死亡诅咒的困扰时，没有确切的证据表明这是他受雇于收购公司的直接结果，或者是在执行任务时发生的。然而，由于奥明已经非常清楚地表明了他对死亡和终止雇佣合同问题的立场，他试图打破诅咒。在一些轻度克隆和与一个垃圾女巫签约的帮助下，团队成功地将吉姆恢复到最高生产力。奥明从不浪费公司的资源，他还将吉姆的克隆体交易给了一个魔鬼。这在当时看来是很谨慎的。",
	"However, nothing in Acquisitions Incorporated's storied history encapsulates the company's efficacy better than the recovery of Omin's sister, {@creature Auspicia Dran|AI}, from the Wandering Crypt. The specifics of her initial capture by that dread creature remain shrouded in mystery. Some say it was inspired by the evil actions of Omin's other sister, {@creature Portentia Dran|AI|Portentia}. Some also speculate that as the sole shareholder of Acq Inc, Omin founded the company for the express purpose of rescuing his beloved sister. Acquisitions Incorporated will not be making further statements on the matter at this time.": "然而，在收购公司的传奇历史中，没有什么比从流浪墓穴中救出奥明的妹妹{@creature Auspicia Dran|AI}更能体现该公司的功效了。她最初被那个可怕的生物捕获的具体细节仍然笼罩在神秘之中。有人说这是受到奥民的另一个妹妹（1%）的邪恶行为的启发。也有人猜测，作为Acq公司的唯一股东，Omin创立公司的目的就是为了营救他心爱的妹妹。收购公司目前不会就此事发表进一步声明。",
	"The company's mounting successes have led, of course, to imitators and rivals. The Six, counting among their number a certain left-for-dead goblin now named {@creature Splugoth the Returned|AI}, have been a persistent splinter in the Acq Inc corporate paw for ages. Suggesting that acquisition is a family business, Omin's own sister Portentia now runs and serves a competing company called Dran Enterprises. Originally founded by what turned out to be a false version of Omin's lost sister, Auspicia, Dran Enterprises has long sought to execute a hostile takeover of Acquisitions Incorporated. All such efforts have been skillfully rebuffed, of course, with Acq Inc embracing its place as an always-independent (and clearly superior) operation.": "该公司不断取得的成功当然也导致了模仿者和竞争对手。六人帮，其中有一个已经死去的小妖精，现在被命名为（%0%），长期以来一直是Acq公司企业爪子上的一个分裂体。暗示收购是一项家族事业，奥明的亲妹妹波坦蒂亚现在经营并服务于一家名为德兰企业的竞争公司。德兰企业最初是由奥明失散的妹妹奥斯皮西亚的虚假版本创立的，长期以来一直试图对收购公司实施敌意收购。当然，所有这些努力都被巧妙地回绝了，Acq公司作为一个始终独立的（而且明显优越的）运营机构，拥抱着自己的位置。",
	"Riding its past success into a completely deliberate and planned expansion across the multiverse, Acquisitions Incorporated shows no signs of slowing down. (Because that would likely require self-reflection and measured responses that are historically off-brand.) And that expansion means new franchises. The first step was Ravnica, a city run by guilds and simply overflowing at the practicability of acquisition for hire. But beyond that? Infinite possibilities. Because wherever people want things they don't currently have, Acquisitions Incorporated will be there, asking them to sign.": "利用其过去的成功，在整个多元宇宙中进行了完全审慎和有计划的扩张，收购公司没有显示出放缓的迹象。(因为这很可能需要自我反省和有分寸的反应，这在历史上是不符合品牌要求的）。而这种扩张意味着新的特许权。第一步是拉夫尼卡（Ravnica），一个由行会管理的城市，在雇佣收购的可行性方面简直是泛滥成灾。但除此之外呢？无限的可能性。因为只要人们想要他们目前没有的东西，收购公司就会在那里，要求他们签字。",
	"No time to read the whole book? Who can blame you! (What is this thing, like 200 pages? Yikes.) To get a taste of the awesomeness that is an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise, just roll up any number of critical franchise elements from the tables on this page. (DMs can also do this if they want to shirk the work of creating rival franchises from whole cloth. Slackers.)": "没有时间阅读整本书？谁能怪你呢！（这是什么东西？(这是什么东西，有200多页吗？耶。)要想体验一下收购公司特许权的可怕之处，只需从本页的表格中卷起任何数量的关键特许权元素。(如果DM想推卸创建竞争对手的工作，他们也可以这样做。懒人）。",

This chapter also introduces company positions—a new set of rules for franchise characters granting access to unique, tier-based abilities that can help a party stand out in a crowded marketplace. And because taking a vacation is no excuse for diminished returns, an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise can make use of expanded rules for downtime and franchise activities, allowing players to help shape the business and the narrative of the campaign even when they aren't in the field.": "本章介绍了Acquisition Incorporated的特许经营和经营规则。特许经营的好处是按等级划分的，包括一个不断扩大的商业领地，特许经营总部的广泛选择和升级，以及更多。本章还介绍了公司职位--一套新的特许经营角色规则，授予他们独特的、基于等级的能力，可以帮助一方在拥挤的市场上脱颖而出。因为休假不是收益减少的借口，收购公司的特许经营可以利用扩大的停工和特许经营活动规则，让玩家即使不在现场也能帮助塑造业务和活动的叙述。",
	"A license to operate an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise comes with nearly limitless benefits! When your party starts a franchise, you receive a region in which to operate, a franchise headquarters, and a majordomo to assist with basic headquarters needs. As your characters become accomplished adventurers (and continue to contribute to Head Office coffers), Acquisitions Incorporated helps your franchise gain even greater benefits! See the following {@book Franchise Advancement table|AI|1|Franchise Advancement} for a summary of what you get at each rank.": "经营Acquisition Incorporated特许经营权的许可几乎带来了无限的好处! 当你的队伍开始经营时，你会得到一个经营区域，一个特许经营总部，以及一个协助满足总部基本需求的大佬。当你的角色成为有成就的冒险家时（并继续为总部库房做贡献），收购公司会帮助你的加盟店获得更大的利益 请看下面{@book Franchise Advancement table|AI|1|Franchise Advancement}对你在每个等级中得到的东西的总结。",
	"By default, a franchise rank is gained at each tier of play (beginning at level 1 and advancing when the average party level reaches level 5, 11, and 17). The DM might choose to increase or decrease the level of play at which franchise tiers are gained, or tie advancement to story or campaign goals. Each franchise rank provides characters the opportunity to operate in a larger geographic area, hire staff and direct them to execute franchise tasks, and customize the franchise headquarters.": "默认情况下，每一级游戏都会获得一个特许权等级（从1级开始，当队伍的平均等级达到5级、11级和17级时，就会晋级）。管理者可以选择增加或减少获得特许权等级的游戏级别，或将晋级与故事或活动目标挂钩。每个特许经营等级都为角色提供了在更大的地理区域内经营的机会，雇佣员工并指导他们执行特许经营任务，以及定制特许经营总部。",
	"When a franchise first starts out, it is licensed to operate in a small region focused on a settlement or similar mercantile point. You might think this means Head Office doesn't trust its new franchisees. Not at all! No! It's just so much easier to support a group when they start in a focused area. Don't worry at all that a rival Acquisitions Incorporated franchise will outmaneuver you. It seldom happens. Keep growing your business, and the Acq Inc license will expand to help you find more customers and increase your brand presence.": "当一个特许经营权刚开始时，它被授权在一个小区域内经营，重点是一个定居点或类似的商业点。你可能认为这意味着总部不信任它的新加盟商。根本不是这样的! 不是的! 当一个团体在一个重点地区开始时，支持他们就会容易得多。不要担心竞争对手Acquisition Incorporated的特许经营权会超过你的能力。这很少发生。继续发展你的业务，Acq公司的许可证将扩大，以帮助你找到更多的客户，增加你的品牌影响力。",
	"Within your licensed region, you have the right to use the full power of Acquisitions Incorporated branding. No other Acquisitions Incorporated franchise will operate in your region, and all the region's customers are exclusively yours. Of course, non-Acquisitions Incorporated rival organizations might be present. You are expected to drive them out of business. (Or give them untimely deaths. You do you.) A franchise can build or operate any number of locations, such as warehouses and trade shops, within its region. You may not maintain property or establish formal operations in a settlement outside your region, even if you ship goods to that location.": "在你的许可区域内，你有权使用Acquisitions Incorporated品牌的全部力量。在你的区域内，没有其他收购公司的特许经营权，该区域的所有客户都是你的专属。当然，非收购公司的竞争对手组织可能会出现。你要把他们赶出企业。(或者让他们过早地死去。你做你的。)一个特许权可以在其区域内建立或经营任何数量的地点，如仓库和贸易商店。你不能在你的地区之外的定居点维持财产或建立正式的业务，即使你把货物运到那个地方。",
	"You may not use the Acquisitions Incorporated brand outside your licensed region without written, documancer-generated permission, since those areas might belong to other licensees. You can adventure outside your territory, of course, and can assist or work for other organizations. However, you are expected to prioritize missions given to you by Head Office.": "没有书面的、文档管理员生成的许可，你不能在你的许可区域之外使用Acquisition Incorporated的品牌，因为这些区域可能属于其他被许可人。当然，你可以在你的领地之外冒险，也可以协助或为其他组织工作。但是，你应该优先考虑总部给你的任务。",
	"Acquisitions Incorporated grants your franchise a license to operate in a settlement, and in a territory around the settlement approximately 10 miles across. If your region includes a coastline, you are granted the rights to engage in sea trade within that region. You can ship goods (over land, water, or air) to one city or other settlement outside your region. (The DM approves this location, and might wish to establish your franchise's relationship with it through play as part of the campaign.)": "收购公司授予你的特许经营权，可以在一个定居点和定居点周围约10英里范围内经营。如果你的地区包括一个海岸线，你被授予在该地区从事海上贸易的权利。你可以将货物（通过陆地、水路或空中）运送到你所在地区以外的一个城市或其他定居点。(DM批准这个地点，并可能希望通过作为战役一部分的游戏来建立你的专营权与它的关系。)",
	"Your license now expands to include a region similar in size to a province or a small kingdom—typically up to 50 miles across, with your starting settlement somewhere within. (For mapping purposes, this area is roughly the same scale as a province-scale map. See \"{@book Mapping Your Campaign|DMG|1|Mapping Your Campaign}\" in chapter 1 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}.) You are expected to expand your trade and branding throughout the region. You'll seize new markets, develop new offerings, increase your network of contacts, and safeguard the king and queen's spoiled kids so the monarchs think of you positively. You can ship goods to two cities or other settlements outside your region.": "你的许可证现在扩展到包括一个类似于省或小王国大小的区域--通常是50英里宽，你的起始定居点在其中的某个地方。(为了绘图的目的，这个区域的规模与一个省规模的地图大致相同。参见《{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}》第一章中的\"{@book Mapping Your Campaign|DMG|1|Mapping Your Campaign}\"。你要在整个地区扩大你的贸易和品牌效应。你要抢占新的市场，开发新的产品，增加你的关系网，并保护国王和王后宠爱的孩子，让君主们对你有积极的看法。你可以将货物运往你所在地区以外的两个城市或其他定居点。",
	"An Acquisitions Incorporated franchise is a group effort. Many decisions must be made in the course of running a franchise and playing in an Acq Inc campaign, and it is assumed that all players will be involved in making those decisions. Whenever this book talks about a franchise collectively—and in particular, when it talks about decisions being made by a franchise—the understanding is that all characters (in the game) and all players (at the table) have an equal say in determining a franchise's fortunes and fate. Sure, arguments will crop up from time to time. But that kind of roleplaying is a big part of what makes an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign.": "收购公司的特许经营权是一个团体的努力。在经营特许经营权和参与Acq Inc活动的过程中，必须做出许多决定，而且假定所有玩家都会参与做出这些决定。每当本书谈到特许经营权时，特别是谈到特许经营权所做的决定时，我们的理解是，所有的角色（在游戏中）和所有的玩家（在桌子上）在决定特许经营权的财富和命运方面都有平等的发言权。当然，争论会不时地出现。但这种角色扮演是收购公司活动的一个重要组成部分。",
	"Your license grows to include a broad expanse of provinces, a few small kingdoms, or a large kingdom or federation, covering a territory the size of half the Sword Coast in the Forgotten Realms campaign setting. A large territory might overlap with other Acquisitions Incorporated regions, though you are theoretically working with (and perhaps overseeing) smaller franchises rather than working against them. You can ship your goods to any destination, and can assign staff to a city to which you ship goods—solely to oversee the distribution of those goods, and certainly not to compete with rivals. Don't cause too much trouble and Head Office will stay happy.": "你的特许权发展到包括广阔的省份、几个小王国或一个大王国或联邦，覆盖的领土面积相当于《被遗忘的王国》战役背景中的半个剑海岸。一个大的领地可能会与其他收购公司的地区重叠，尽管理论上你是在与（也许是在监督）较小的专营权合作，而不是与它们作对。你可以将你的货物运往任何目的地，并可以向你运送货物的城市派驻工作人员--只是为了监督这些货物的分销，当然不是为了与对手竞争。不要造成太多麻烦，总部会保持快乐。",
	"Your franchise now includes specific locations located on other planes of existence. These could include such fabled trading locations as Sigil, the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire, or a githyanki outpost in the Astral Plane. Your license to operate in these regions is not exclusive. Your region on the Material Plane might or might not expand, depending on both your performance and the goals of the campaign. The DM might establish extraplanar locations through play. Failing—or succeeding—in securing an extraplanar location could create interesting and deadly rivalries!": "你的特许经营权现在包括位于其他存在平面上的特定地点。这些地方可能包括传说中的贸易地点，如Sigil，火元素位面的黄铜城，或星界的吉特安基前哨。你在这些地区的经营许可并不具有排他性。你在物质界的区域可能会也可能不会扩张，这取决于你的表现和活动的目标。DM可能通过游戏建立星外地点。失败或成功地获得一个星外地点，可能会产生有趣的、致命的竞争!",

	"{@book Chapter 5|PHB|5|Services} of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} details the costs for characters to hire skilled and untrained hirelings. As is true of characters in any campaign, Acquisitions Incorporated franchisees are free to hire any NPCs they want, within whatever limitations the DM wants to set on such employment. But the franchise itself comes with a number of staff whose wages are part of the franchise's cost, providing not only labor but story potential.": "{@book Chapter 5|PHB|5|Services}的{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}详细说明了角色雇佣熟练和未训练的雇佣者的费用。如同任何战役中的角色一样，收购公司的特许经营人可以自由地雇佣任何他们想要的NPC，在DM想对这种雇佣设置的任何限制范围内。但特许经营权本身也有一些员工，他们的工资是特许经营权成本的一部分，不仅提供了劳动力，还提供了故事的潜力。",
	"Each franchise rank grants a number of new staff members who live in the franchise headquarters or within its geographic scope. The cost of maintaining staff is included in a franchise's costs. Each staff member has a proficiency bonus equal to 2 + the franchise's rank. For skilled hirelings or crew, the DM might substitute NPC statistics when that seems appropriate. Each time a franchise gains a rank, existing staff members can be gifted with early retirement (that is, fired), and replaced alongside new hires that fit the franchise's needs.": "每个特许经营等级都会授予一些居住在特许经营总部或其地理范围内的新工作人员。维持员工的费用包括在加盟店的成本中。每个员工都有一个相当于2+特许权等级的熟练度奖励。对于熟练的雇佣者或工作人员，DM可以在适当的时候用NPC的统计数字来代替。每当特许经营权获得一个等级，现有的工作人员就可以被赠予提前退休（也就是被解雇），并由符合特许经营权需求的新雇员取代。",
	"A franchise might engage all kinds of hirelings and agents over the course of a campaign, but specialized franchise staff fall into four different categories.": "在活动过程中，一个特许经营机构可能会雇用各种雇佣人员和代理人，但专门的特许经营人员可分为四种不同的类型。",
	"An employee is like a friend you pay.": "雇员就像你付出的朋友。",
	"A majordomo administers a franchise headquarters. They typically reside within the headquarters and seldom leave it, sending out communications through a dedicated messenger (at no extra cost, and traveling on foot or by means the franchise provides). A majordomo is proficient in Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) and two skills of the DM's choice.": "主事人负责管理一个特许经营总部。他们通常居住在总部内，很少离开总部，通过专门的信使（不需要额外的费用，步行或乘坐特许经营权提供的交通工具）来发送通信。大领主精通魅力（（%0%））和DM选择的两个技能。",
	"The DM is encouraged to use the rules for creating nonplayer characters in {@book chapter 4|DMG|4|Designing NPCs} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} to detail the majordomo, giving this individual a vibrant personality and backstory. The majordomo's goals should be aligned with the franchise and with Acquisitions Incorporated as a whole, allowing them to properly act as an ally and steward for the party.": "我们鼓励DM使用{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中关于创建非玩家角色的规则来描述大领主，给这个人一个充满活力的个性和背景故事。大领主的目标应该与特许经营权和收购公司整体保持一致，使他们能够适当地充当党的盟友和管家。",
	"It can be helpful to a campaign to provide the majordomo with a backstory that complements a franchise's evolution over time. A sage might research how the franchise gains new capabilities. Or perhaps the majordomo was the pilot of a vessel capable of planar travel, who slowly applies those features to the headquarters. A majordomo of a franchise modeling itself after a spy organization might constantly invent devices for the franchise, making continuing progress as the party returns with gold, lore, and resources.": "为圣人提供一个背景故事，以补充特许经营权随时间的演变，这对活动是有帮助的。圣人可能会研究特许经营权如何获得新的能力。也可能主子是一艘能够进行平面旅行的船只的驾驶员，他慢慢地将这些功能应用到总部。一个以间谍组织为模型的特许经营权的主要负责人可能会不断为特许经营权发明设备，当党派带着金子、传说和资源回来时，就会不断取得进展。",
	"A franchise's majordomo can take a company position (see the next section) in addition to the positions taken by the characters. Especially with a small party, it can be good to have a majordomo fill a useful position that no character wants to take. No other NPCs can take company positions.": "特许经营的主事人除了担任人物的职务外，还可以担任公司的职务（见下一节）。特别是在一个小团队中，让一个主事人担任一个没有角色愿意担任的有用职位是很好的。其他NPC不能担任公司职位。",
	"As described in the \"{@book Services|PHB|5|Services}\" section in chapter 5 of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, untrained hirelings provide general labor, and can function as builders, cleaners, porters, and other workers. Untrained hirelings can work for a franchise or its allies, perhaps tending a garden for a noble family or helping a merchant unload cargo from ships. They will not engage in combat and do not leave the headquarters to join the party on adventures.": "正如《(1%)》第五章的\"{@book Services|PHB|5|Services} \"部分所描述的，未经训练的雇佣兵提供一般的劳动，可以作为建筑工、清洁工、搬运工和其他工人。未经训练的雇佣兵可以为一个专营机构或其盟友工作，也许是为一个贵族家庭打理花园或帮助商人从船上卸货。他们不会参与战斗，也不会离开总部加入党的冒险活动。",
	"The DM should name at least one hireling who acts as a leader for any interactions with groups of untrained laborers. Providing hirelings with a similar background (such as a band of ex-soldiers or reformed criminals) can add personality to the group. Consider using the rules in {@book chapter 4|DMG|-1} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, applying the results of a single set of rolls to the entire group. Those hirelings could all shave their heads zealously, be brawny but absentminded, play various musical instruments, use colorful oaths and exclamations, and so on.": "DM应该至少指定一个雇佣者，在与未经训练的劳动者群体的任何互动中充当领导者。提供具有类似背景的雇佣者（比如一队退役士兵或改过自新的罪犯）可以为这个团体增加个性。可以考虑使用{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中的规则，将一组卷轴的结果应用于整个团体。那些雇工都可以热心地剃光头，身强力壮但心不在焉，会演奏各种乐器，使用丰富多彩的誓言和感叹词，等等。",
	"Group ideals, bonds, and flaws, along with a shared history, can all add depth to a group of untrained hirelings. Those musicians might be connected by the ideal of tradition, and bound to the franchise to protect a cultural heirloom they value above all else. Their flaw and secret could be that they stole the heirloom from their former employer, a rival merchant organization. Over time, the same hirelings might show up as part of the characters' adventures time and time again, revealing aspects of their past and creating story continuity.": "团体的理想、纽带和缺陷，以及共同的历史，都可以为一群未经训练的雇佣者增加深度。那些音乐家可能被传统的理想所联系，并被约束在保护他们最重视的文化传家宝的特许经营权上。他们的缺陷和秘密可能是他们从他们的前雇主--一个敌对的商人组织--那里偷来了这个传家宝。随着时间的推移，同样的雇工可能会一次又一次地出现在人物的冒险中，揭示他们的过去，创造故事的连续性。",
	"What the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} calls untrained hirelings are often referred to as \"subemployees\" within an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise, while skilled hirelings typically gain the more prestigious title of \"intern.\" It's entirely up to individual franchisees what awesome titles they bestow upon their staff members in addition to (or, indeed, in lieu of) perks such as an occasional wage.": "{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}所说的未经训练的雇佣者在收购公司的特许经营中通常被称为 \"次级雇员\"，而熟练的雇佣者通常获得 \"实习生 \"这一更有声望的称号。除了偶尔的工资等福利外，他们赋予员工什么了不起的头衔（或者，事实上，代替了），完全取决于各个加盟商。",
	"A skilled hireling has one or more skill, weapon, or tool proficiencies. A franchise can request skilled hirelings when needed (up to the maximum allowed by franchise rank), with the players describing the concept behind the hirelings and selecting one proficiency for each. The DM can then customize the hirelings as desired, perhaps by adding additional proficiencies or adjusting their combat statistics.": "一个熟练的雇佣兵有一个或多个技能、武器或工具的熟练度。当需要的时候，一个特许经营商可以申请熟练的雇佣兵（在特许经营商等级允许的最大限度内），由玩家描述雇佣兵的概念，并为每个雇佣兵选择一种熟练度。然后，管理员可以根据需要定制雇佣兵，也许可以增加额外的熟练度或调整他们的战斗统计。",
	"Skilled hirelings can be fired and hired as needed. A franchise might bring on a couple of thugs to act as distraction during a street fair, then release those NPCs to hire a different set of skilled hirelings to conduct franchise tasks and downtime activities.": "熟练的雇佣者可以根据需要被解雇和雇佣。一个特许经营商可能会在一个街头集市上雇佣几个打手来分散注意力，然后释放这些NPC来雇佣不同的熟练雇工来执行特许经营任务和休息时间的活动。",
	"Hirelings cannot perform more than one task at a time. A full complement of skilled hirelings assisting the party on a mission precludes other skilled hirelings from helping with franchise tasks and downtime activities until the mission is completed. As with untrained hirelings, detailing a group background and assigning personality characteristics to a group leader can make for a fun play experience.": "雇佣兵不能同时执行一个以上的任务。如果一个熟练的雇佣兵在任务中协助团队，那么在任务完成之前，其他熟练的雇佣兵就不能帮助完成特许任务和休息时间的活动。与未经训练的雇佣兵一样，详细描述一个团体的背景并为一个团体的领导者分配个性特征可以带来有趣的游戏体验。",
	"Characters can adventure with up to one skilled hireling at a time. An NPC with a challenge rating of roughly half the franchise rank works well for most adventures, providing utility without disrupting balance. The loyalty system described in {@book chapter 4|DMG|4|Optional Rule: Loyalty} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} can be used to determine whether the hireling remains dedicated to the party's goals, or the DM can make that decision on the basis of how the adventure plays out and the characters' attitude toward the adventuring NPC.": "角色每次最多可以和一个熟练的雇佣者一起冒险。一个挑战等级大约为特许权等级一半的NPC对大多数冒险来说都很有效，在不破坏平衡的情况下提供效用。{@book chapter 4|DMG|4|Optional Rule: Loyalty}中描述的忠诚度系统可以用来决定雇佣者是否仍然致力于党的目标，或者DM可以根据冒险的发展情况和角色对冒险NPC的态度来做出决定。",
	"Skilled hirelings can also be assigned to franchise tasks, as described in the \"Franchise Tasks and Downtime\" section later in this chapter.": "熟练的雇工也可以被分配到特许经营任务中，如本章后面的 \"特许经营任务和停工 \"部分所述。",
	"Hirelings are kindling in the fire of opportunity!": "雇工是机会之火中的火种!",
	"Crew are skilled hirelings trained in tasks pertaining to the physical maintenance of a franchise (for example, servers or gardeners) or the navigation of a mobile headquarters (sailors for a seagoing franchise, engineers for a giant hollow statue, and so on). Crew do not leave a franchise and cannot perform franchise tasks. They typically run rather than fight back when attacked, though the DM can decide otherwise. If a mobile franchise headquarters requires more crew than is granted by the franchise's rank, the characters must hire the remainder (typically at the skilled hireling cost of 2 gp per day).": "船员是受过训练的熟练雇工，他们的任务是与专营店的物理维护（例如，服务器或园丁）或移动总部的导航（航海专营店的水手，巨大空心雕像的工程师，等等）有关。船员不会离开专营店，也不能执行专营店的任务。在受到攻击时，他们通常会逃跑而不是反击，不过DM可以决定不这样做。如果一个移动的特许经营总部需要比特许经营等级所赋予的更多的船员，那么人物必须雇用剩余的船员（通常以每天2戈比的熟练雇工费用）。",
	"Hiring crew can become a cooperative roleplaying activity. Potential crew might hear of Acquisitions Incorporated or the party's exploits and come to interview with the franchisees. Choices might be offered by the DM, as between a team of ex-militia who lost their last battle and a crew of recently released criminals who swear they were wrongly imprisoned. Names, personalities, and roles can be assigned to crew by the DM and the players. Rather than simply interacting with the cook and the first mate, the characters can instead deal with Pepper, the chef who loves spicy foods, and Brazen, the veteran sailor who always talks back, creating the potential for entertaining interactions as the franchise grows.": "雇用船员可以成为一种合作性的角色扮演活动。潜在的船员可能会听说收购公司或党的探索，并前来与特许经营人面谈。DM可以提供一些选择，比如在一队上次战败的前民兵和一队最近被释放的、发誓说自己被错误监禁的罪犯之间选择。名字、性格和角色可以由DM和玩家分配给船员。角色不是简单地与厨师和大副互动，而是可以与喜欢吃辣的厨师Pepper和总是顶嘴的老水手Brazen打交道，随着特许经营权的增加，创造出有趣的互动潜力。",
	"Acquisitions Incorporated Head Office provides the members of each franchise with a place to call their own. It might not be initially impressive (cleaning any old blood stains is the franchisees' responsibility). But over time, characters in an Acq Inc campaign are granted resources to help construct the headquarters of their dreams! Each franchise rank affords the characters a number of choices, allowing customization and creativity. Sample features are provided as guidelines, but a franchise's features can include literally anything decided on and agreed to by the players and the DM.": "收购公司总部为每个加盟店的成员提供一个属于他们自己的地方。它最初可能并不引人注目（清理任何旧的血迹是加盟商的责任）。但随着时间的推移，Acq Inc活动中的人物会获得资源，以帮助建造他们梦想中的总部 每个特许经营等级都为角色提供了许多选择，允许定制和创造。我们提供了一些特征样本作为指导，但一个特许经营权的特征可以包括由玩家和管理员决定和同意的任何东西。",
	"When selecting a feature, the characters must make decisions together—meaning the players must do the same. Deciding on the features of a headquarters should be a team effort, both in game and around the table. What should a headquarters look like initially? Do the characters prefer to travel by land or by sea, or to operate from a fixed location? Is a ruined keep more interesting than an old vine-covered wizard's tower in the woods? Is the headquarters remote or within a settlement—perhaps an old tavern or caravansary the characters can restore?": "在选择特征时，人物必须共同做出决定--也就是说，玩家也必须这样做。决定总部的特征应该是一个团队的努力，无论是在游戏中还是在餐桌上。总部最初应该是什么样子的？角色们喜欢从陆地或海上旅行，还是从一个固定的地点行动？一个被毁坏的堡垒是否比森林中被藤蔓覆盖的老巫师塔更有趣？总部是在偏远地区还是在一个定居点内--也许是一个古老的小酒馆或商队，角色可以修复？",
	"It can be helpful to think ahead as well. Acquisitions Incorporated is known for mobile franchises, helping to bring goods and adventuring services to distant locations. When a franchise headquarters becomes mobile, will it fly or sail? Will it gain the power to teleport across the land? Will it sprout legs and walk?": "提前思考也会有帮助。收购公司以移动特许经营而闻名，帮助把货物和冒险服务带到遥远的地方。当一个特许经营总部成为移动的时候，它将飞翔还是航行？它是否会获得在陆地上传送的能力？它是否会长出腿来走路？",
	"Everything depends on the type of headquarters. The top of a wizard's tower might detach and shoot skyward like a missile. Or a franchise's headquarters might be contained within a giant statue, which over time gains the power to move farther and faster. A castle or other stationary structure could contain a portal or teleportation circle, allowing the characters to travel to distant locations while the stronghold remains behind.": "一切都取决于总部的类型。巫师的塔顶可能会分离出来，像导弹一样射向天空。或者一个特许经营的总部可能包含在一个巨大的雕像中，随着时间的推移，雕像会获得更远更快的移动能力。城堡或其他固定的结构可以包含一个传送门或传送圈，允许人物前往遥远的地方，而据点却留在后面。",
	"There are a lot of perks to being an intern that people overlook. The hours are very flexible, you get a 20 percent discount in the gift shop, you get a bathroom break every four hours as long as you ask your supervisor first. And sometimes if you go into the conference room after a meeting, there will be a bunch of soda and leftover subs. You can just take as much as you want! As long as nobody sees you.": "作为一名实习生，有很多人们忽视的好处。工作时间非常灵活，你在礼品店可以得到20%的折扣，只要你先问一下你的主管，每四小时就有一次卫生间休息。有时，如果你在会议结束后进入会议室，会有一堆苏打水和吃剩的潜艇。你可以想吃多少就吃多少! 只要没有人看到你。",
	"The characters' collective skill proficiencies, tool proficiencies, backgrounds, and positions within their franchise could all impact the design and construction of a headquarters. A glassblower might make beautiful stained-glass windows, while a herbalist fills the headquarters with pleasing or mysterious scents. An acolyte could outfit a small area of the headquarters as a chapel, while a sage sources a unique desk at which to work. Such features are cosmetic or limited in impact, but enable players to feel more interested and invested in their headquarters.": "角色的集体技能熟练度、工具熟练度、背景以及在其特许经营范围内的地位都可能影响总部的设计和建造。一个玻璃工可能会制作漂亮的彩色玻璃窗，而一个草药师则会让总部充满令人愉悦或神秘的气味。圣徒可以把总部的一小块地方布置成小教堂，而圣人则可以找到一张独特的办公桌来工作。这些功能是外观上的，或影响有限，但能使玩家对他们的总部感到更有兴趣和投入。",
	"Each franchise's starter headquarters is a mundane site, which has often been selected or handed down by Acquisitions Incorporated. The characters' initial base of operations could be a ruined tower, a worn horse-drawn carriage, a beat-up fishing boat, a dilapidated store or farm, or any similar structure or site. The DM might direct the characters toward a single ideal location, or might provide a range of options for players and characters to choose from. And of course, many potential franchise locations will have an interesting past—a haunted mansion, a mysterious lighthouse, an old wizard's tower filled with malfunctioning magic, and so forth.": "每个特许经营权的启动总部都是一个平凡的地方，通常是由收购公司选择或传授的。角色最初的行动基地可以是一座破败的塔楼、一辆破旧的马车、一艘破旧的渔船、一个破旧的商店或农场，或任何类似的结构或地点。管理员可能会将角色引向一个理想的地点，也可能提供一系列的选择供玩家和角色选择。当然，许多潜在的特许经营地点都会有一个有趣的过去--一座闹鬼的豪宅、一座神秘的灯塔、一座充满故障魔法的老巫师塔，等等。",
	"The DM approves the headquarters concept and decides how large or small the initial structure can be, as well as any useful features. DMs and players can work together to create a map of the headquarters and its surroundings. {@book Chapter 5|DMG|-1} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} can help detail both wilderness and urban locations.": "DM批准总部的概念，并决定初始结构的大小，以及任何有用的功能。DM和玩家可以共同创建一张总部及其周围环境的地图。{@book Chapter 5|DMG|-1}的{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}可以帮助详细说明荒野和城市的位置。",
	"Whenever characters are in residence at their franchise headquarters, they can automatically benefit from a minimum lifestyle—poor at rank 1, modest at rank 2, comfortable at rank 3, and wealthy at rank 4. The normal costs associated with that lifestyle for franchisees and select staff are subsumed within the overall cost of running the franchise. Outside the franchise headquarters, normal lifestyle expenses apply.": "每当人物居住在他们的特许经营总部时，他们可以自动受益于最低限度的生活方式--等级1为贫困，等级2为适度，等级3为舒适，等级4为富裕。与这种生活方式相关的加盟商和特定员工的正常费用被归入经营加盟店的总成本中。在特许经营总部之外，正常的生活方式费用适用。",
	"Many franchisees will use their starter headquarters as a point for expansion, adding new features, new rooms, new levels—and, of course, new magic as the franchise grows in rank. Other campaigns might be better served by having the franchise change headquarters at different stages. Characters might start out in a ship, then move to a castle, then take possession of a unique magical headquarters in the end. Any potential headquarters site might be discovered by the characters as part of the campaign, or sites might be suggested or allocated by Head Office.": "许多加盟商会把启动总部作为一个扩张点，增加新的功能、新的房间、新的级别--当然，随着加盟店等级的增长，还会有新的魔法。其他的活动可能会在不同的阶段让特许经营权更换总部，这样做效果更好。角色可以从一艘船开始，然后转移到一座城堡，最后拥有一个独特的魔法总部。任何潜在的总部地点都可以由人物在活动中发现，或者由总部建议或分配。",
	"Any of the following suggestions can make a great starter headquarters, or can provide inspiration for other headquarters features.": "以下任何建议都可以成为一个伟大的启动总部，或者可以为其他总部的功能提供灵感。",
	"Raided by orcs who left no one alive? Those are probably just stories. And even if true, the orcs won't come back (probably). This abandoned lighthouse headquarters is strong enough to stand against any storm (probably), and many of the leaks have been fixed already. And just look at that cool light up top, and the oversized storage cellar. Docks close by are perfect for a starter franchise that comes into possession of a boat, and are also a sign of the lighthouse's importance to coastal trade. Commandeering it will likely win over the locals and maybe even the region's royalty!": "被兽人突袭，没有人活着？这些可能只是故事。即使是真的，兽人也不会再来了（可能）。这个废弃的灯塔总部足够坚固，可以抵御任何风暴（可能），而且许多漏水处已经被修复。再看看上面那盏很酷的灯，还有超大的储藏室。附近的码头很适合拥有船只的初创企业，这也是灯塔对沿海贸易的重要性的标志。征用它很可能会赢得当地人，甚至是该地区的皇室成员的青睐！\"。",
	"Any franchise can take to the seas in this new (okay, very used) {@vehicle keelboat}! Pirates killed the previous owners, and Head Office picked it up for an excellent price. Most of the holes in the hull are repaired, and the sails are only a little bit moldy. Even better, there's a small covered area in the rear protected from the elements that makes a perfect living space! The keelboat holds a half-ton of cargo, and might even come with reduced docking fees at some ports of call.": "任何加盟商都可以开着这艘新的（好吧，很旧的）（%0%）出海! 海盗杀死了以前的主人，总部以一个很好的价格把它买了下来。船体上的大部分洞都被修复了，而船帆也只是有点发霉。更妙的是，在后部有一个小的有盖区域，免受外界影响，是一个完美的生活空间! 这艘龙骨船可以容纳半吨货物，甚至可能在一些港口减免停靠费。",
	"Statistics for a standard {@vehicle keelboat} are found in {@table Owning a Ship; Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles|DMG|chapter 5} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}. The DM might adjust the number of people the boat can comfortably carry, but having such a headquarters typically implies that most franchise staff are itinerant or live elsewhere in whatever settlement is the boat's primary port of call.": "一个标准的{@vehicle keelboat}的统计数据可以在{@table Owning a Ship; Airborne and Waterborne Vehicles|DMG|chapter 5}的{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中找到。DM可能会调整该船可舒适承载的人数，但拥有这样一个总部通常意味着大多数特许经营人员是流动的，或者住在其他地方，无论该船的主要停靠港是什么定居点。",
	"I don't have rivals. I have partners who simply don't know it yet.": "我没有对手。我有伙伴，只是他们还不知道而已。",
	"With just a little work and some better furniture, this place could be the talk of the town. The tavern is certainly not haunted. Seriously, no one listens to those rumors. But if it were, and if the story was spun the right way, the marketing potential could be huge. Some even say that the ghosts (which totally don't exist) like to sing, so that's a plus! The kitchen is already stocked with plates, mugs, and lots of knives, and a few rooms upstairs are ready to rent out to travelers.": "只要稍加修整，加上一些更好的家具，这个地方就能成为镇上的话题。这家酒馆当然不会闹鬼。说真的，没有人听那些传言。但是，如果是这样，如果故事被正确地传播，其营销潜力可能是巨大的。有些人甚至说，鬼魂（完全不存在）喜欢唱歌，所以这是一个加分项。厨房里已经放好了盘子、杯子和很多刀子，楼上的几个房间已经准备好出租给旅行者。",
	"This humble, worn carriage, previously owned by a now-defunct trading company, makes a perfect starter headquarters. The carriage's exterior is weathered wood, and the interior seats and cushions have seen better days. Still, it offers all the perks of home plus the ability to change the neighbors every time you take to the road.": "这辆简陋、破旧的马车，以前由一家现已倒闭的贸易公司拥有，是一个完美的启动总部。马车的外表是风化的木头，内部的座椅和坐垫也已经过了好几天。尽管如此，它仍然提供了家庭的所有好处，而且每次上路都能改变邻居的身份。",
	"The rear of the carriage features a generous cargo space for up to 500 pounds of goods, and is protected from the weather. The horses are hardworking and love apples. The carriage has AC 11 and 75 hit points, and moves at the speed of its {@creature Draft Horse||draft horses} (40 feet). Four passengers can ride inside, two up front with one steering, and two atop the rear cargo area. Up to three people can also sit on the roof of the cabin, for an especially exciting perch when the cart is moving quickly!": "马车的后部有一个宽敞的货物空间，可容纳500磅的货物，并且可以避开天气。马匹很勤劳，喜欢吃苹果。马车的AC值为11，命中率为75，移动速度为其（%0%）（40英尺）。里面可以坐四个人，两个人在前面，一个人掌舵，两个人在后面的货物区上面。最多三个人也可以坐在车厢顶上，当马车快速移动时，可以有一个特别刺激的栖息地!",
	"Because this sort of franchise typically can't hold the characters and all their staff (at least not comfortably), such staff are often itinerant or based in whatever settlement the carriage returns to most often.": "因为这种特许经营通常无法容纳人物和他们所有的工作人员（至少不舒服），所以这种工作人员往往是流动的，或者驻扎在马车最常返回的任何定居点。",
	"A cosmetic improvement, gained at franchise rank 2, allows a franchise to radically alter the look and feel of its headquarters. A beat-up wagon could become a gilded carriage, with luxurious interiors and servants dressed in matching finery. A tavern could proudly display the party's kills in the drinking hall, feature mugs gathered from dwarven holds around Faerûn, and have decor matching a particular theme.": "在特许经营等级2级时获得的外观改进，允许特许经营权从根本上改变其总部的外观和感觉。一辆破旧的马车可以变成一辆镀金的马车，有豪华的内饰和穿戴整齐的仆人。一家酒馆可以在饮酒大厅里自豪地展示党的杀戮，以从法鲁恩附近的矮人仓库收集的杯子为特色，并有符合特定主题的装饰。",
	"Improvements can also be of a fantastic or magical nature, such as flickering magical torches or portraits that watch and interact with observers. The DM has final approval over such improvements, and is the arbiter as to whether cosmetic improvements might provide any actual benefits during play. When allowed, such benefits should be situational and limited. A foe might become distracted the first time a ghostly figure appears in a haunted tavern, but the quality of the illusion is such that it doesn't stand up to continued scrutiny.": "改进也可以是梦幻般的或魔法性质的，例如闪烁的魔法火把或能观察并与观察者互动的肖像。DM拥有对此类改进的最终批准权，并且在游戏过程中，外观改进是否会提供任何实际的好处，他是仲裁者。在允许的情况下，这种好处应该是情景性的和有限的。敌人可能会在幽灵般的人物第一次出现在闹鬼的酒馆里时分心，但这种幻觉的质量是经不起继续审查的。",
	"Cosmetic effects can also be focused on selling and branding a franchise, such as adding manufacturing capabilities, a light-up sign, a customer showroom or service center, and other commercial features. At the DM's discretion, such features might generate additional income or lower the costs of certain franchise tasks.": "美容效果也可以集中在销售和品牌的特许经营上，如增加制造能力、发光标志、客户展示厅或服务中心，以及其他商业功能。由DM决定，这些特征可能会产生额外的收入或降低某些特许经营任务的成本。",
	"This once-innocuous seagoing vessel has been detailed to appear as a brass dragon. The ship's interior is decorated in draconic art, and platforms among the rigging are linked by silk ropes attached to pulleys. These might provide benefits to crew trained in their use if the ship is ever attacked.": "这艘曾经毫不起眼的海船已经被细化为一条铜龙。船的内部装饰有龙的艺术，索具中的平台由连接在滑轮上的丝绳连接。如果这艘船受到攻击，这些东西可能会给受过训练的船员带来好处。",
	"In the entrance hall of a former-wizard's-tower headquarters, enchanted portraits display visages of the franchise's recently vanquished foes. Smaller portraits throughout the tower display important moments in the franchise's adventuring history, and the whole interior is set with magical lighting, decorated with candelabra, and features drapes and carpets matching the franchise's chosen motif.": "在一个前巫师塔总部的入口大厅里，被施了魔法的画像显示了特许经营项目最近被征服的敌人的形象。整个塔内较小的画像显示了特许经营历史上的重要时刻，整个内部设置了神奇的灯光，用烛台装饰，并配有符合特许经营所选主题的窗帘和地毯。",
	"At rank 2, an expansion feature allows a franchise to double the size of its headquarters. When doing so, players and characters can define the changes to the current configuration. Perhaps the headquarters expands in size laterally, or gains an extra floor. Perhaps a new basement is excavated—or poking around the existing basement reveals a secret level of dungeons heretofore unknown.": "在等级2，扩张功能允许特许经营权将其总部的规模扩大一倍。当这样做时，玩家和角色可以定义当前配置的变化。也许总部的面积会横向扩大，或者增加一个楼层。也许开凿了一个新的地下室，或者在现有的地下室周围探查，发现了以前不为人知的地下城的秘密层。",
	"Franchise members can decide on what features are involved in the expansion, including new windows, doors, and furniture. Adding certain types of space might also call for extra supporting features. If storage is on an upper floor, a winch might be installed to lift goods. A cellar could add another exit and an area for storing wine or alchemical supplies. Or a carriage headquarters could gain a second cart to become a wagon train.": "特许经营成员可以决定扩建涉及哪些功能，包括新窗户、门和家具。增加某些类型的空间也可能需要额外的支持功能。如果存储在上层，可能会安装一个绞盘来提升货物。一个地窖可以增加另一个出口和一个储存葡萄酒或炼金用品的区域。或者一个马车总部可以获得第二辆马车，成为一列马车。",
	"All construction is low cost but functional, as in the following examples.": "所有的建筑都是低成本的，但功能齐全，如以下例子。",
	"The lighthouse is now taller, with two additional levels, an upgraded beacon, and a stronger exterior. A stairway leads down into a network of old caverns, including some used as storage space, and finally onto a small beach with a dock.": "现在的灯塔更高了，增加了两层，升级了灯塔，外观也更坚固了。一条楼梯通向一个古老的洞穴网络，包括一些用作储存空间的洞穴，最后到达一个有码头的小海滩。",
	"The building adjacent to the tavern has been bought out and connected to it, allowing for more guest chambers, a larger common room, a larger kitchen, and staff quarters. A large fireplace fills the common room with light and warmth, while new tables and chairs create a welcome environment. Guest chambers might feature a patio or balcony.": "与酒馆相邻的建筑已被买下，并与之相连，从而有了更多的客室，一个更大的公共房间，一个更大的厨房，以及员工宿舍。一个大的壁炉使公共房间充满了光线和温暖，而新的桌子和椅子创造了一个受欢迎的环境。宾客室可能有一个天井或阳台。",
	"Also at rank 2, every franchise gains some form of mobility, with players and DM working together to determine how a headquarters facilitates travel (or expands on its normal travel modes) from one location to another. A ship might gain a magic sail, or could add a balloon to become a battle balloon airship. A hollow statue could gain the ability to stride across the landscape. A wizard's tower might teleport from place to place. Or doors within a tavern could be revealed as a magical portal connected to various locations in far-flung lands.": "同样在等级2，每个特许经营权都会获得某种形式的流动性，玩家和DM共同决定总部如何促进从一个地方到另一个地方的旅行（或在其正常的旅行模式上进行扩展）。一艘船可能会获得一个魔法帆，或者可以增加一个气球，成为一个战斗气球飞艇。一座空心雕像可以获得在景观上大步流星的能力。一座巫师的塔可能会从一个地方传送到另一个地方。或者酒馆里的门可以显示为一个神奇的入口，连接到遥远的土地上的各个地方。",
	"The DM has final approval over the method of locomotion, and can put in place any reasonable limitations or constraints on that movement. Additionally, any method of movement should have a weakness or drawback determined by the DM. As a rule of thumb, a mobile headquarters can travel a distance of 30 miles per day (equivalent to a fast travel pace) per franchise rank. This rate of travel can vary depending on weather, visibility, availability of maps, or other conditions.": "管理部对运动方法有最终批准权，并可以对该运动设置任何合理的限制或约束。此外，任何运动方法都应该有一个由军需官确定的弱点或缺点。作为一个经验法则，一个移动总部每天可以走30英里的距离（相当于快速旅行的速度），每一个特许等级。这个旅行速度可以根据天气、能见度、地图的可用性或其他条件而变化。",
	"A 100-foot-tall stone statue has stairs and rooms carved within its interior. When a character sits at the helm located in a room within the statue's head, the statue can be directed to walk across the land. The statue ignores difficult terrain, usually by simply crashing through it. However, the navigator has a limited sight line while peering out through the statue's large eyes. When the terrain is cluttered or subject to combat conditions, it can be hard to avoid creatures or objects smaller than a large building.": "一座100英尺高的石雕内部刻有楼梯和房间。当一个角色坐在位于石像头部的房间里的舵手处时，可以指挥石像在陆地上行走。雕像无视困难的地形，通常会简单地撞开它。然而，导航员通过雕像的大眼睛向外看时，视线有限。当地形杂乱或受到战斗条件的影响时，就很难避开比大型建筑更小的生物或物体。",
	"A good idea is to swim in the wake of an existing business. Somebody else did the market research and decided this was a good location? Awesome! Now use that decision against them. Set up direct competition. Then spread rumors about them until they're forced to leave the area in shame. Now the market is yours. That's how you business.": "一个好的想法是在现有企业的后面游走。有人做了市场调查并决定这是一个好地方？厉害啊! 现在利用这个决定来对付他们。建立直接竞争。然后散布关于他们的谣言，直到他们被迫羞愧地离开这个地区。现在市场是你的了。这就是你做生意的方式。",
	"A hot air balloon is lit by a magic furnace channeling elemental power. A galleon suspended below the balloon features a helm that controls the ship. The vessel can fly virtually anywhere, ignoring difficult terrain, but it is at risk from storms and strong winds. If the balloon takes significant damage, the ship could be forced to descend—or might even crash.": "一个热气球被一个引导元素力量的魔法炉点燃。悬挂在热气球下面的大帆船有一个控制船只的舵。这艘船几乎可以飞到任何地方，无视困难的地形，但它面临着暴风雨和强风的风险。如果气球受到重大损害，这艘船可能被迫下降，甚至可能坠毁。",
	"({@book Appendix C|AI|12} features vehicle statistics for a typical battle balloon. For characters who choose this highly coveted feature for their headquarters, the DM can impose limitations on the ship's attacks and make changes to its statistics.)": "({@book Appendix C|AI|12}特点是典型的战斗气球的车辆统计。对于那些为他们的总部选择这种令人羡慕的功能的角色，DM可以对该船的攻击施加限制，并对其统计数字进行修改)。",
	"This mobile franchise headquarters features a magical-mechanical locomotive that lays down its own track. Mechanical arms at the front of the locomotive set down crossbars and rails in front of the headquarters at ridiculous speed, while arms at the back of the headquarters pick up the track as it passes. The train moves at quarter speed over difficult terrain (instead of half speed). It can pass over rivers, but cannot cross lakes or large bodies of water.": "这个移动的特许经营总部有一个神奇的机械火车头，可以铺设自己的轨道。机车前面的机械臂以惊人的速度在总部前面放下横杆和铁轨，而总部后面的机械臂则在它经过时拾起轨道。火车在困难的地形上以四分之一的速度移动（而不是半速）。它可以通过河流，但不能跨越湖泊或大型水体。",
	"A seemingly simple wagon drawn by an old horse channels powerful magic. The wagon's driver can cause the wagon to teleport the distance of a day's journey, targeting a known location over the course of one or more extradimensional jumps. Such teleportation is usually done when no one is looking, to avoid arousing suspicion or frightening the locals. Though the wagon eventually arrives at the intended destination, the intervening stop-off points are unknown—and quite possibly perilous.": "一辆由老马拉着的看似简单的马车，却拥有强大的魔法。马车夫可以使马车传送一天的路程，在一次或多次超空间跳跃的过程中瞄准一个已知地点。这种传送通常是在无人注意的情况下进行的，以避免引起怀疑或惊吓到当地人。虽然马车最终到达了预定的目的地，但中间的停留点是未知的，而且很可能是危险的。",
	"Dungeons & Dragons offers a wide range of play styles, and works with many different types of campaign story. The {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} talks about some of the most common types of fantasy that can shape a D&D campaign, including a general sense of campaigns being high magic, low magic, or the D&D standard in between.": "龙与地下城》提供了广泛的游戏风格，并与许多不同类型的战役故事配合。{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}谈到了一些可以塑造D&D活动的最常见的幻想类型，包括一般意义上的活动是高魔法、低魔法或介于两者之间的D&D标准。",
	"An Acquisitions Incorporated campaign has its own distinct feel, as talked about in {@book chapter 1|AI|0} of this book. Part of that feel comes from the substantial benefits that characters gain from franchise features and company positions—mechanical boons, magic items, access to powerful spell effects, and more. These benefits are gained automatically, as a general reward for the characters' adventuring success driving franchise advancement. So it's important that everyone is aware how adding those built-in campaign benefits to the regular magic gained during adventuring will give the characters a boost in power.": "正如本书{@book chapter 1|AI|0}中所谈到的，一个收购公司的活动有其独特的感觉。这种感觉部分来自于角色从特许经营功能和公司职位中获得的大量好处--机械恩赐、魔法物品、获得强大的法术效果，等等。这些好处是自动获得的，作为对人物冒险成功推动特许经营权发展的一般奖励。因此，重要的是，每个人都要知道在冒险过程中获得的常规魔法中加入这些内置的活动福利将如何给角色带来力量上的提升。",
	"For an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign meant to feel and play like standard D&D, the DM should consider creating a low-magic campaign, and letting the benefits of company positions and franchise features fill in the magical gaps. A standard campaign played with the rules in this book should be treated as a high magic campaign, with the DM and the players understanding that the difficulty of encounters and other tasks might need to be ramped up to offer a real challenge to the characters. Of course, nothing prevents anyone from playing a high magic campaign with the Acquisitions Incorporated rules. But DMs and players should all be aware that doing so will create extremely powerful characters—who will no doubt attract extremely powerful enemies and threats as a matter of course.": "对于一个旨在让人感觉和玩起来像标准D&D的收购公司战役来说，DM应该考虑创建一个低魔法战役，并让公司职位和特许经营功能的好处来填补魔法方面的空白。使用本书中的规则进行的标准战役应该被视为高魔法战役，DM和玩家应该明白，遭遇战和其他任务的难度可能需要提高，以给角色带来真正的挑战。当然，没有什么能阻止任何人用 \"收购公司 \"的规则来玩一个高魔法活动。但是，管理员和玩家都应该意识到，这样做会创造出极其强大的角色--毫无疑问，他们会理所当然地吸引极其强大的敌人和威胁。",
	"At rank 2, the members of a franchise can add a weapon to their headquarters, choosing from the options in the \"{@book Siege Equipment|DMG|8|Siege Equipment}\" section of chapter 8 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}. The DM can limit those options or change the details of specific choices, and players can also design unique offensive features, subject to approval by the DM. For example, a walking statue that strikes with a fist could be treated as a ram—or the DM and the players might agree that it would be fun to use some of the effects of {@spell Bigby's hand} for such an attack.": "在等级2时，专营权的成员可以为他们的总部增加一种武器，从{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}第八章的\"{@book Siege Equipment|DMG|8|Siege Equipment} \"部分的选项中选择。DM可以限制这些选项或改变具体选择的细节，玩家也可以设计独特的进攻功能，但要得到DM的批准。例如，一个用拳头击打的行走的雕像可以被当作公羊--或者DM和玩家可能会同意在这样的攻击中使用（%%2%）的一些效果会很有趣。",
	"Most siege weapons (whether mechanical or magical) require two characters, crew, or skilled hirelings to operate, and such weapons might be slow to reload or recharge. Headquarters weapons are not particularly effective against small bands of creatures (such as a group of goblins), but they can be useful against a single large threat (such as a dragon). If siege weapons are abused by franchisees, they might be targeted by enemies, break down, or require costly maintenance each time they are employed in battle.": "大多数攻城武器（无论是机械的还是魔法的）都需要两个人物、船员或熟练的雇工来操作，而且这种武器的装填或充能速度可能很慢。总部武器对小股生物（如一群哥布林）不是特别有效，但对单一的大型威胁（如龙）却很有用。如果攻城武器被加盟者滥用，它们可能会被敌人盯上，发生故障，或者每次在战斗中使用时都需要昂贵的维护。",
	"A giant hollow metal statue acting as a franchise headquarters features a control center from which the statue's arms can be manipulated. One fist can be used per round to strike at foes, using statistics similar to a ram (AC 15, 100 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage).": "一个巨大的空心金属雕像充当特许经营总部，它有一个控制中心，雕像的手臂可以被操纵。每轮可以使用一个拳头来攻击敌人，使用类似于公羊的统计数据（AC15，100点命中率，对毒药和精神伤害免疫）。",
	"{@i Melee Weapon Attack}: +8 to hit, reach 15 ft., one object or creature. {@i Hit}: 16 ({@dice 3d10}) bludgeoning damage.": "{@i Melee Weapon Attack}: 命中率+8，范围15英尺，一个物体或生物。{@i Hit}: 16 ({@dice 3d10})重击伤害。",
	"Magical power can be focused through a lighthouse beacon, requiring 1 round to gather energy and aim. The following round, the energy can be released. The beacon has AC 12, 75 hit points, immunity to poison and psychic damage, and vulnerability to cold. The explosion of energy can be treated as a {@spell scorching ray}, {@spell fireball}, or {@spell lightning bolt} spell, as the DM determines. More powerful features might require more time to recharge, or could be usable only a certain number of times per day. Such attacks might function at longer range but be unable to target creatures or objects within 60 feet of the lighthouse.": "魔法力量可以通过灯塔灯塔来集中，需要1轮来收集能量和瞄准。下一回合，能量可以被释放。灯塔有AC12，75点命中率，对毒药和精神伤害免疫，对寒冷易感。能量的爆发可以被视为{@spell scorching ray}、{@spell fireball}或{@spell lightning bolt}的法术，由DM决定。更强大的功能可能需要更多的时间来充能，或者每天只能使用一定数量的次数。这样的攻击可能在更远的范围内发挥作用，但无法针对灯塔周围60英尺内的生物或物体。",
	"At rank 3, an arcane feature provides a unique magical capability to a headquarters. A haunted headquarters might gain a permanent cohort of friendly undead servants, while a giant statue headquarters could gain the ability to allow the characters to see at great distances and through darkness or fog. A more generic arcane feature could instead grant any franchisee the ability to cast a specific spell of 6th level or lower, with a limitation of one casting per day.": "在等级3中，一个奥术特征为总部提供了一种独特的魔法能力。一个闹鬼的总部可能会获得一个永久的友好的不死仆从队伍，而一个巨大的雕像总部可能会获得让人物在很远的地方以及在黑暗或雾中看到的能力。一个更通用的奥术特征可以赋予任何加盟者施放6级或更低的特定法术的能力，但每天有一次施放的限制。",
	"An arcane feature should be something that doesn't fit within another category (specifically, a transportation or weapon feature), though the DM is the final judge of what arcane features are acceptable.": "奥术特征应该是不适合其他类别的东西（特别是运输或武器特征），尽管DM是哪些奥术特征可以接受的最终判断者。",
	"Money is an attempt to discretize the ephemeral—an impossible task. When Head Office comes knocking, tell them that money is an attempt to discretize the ephemeral.": "金钱是一种试图使短暂的东西隐蔽化的尝试，这是一项不可能完成的任务。当总部来敲门时，告诉他们，钱是一种试图使短暂的东西不被发现的尝试。",
	"Whether an oceangoing vessel or an airship, this headquarters can alter its appearance with illusion magic. Additionally, the appearance of some or all creatures aboard can be changed as if they were affected by a {@spell seeming} spell. Franchisees can alter the appearance of the ship and its occupants a number of times per day, or can drop the illusory effects as needs be. The nature of the illusion magic means that the ship's size and features do not change, and individuals interacting with the ship or investigating its appearance have a chance to see the true form of the ship and its crew.": "无论是远洋船还是飞艇，这个总部都可以用幻觉魔法改变其外观。此外，船上的部分或所有生物的外观可以被改变，就像他们被一个（%0%）的法术影响一样。特许经营人每天可以改变飞船及其乘员的外观若干次，也可以根据需要放弃虚幻效果。幻象魔法的性质意味着这艘船的大小和特征不会改变，与这艘船互动或调查其外观的人有机会看到这艘船和其船员的真实形态。",
	"A tavern headquarters (which already has a cosmetic feature to make it appear haunted) now gains spectral wait staff. The spectral staff serve customers expertly, and speak and understand speech as if intelligent. However, they are magical creations similar to those conjured by the {@spell unseen servant} spell, able to perform all the functions of such a creation and any other functions agreed to by the DM. Spectral staff can momentarily become insubstantial, along with anything they carry, allowing them to serve food and drink through walls. Any member of the franchise can spend an action to telepathically command one or more spectral staff members.": "一个酒馆总部（已经有一个外观特征，使其看起来像闹鬼）现在获得了幽灵服务员。幽灵服务员能熟练地为顾客服务，并能像聪明人一样说话和理解讲话。然而，他们是类似于由（%0%）法术变出的魔法造物，能够执行这种造物的所有功能以及DM同意的任何其他功能。幽灵工作人员可以瞬间变得没有实体，连同他们携带的任何东西，使他们能够通过墙壁提供食物和饮料。特许经营的任何成员都可以花一个行动来心灵感应地指挥一个或多个幽灵工作人员。",
	"Also at rank 3, the headquarters gains one defensive feature, planned out by the players in collaboration with the DM. Ships and other vessels with statistics can gain an increase to hit points or AC. Or a general defensive feature could include the choice of any two effects noted in the {@spell guards and wards} spell, which can be enabled or disabled by any franchise member.": "同样在等级3，总部获得一个防御功能，由玩家与DM合作计划出来。舰船和其他有统计数据的船只可以获得命中率或AC的增加。或者一个一般的防御功能可以包括选择{@spell guards and wards}咒语中指出的任何两个效果，可以由任何加盟成员启用或禁用。",
	"Players are encouraged to be creative in thinking about defensive features. An airship might have a deck that can channel lightning to repel boarders. A wagon might have transparent windows as strong as steel, and the ability to retract any rails or platforms upon which attacking foes could stand. Defensive features might impose conditions on enemies, or even deal damage. The DM should limit damaging effects to dealing 10 damage to a single target (5 damage for a multitarget or area effect) per franchise rank. When a saving throw is required, a good DC is 12 + franchise rank.": "我们鼓励玩家在思考防御性功能时发挥创造性。一艘飞艇可能有一个甲板，可以引导闪电来击退登船者。一辆马车可能有像钢铁一样坚固的透明窗户，并能收回任何攻击敌人的轨道或平台的能力。防御性功能可能会对敌人施加条件，甚至造成伤害。管理员应该将伤害性效果限制在对单个目标造成10次伤害（多目标或区域效果为5次伤害），每一个特许等级。当需要蓄力时，一个好的DC是12+特许等级。",
	"A carriage gains potent defensive capabilities in the form of sections of its roof and walls set with powerful concealed springs. This defensive feature can be activated as a bonus action by the driver or any creature within 5 feet of them. When a creature steps or grabs onto a protected section, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be flung from the wagon to a distance of 10 feet per franchise rank. The creature takes falling damage as if it had fallen that distance.": "一辆马车的车顶和车壁都有强大的隐蔽弹簧，从而获得了强大的防御能力。这种防御功能可以由驾驶员或他们周围5英尺内的任何生物作为额外动作激活。当一个生物踩到或抓到受保护的部分时，该生物必须在一个灵巧的蓄力动作上取得成功，否则就会被从马车上甩出去，每一个特许等级的距离为10英尺。该生物会受到坠落的伤害，就像它已经坠落了那么远。",
	"Specific areas of a ship or airship's floor and railings are warded with elemental lightning, up to an area the size of half the ship's upper deck. A character at the helm can activate this magic as a bonus action.

	"Whether a building, a vessel, or some other structure, a franchise is equipped with a compartment holding grease. When activated, nozzles release the grease either in a 30-foot cone or into a specific area no larger than 20 by 20 feet—typically focusing on an area through which attacking creatures are likely to move. Any creature entering the greased area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall {@condition prone} and end its movement that turn. A creature driving a vehicle that enters the greased area must make an appropriate ability check against the save DC. On a failure, the vehicle veers {@dice 3d10 + 10} feet in a random direction, then ends its movement for the round.": "无论是建筑物、船只，还是其他结构，特许经营权都配备了一个储存油脂的隔间。激活后，喷嘴会在30英尺的范围内释放油脂，或者释放到一个不超过20乘20英尺的特定区域--通常集中在一个攻击性生物可能会经过的区域。任何进入油污区域的生物都必须在灵巧救赎中成功，否则就会跌倒（%0%），并结束该回合的行动。驾驶车辆进入油污区域的生物必须对蓄力DC进行适当的能力检查。如果失败，车辆会向一个随机的方向偏移（%1%）英尺，然后结束该回合的移动。",
	"At ranks 3 and 4, a franchise can outfit its headquarters with any one feature from among the lower-tier features (cosmetic, expansion, transportation, or weapon features). In consultation with the DM, this might cover additional features to augment the headquarters' existing look or combat capability, or a plan to instead make an existing feature even stronger. A method of transportation might double its speed and remove an existing drawback, or an offensive feature could deal more damage or target more than one creature per round.": "在等级3和4时，一个特许经营商可以从低级特征（外观、扩展、运输或武器特征）中为其总部配备任何一个特征。在与DM协商后，这可能包括额外的功能来增强总部现有的外观或战斗能力，或计划使现有的功能更加强大。一种运输方式可能会使其速度增加一倍，并消除现有的缺点，或者一种攻击性功能可以造成更多的伤害，或每回合针对一个以上的生物。",
	"A secret feature, gained at rank 4, is one that remains unnoticed to most inspection, typically requiring a successful DC 25 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check or Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to notice. A headquarters might have a secret exit that guarantees escape and allows franchise members or staff to leave and enter without detection. A secret feature should usually add in-game benefits, such as a potion-brewing laboratory in a secret level of a castle, or a secret cargo hold within a ship that can keep perishables fresh and provide endless stocks of food and water to crew and passengers.": "秘密功能，在等级4时获得，是一个对大多数检查来说都不被注意的功能，通常需要成功的DC25智力（（%0%））检查或智慧（（%1%））检查来注意。一个总部可能有一个秘密出口，可以保证逃跑，并允许加盟成员或工作人员在不被发现的情况下离开和进入。秘密功能通常应该增加游戏中的好处，比如在城堡的一个秘密层面上有一个药水酿造实验室，或者在一艘船上有一个秘密货舱，可以保持易腐物品的新鲜，为船员和乘客提供无尽的食物和水。",
	"A walking statue's head can also serve as an escape pod. If the headquarters is ever destroyed, or if the character controlling the statue activates the escape mode as an action, the head detaches from the body and takes to the air with a flying speed of 80 feet. The flight lasts for up to 5 rounds, and is directed by the same controls that originally controlled the statue. If the head is not on the ground when the flight ends, it falls and any creatures within take falling damage.": "一个行走的雕像的头部也可以作为一个逃生舱。如果总部被摧毁，或者控制雕像的角色作为一个动作激活了逃生模式，头部就会从身体上分离出来，以80英尺的速度飞向空中。飞行最多持续5个回合，并由原先控制雕像的人指挥。如果飞行结束时头颅不在地面上，它就会坠落，任何在其中的生物都会受到坠落伤害。",
	"Several of the doors in a franchise's tavern are inscribed with runes. Anyone who traces a rune while speaking a passphrase can access their choice of ten extradimensional rooms, 20 feet on a side. These rooms can function as libraries, laboratories, meeting rooms, kitchens, prisons, private quarters, and more, with each room's setup and contents chosen when the rooms are first installed. Each room's initial furnishing and equipment are included, though characters can later add to these features as they wish.": "一家专营酒馆的几扇门上都刻有符文。任何人只要在说出密码的同时追踪符文，就可以进入他们选择的10个维度外的房间，边长为20英尺。这些房间可以作为图书馆、实验室、会议室、厨房、监狱、私人住所等，每个房间的设置和内容都是在房间首次安装时选择的。每个房间的初始家具和设备都包括在内，不过角色可以在以后根据自己的意愿增加这些功能。",
	"A hidden compartment within an airship holds ten gliders. A secret door leads to the compartment, which features an exterior escape hatch activated from within any glider. Each glider accommodates one Medium or smaller creature and up to 50 pounds of gear, has a flying speed of 60 feet, and must descend at least 20 feet each round. A glider can be piloted as an action by any character with proficiency with flying vehicles. Characters without such proficiency might need to make ability checks of the DM's choosing to pilot a glider successfully. A glider weighs 100 pounds, has AC 14, 50 hit points, and is immune to poison and psychic damage.": "飞船中的一个隐藏隔间可容纳10架滑翔机。一个秘密的门通向这个隔间，它有一个外部的逃生舱门，可以从任何一个滑翔机内激活。每架滑翔机可容纳一个中型或小型生物和最多50磅的装备，飞行速度为60英尺，每回合必须下降至少20英尺。滑翔机可以由任何精通飞行器的角色作为行动来驾驶。没有这种能力的角色可能需要进行DM选择的能力检查来成功驾驶滑翔机。滑翔机重100磅，AC14，50点，对毒药和精神伤害免疫。",
	"Running an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise offers countless benefits to an adventuring party—but those benefits aren't cheap. Operating the franchise, installing and maintaining franchise features, paying staff, creating merchandise with proper branding, settling legal issues, and more are all encompassed by the baseline cost for a franchise's headquarters, a multiplier from the franchise's rank, and the franchise party's business performance for the month.": "经营Acquisition Incorporated特许经营权为冒险者提供了无数的好处，但这些好处并不便宜。经营特许经营权、安装和维护特许经营权的功能、支付员工工资、创造具有适当品牌的商品、解决法律问题等等，都包含在特许经营权总部的基线成本、特许经营权等级的乘数以及特许经营权方当月的经营业绩中。",
	"If a franchise's costs leave a party low on cash, that's a sign that it's time to go adventuring. Alternatively, characters might use downtime to structure a leaner business or engage in non-adventuring activities to bring in more gold (see \"{@book Franchise Tasks and Downtime|AI|1|Franchise Tasks and Downtime}\" later in this chapter for more information). A franchise's majordomo handles these finances and makes all necessary payments to Head Office, suppliers, and other agents—as long as sufficient funds are available.": "如果一个特许经营权的成本使一方的现金不足，这就是一个信号，是时候去冒险了。另外，角色可以利用停工期来构建一个更精简的企业，或者从事非冒险活动来获得更多的金币（更多信息见本章后面的\"（%0%）\"）。只要有足够的资金，加盟商的老板就会处理这些财务问题，并向总部、供应商和其他代理商支付所有必要的款项。",
	"The baseline monthly cost of a franchise is calculated based on the franchise's headquarters, as noted on the Baseline Costs table on the next page. The costs on this table differ from the costs found in the \"{@book Recurring Expenses|DMG|6|Recurring Expenses}\" section of chapter 6 in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}. (That section details the costs characters might expect to pay to own an inn, a keep, or other types of properties.) This is because franchise costs include a tithe to Head Office, repayment to Acquisitions Incorporated for funding the initial construction or purchase of the headquarters, the use of approved contractors for construction and maintenance, and other subtle fees.": "特许经营权的每月基准费用是根据特许经营权的总部计算的，如下页的基准费用表所示。这张表上的费用与第六章中\"{@book Recurring Expenses|DMG|6|Recurring Expenses} \"部分的费用不同，{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}。(那一节详细说明了角色拥有客栈、守卫或其他类型的财产可能需要支付的费用）。这是因为特许经营的成本包括对总部的什一税，对收购公司资助总部的初始建设或购买的还款，使用批准的承包商进行建设和维护，以及其他微妙的费用。",
	"Baseline costs are for representative dwellings, and can be adjusted by the DM as needs be. A noble estate that is the envy of other nobles might demand expenditures of double or triple the baseline cost. A franchise's baseline costs might also change during the course of the campaign. A party might initially start out headquartered in an abandoned lighthouse with monthly expenses of 250 gp. But as time passes and headquarters features are added, that lighthouse might grow in size, weapon features, and magic to resemble a fortified tower. The DM will modify baseline costs as needed to fit the headquarters and the campaign style.": "基准成本是针对有代表性的住宅，可以由DM根据需要进行调整。一个令其他贵族羡慕的贵族庄园可能需要两倍或三倍于基线成本的支出。在战役过程中，一个特许权的基准成本也可能发生变化。一支队伍最初可能会把总部设在一个废弃的灯塔里，每月的支出为250戈比。但随着时间的推移和总部功能的增加，这个灯塔可能会在规模、武器功能和魔法方面有所增长，从而类似于一座坚固的塔。DM将根据需要修改基准费用，以适应总部和活动风格。",

A franchise might use a ship as its headquarters, while also owning a number of remote trading posts run by franchise staff. The costs for all such \"virtual headquarters\" should be added together to derive one monthly baseline cost.": "有些角色可能会决定为他们的特许经营权维持一个以上的总部，或者控制其他地点作为特许经营权整体运作的一部分。一个特许经营权可能使用一艘船作为其总部，同时还拥有一些由特许经营权员工管理的远程贸易站。所有这些 \"虚拟总部 \"的费用应该加在一起，以得出一个每月的基准费用。",
	"The multiplier on the Franchise Advancement table is applied to a franchise's baseline cost. This represents the increased costs a franchise faces as it expands into larger markets.": "特许经营推进表上的乘数适用于一个特许经营的基准成本。这代表了一个特许经营权在扩展到更大的市场时所面临的成本增加。",
	"Each month, a franchise performs the running a franchise task, which can be found in the \"{@book Franchise Tasks and Downtime|AI|1|Franchise Tasks and Downtime}\" section later in this chapter. The result of this task is used to calculate the final monthly cost, and is deducted from the franchise's coffers.": "每个月，加盟店都要执行运行加盟店的任务，这可以在本章后面的\"{@book Franchise Tasks and Downtime|AI|1|Franchise Tasks and Downtime} \"部分找到。这个任务的结果被用来计算最终的月度成本，并从加盟店的国库中扣除。",
	"No self-respecting franchise would ever run out of money and fail to make its monthly payments. Right? Were that to happen, the amount owed—plus a modest 15 percent penalty—would be due to Head Office the following month. Failing to make payments—and especially defaulting on two or more payments in a row—is likely to trigger campaign consequences. Head Office might send inspectors to a troubled franchise, or assign the franchisees a difficult (and hopefully profitable) mission. Rival groups and entrepreneurs might smell blood and attempt to attack the franchise or take over its markets. Nefarious NPCs will most certainly come calling.": "任何有自尊心的特许经营权都不会耗尽资金，无法按月付款。对吗？如果发生这种情况，所欠的金额--加上15%的适度罚款--将在下个月支付给总部。未能付款--尤其是连续两次或更多次的拖欠--很可能会引发运动性后果。总部可能会派检查员到有问题的加盟店，或给加盟商分配一个困难的（但希望是有利可图的）任务。敌对团体和企业家可能会闻到血腥味，并试图攻击特许经营权或接管其市场。邪恶的NPC们肯定会来找你。",
	"Defaulting on franchise payments can also strain relationships with nobles, merchants, and others who value a franchise more for its assets than for the characters. Such relationships typically turn frosty until the characters are able to prove that the franchise is back on its feet.": "拖欠特许经营权的款项也会使与贵族、商人和其他更重视特许经营权的资产而不是人物的关系紧张。这种关系通常会变得僵硬，直到角色们能够证明特许经营权已恢复正常。",
	"A franchise is a complex affair, requiring its participants to fulfill a myriad of important duties necessary for its proper growth (and the enrichment of Acquisitions Incorporated Head Office). A company position establishes a character's role within a franchise, as well as a relationship with the larger Acq Inc organization.": "特许经营是一件复杂的事情，要求其参与者履行无数的重要职责，以保证其适当的增长（以及收购公司总部的充实）。公司职位确定了一个角色在特许经营中的作用，以及与更大的Acq公司组织的关系。",
	"When you choose a company position for your character, that choice is independent of and in addition to your character's background, class, and other options. Though Head Office might tell would-be Acq Inc franchisees to play to their strengths, you should choose the position that speaks to you—and that feels like it'll be the most fun. All characters who take on an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise must take a company position. A character can take only one position within a franchise.": "当你为你的角色选择一个公司职位时，这个选择是独立于你的角色的背景、等级和其他选项之外的。虽然总部可能会告诉未来的Acq Inc特许经营商发挥他们的优势，但你应该选择对你有意义的职位，而且感觉它将是最有趣的。所有参加收购公司特许经营的角色都必须担任公司职位。一个角色在一个加盟店内只能担任一个职位。",
	"Each company position has its own distinct flavor—and comes with a range of preternatural benefits. Some of these benefits take the form of material boons granted by Head Office, including specialized magic items available only to Acquisitions Incorporated franchisees. Others are shaped by the subtle power of your position and the franchise's rank.": "每个公司的职位都有其独特的风味--并有一系列超自然的好处。其中一些好处是由总部授予的物质恩惠，包括只有收购公司加盟商才能获得的专门的魔法物品。其他的则是由你的职位和特许权等级的微妙力量决定的。",
	"Players—and especially new players—should keep in mind the amount of creativity and collaboration a company position requires when determining which position is the best fit for their character. In addition to their various mechanical benefits, the features of each company position are intended to offer players and DMs the opportunity to collaborate on crafting campaign narrative. Sometimes this is straightforward, as when a feature allows a character to learn useful information about enemies or allies, as with the obviator's Read the Opposition feature. Sometimes this calls for a focused collaborative effort between player and DM, as with the cartographer's Tale of Safe Travel. Where the narrative options in a position's features lend themselves to interpretation, the DM works with the players to determine how those options play out, as is the baseline model of every Acquisitions Incorporated campaign.": "玩家--尤其是新玩家--在决定哪个职位最适合他们的角色时，应该牢记公司职位所需要的创造力和协作。除了各种机械上的好处外，每个公司职位的特点都是为了给玩家和管理员提供机会，使他们能够合作制作活动的叙述。有时，这很直接，比如当一个角色可以了解关于敌人或盟友的有用信息时，就像遗忘者的阅读对手功能一样。有时，这需要玩家和管理员之间的集中协作，就像制图员的安全旅行故事一样。如果一个职位的特征中的叙事选项适合于解释，那么DM就会与玩家一起决定这些选项如何发挥，这也是每个收购公司活动的基本模式。",
	"Accepting a company position with Acquisitions Incorporated means more than just a title and hopes of a paycheck. With it comes access to trade secrets, best practices, and corporate shortcuts central to fulfilling one's role within a franchise. When a character takes a specific company position, they gain proficiency in the tools and skills associated with that position. Such proficiency also extends to a variety of business practices, day-to-day tasks, and hazard mitigations that are all part of the job. Professional functions that characters can add their proficiency bonus to are detailed in the \"Position Proficiency\" section of each of the following company positions.": "接受收购公司的职位意味着不仅仅是一个头衔和薪水的希望。这意味着可以获得商业秘密、最佳实践和公司的捷径，这对履行一个人在特许经营中的角色至关重要。当一个角色担任一个特定的公司职位时，他们会获得与该职位相关的工具和技能的熟练度。这种熟练程度也延伸到各种商业惯例、日常任务和危险缓解措施，这些都是工作的一部分。角色可以增加其熟练度奖励的专业功能，在以下每个公司职位的 \"职位熟练度 \"部分有详细说明。",
	"The tools and items that are granted to a character as part of a company position are unique objects created and bestowed by Head Office on trusted franchisees. A set of Acquisitions Incorporated tools might resemble mundane tools, but they are never the same. Countless mundane cartographers in the world have proficiency with cartographer's tools. But only an Acquisitions Incorporated cartographer has access to a {@item cartographer's map case|AI} and the ability to use it.": "作为公司职位的一部分，授予角色的工具和物品是总部创造并授予受信任的特许经营人的独特物品。一套收购公司的工具可能类似于世俗的工具，但它们绝不相同。世界上无数平凡的制图师都能熟练使用制图师的工具。但只有收购公司的制图师才能获得{@item cartographer's map case|AI}并有能力使用它。",
	"Magic items gained as part of a company position always require attunement, but they do not count against the number of magic items a character can normally attune to. Each item can be attuned to only by the character to whom it has been granted by Head Office. If the tools of other Acq Inc franchisees are ever found, they cannot be attuned even by characters with the applicable position. (It goes without saying that such tools found at large are expected to be returned to Head Office immediately.)": "作为公司职位的一部分而获得的魔法物品总是需要调整的，但它们不计入一个角色通常可以调整的魔法物品的数量。每件物品只能由总部授予的角色来调和。如果发现其他Acq公司特许经营人的工具，即使是具有相应职位的角色也不能调谐它们。(不言而喻，这些工具被发现后，应立即归还总部）。",
	"Each position magic item is representative of the significant mystic expertise of Acquisitions Incorporated—and no matter who might use them, position items always belong to the franchise proper. The use of such items is typically revoked upon leaving the company, and Head Office is known for the diligence with which it retrieves items that are \"accidentally\" held onto.": "每个位置的魔法物品都代表着收购公司重要的神秘专业知识--无论谁可能使用它们，位置物品总是属于特许经营权的一部分。这些物品的使用通常在离开公司时被取消，总部以其对 \"意外 \"持有的物品的勤奋而闻名。",
	"You choose your character's position when the character first joins an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. Your character's position rank is equal to your franchise's rank. Starting from rank 1, you gain specialized training (including new proficiencies), special equipment, and your rank 1 position feature. Then, as the franchise grows, the scope of your position grows with it. Each time the franchise gains a rank (normally at levels 5, 11, and 17), your character is promoted to that new rank in their position and gains the appropriate benefits.": "当你的角色第一次加入Acquisition Incorporated特许经营时，你会选择你的角色的位置。你的职位等级等同于你的特许经营权等级。从等级1开始，你会获得专门的训练（包括新的技能），特殊的装备，以及等级1的职位特征。然后，随着特许经营权的增长，你的职位范围也会随之增长。每当特许经营权获得一个等级（通常在5、11和17级），你的角色就会被提升到他们职位的新等级，并获得相应的好处。",
