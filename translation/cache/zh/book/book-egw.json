	"Imagination drives innovation and inspires communal creation. For this geeky theater kid, imagination was my solace.": "想象力推动了创新，激发了共同的创造。对于这个怪胎般的戏剧小子来说，想象力是我的慰藉。",
	"Since before my granny began reading me to sleep with {@i The Lord of the Rings} and Piers Anthony at the age of seven, I found myself simultaneously lost in, and empowered by, imagination. From playing make-believe with my brother in our rainy, Florida yard as children, to mowing through video game RPG after RPG, I found myself drawn into stories, especially those I could shape alongside my friends. It wasn't until I was introduced to {@i Dungeons & Dragons} during my freshman year of high school that I found an experience that entwined everything I loved about storytelling, collaboration, theater, and creativity. I began building worlds for my friends to play in and filling notebooks with strange ideas, quirky NPCs, and mediocre story threads (hey, everyone has to start somewhere). I had found my favorite pastime, one that continues to lift me up and shape who I am today.": "自从我的祖母在我七岁时开始给我读《%0%》和《皮尔斯-安东尼》入睡之前，我就发现自己同时迷失在想象力中，并被想象力赋予了力量。从小时候和哥哥在佛罗里达州下雨的院子里玩虚构的游戏，到后来在电子游戏的RPG中割草，我发现自己被故事所吸引，尤其是那些我可以和朋友一起塑造的故事。直到我在高一的时候被介绍给{@i Dungeons & Dragons}，我才发现这种体验将我喜欢的讲故事、合作、戏剧和创造力的一切都融合在一起。我开始为我的朋友们构建世界，并在笔记本上写下奇怪的想法、古怪的NPC和平庸的故事线索（嘿，每个人都得从某个地方开始）。我找到了我最喜欢的消遣方式，这个方式一直在提升我，塑造今天的我。",
	"All these years later, through a magical series of circumstances, a group of gaming friends and I began streaming our home game of D&D on the internet under the name {@i Critical Role}, expecting little to no interest after spending nearly a decade in web media being told anything longer than five minutes has little value to the \"ADHD generation.\" These myths were rapidly proven wrong, and our home game swelled into a community, then into an unanticipated phenomenon that has become something so deeply wonderful and important to me, and it seems, many others across the world.": "这些年之后，通过一系列神奇的情况，我和一群游戏朋友开始在互联网上以（%0%）的名义播放我们的家庭D&D游戏，在网络媒体上花了近十年的时间，被告知任何超过5分钟的东西对 \"多动症一代 \"来说都没有什么价值，我以为几乎没有兴趣。这些神话很快就被证明是错误的，我们的家庭游戏膨胀成了一个社区，然后变成了一个意想不到的现象，对我来说，似乎还有世界各地的许多人，都变得如此美妙和重要。",
	"It is through the original campaign following the exploits of the adventuring party Vox Machina, with myself helming the narrative as the Dungeon Master, that I began crafting the continent of Tal'Dorei and the world of Exandria for my friends to explore. Expanding this world with each heroic venture my friends took on, each unique facet of their characters' stories enriching this realm that otherwise existed entirely in my head, Exandria began to grow and mature, feeling at times like it was taking on a life of its own. By the end of that journey, as the heroes of Vox Machina completed their majestic tale, we all knew we had created something special. However, that was but the first of many tales we wanted to weave.": "正是通过最初的战役，在我作为地下城主掌舵的情况下，跟随冒险队伍Vox Machina的探索，我开始为我的朋友们制作Tal'Dorei大陆和Exandria的世界，供他们探索。随着我的朋友们进行的每一次英雄冒险，他们的角色故事的每一个独特方面都丰富了这个完全存在于我脑海中的领域，艾克桑德里亚开始成长和成熟，有时感觉它就像有了自己的生命。在这段旅程结束时，当《Vox Machina》的英雄们完成了他们宏伟的故事时，我们都知道我们创造了一些特别的东西。然而，这只是我们想要编织的许多故事中的第一个。",
	"A second campaign began shortly thereafter, this time taking place in the neighboring continent of Wildemount, a land bound by dark history, political struggle, and dangerous secrets simmering beneath the surface of everyday life. Now knowing the complexity my players were willing to engage with, I developed Wildemount on a scale and level of intricacy I had not previously attempted. I excitedly watched as this region of Exandria took shape, and it was here the Mighty Nein (as they came to be called) began their adventures, which they currently continue to the day of my writing this foreword. Wildemount expanded into a vast, complex, and delightful setting that I continued to grow more and more proud of. Then the incredible opportunity arose to collaborate with Wizards of the Coast to bring this setting to you in printed form.": "第二次战役很快就开始了，这次发生在邻近的荒野山庄大陆，那是一片被黑暗历史、政治斗争和日常生活表面下酝酿的危险秘密所束缚的土地。现在我知道了我的玩家愿意参与的复杂性，我以我以前从未尝试过的规模和复杂程度来开发荒野山庄。我兴奋地看着埃克桑德里亚的这一地区逐渐成形，\"强大的尼恩\"（他们后来被称为）就在这里开始了他们的冒险，直到我写这篇前言的那天，他们还在继续冒险。荒野山庄扩展为一个庞大、复杂和令人愉快的环境，我对它越来越感到自豪。然后，出现了一个令人难以置信的机会，那就是与海岸奇才合作，将这个设定以印刷的形式带给你。",
	"I have been nothing short of humbled and ecstatic at this chance to be a part of something so important to me. It has been a profound honor to bring our world into the D&D multiverse and invite you to come play and create in it. Exandria continues to be one of my proudest achievements, with Wildemount my most accomplished aspect of this world to date. This continent is ripe with adventure and mystery. To work with such talented people to make this campaign a reality is a joy I never thought I'd get to experience. Wildemount began with {@i Critical Role}, but this book is an invitation for you and your friends to make this world your own.": "对于有机会成为对我来说如此重要的一部分，我感到无比的谦卑和欣喜。能够将我们的世界带入D&D的多元宇宙，并邀请您在其中进行游戏和创作，这是一种莫大的荣幸。埃克桑德里亚仍然是我最自豪的成就之一，而荒野山庄则是我迄今为止在这个世界上最有成就的地方。这片大陆充满了冒险和神秘感。与如此有才华的人合作，使这项活动成为现实，这是我从未想过的快乐体验。野蛮生长始于{@i Critical Role}，但这本书是对您和您的朋友的邀请，使这个世界成为您自己的世界。",
	"I invite you all to come to Wildemount. Wander the dangerous valleys of Western Wynandir, sail up and down the Menagerie Coast, brave the wastes of Xhorhas's scarred lands, and explore the ancient secrets in the regions beyond these war-embroiled realms. Follow the paths of the Mighty Nein or blaze your own trail. This is your Wildemount now.": "我邀请你们都来野人山庄。徜徉在威南迪尔西部危险的山谷中，在玛纳吉海岸上下航行，勇敢地在肖哈斯伤痕累累的荒原上前进，并探索这些被战争包围的王国之外地区的古老秘密。沿着伟大的尼恩的道路前进，或者开辟你自己的道路。这就是你的荒野山庄了。",
	"Two armies clash on a fog-shrouded battlefield, heralded by the sound of trumpets and drums on one side, and by an eerie, chirping whistle like countless thousands of wailing crickets on the other. A raven, its ebon feathers spattered with blood, alights on one of the fallen corpses and gently raps its beak on the soldier's helmet. The raven looks up, curious, and flies into the sky. A land embroiled in war expands beneath it, and yet, within the shroud of conflict, the raven sees twinkling pockets of light.": "两支军队在浓雾笼罩的战场上发生冲突，一方有号角声和鼓声，另一方有阴森恐怖的鸣笛声，像无数只哀鸣的蟋蟀。一只乌鸦，其乌黑的羽毛上溅满了鲜血，落在一具倒下的尸体上，用嘴轻轻地拍打着士兵的头盔。乌鸦好奇地抬头看了看，然后飞向天空。一片陷入战争的土地在它脚下扩张，然而，在冲突的笼罩下，乌鸦看到了闪烁的光点。",
	"The raven sees souls that shine bright with courage, kindness, and determination. It sees souls lustrous with greed, fear, and anger. And most of all, it sees souls radiating with a desire to discover their place in the world. The raven sees Wildemount.": "乌鸦看到的是闪耀着勇气、仁慈和决心的灵魂。它看到灵魂因贪婪、恐惧和愤怒而熠熠生辉。而最重要的是，它看到了散发着渴望发现自己在这个世界上的位置的灵魂。乌鸦看到了怀尔德蒙。",
	"Wildemount is a new setting for your Dungeons & Dragons campaign, originally created by Matthew Mercer as the setting for the second campaign of the hit series Critical Role. Though it's just one continent in the larger world of Exandria, Wildemount is teeming with varied cultures, locales, peoples, and monsters. It is home to both avatars of evil and paragons of good, but it is defined by the common people who exist in between these two ideals.": "Wildemount是龙与地下城活动的一个新设定，最初由Matthew Mercer创造，作为热门系列《关键角色》的第二个活动的设定。虽然它只是艾克桑德里亚这个大世界中的一块大陆，但荒野山庄却充满了各种文化、地点、民族和怪物。这里既有邪恶的化身，也有善良的典范，但它是由存在于这两种理想之间的普通人所定义。",
	"This book is for D&D players and Dungeon Masters of all experience levels. It is for newcomers and for hardcore fans of Critical Role alike. If you've watched every episode of Critical Role to date, this book will still contain surprises for you, as there are corners of Wildemount that even the Mighty Nein weren't able to explore in their adventures.": "本书是为所有经验水平的D&D玩家和地下城主准备的。它既适合新人，也适合《关键角色》的铁杆粉丝。如果你已经看了《关键角色》迄今为止的每一集，这本书仍然会给你带来惊喜，因为荒野山庄的一些角落，即使是强大的尼恩在他们的冒险中也没能探索到。",
	"If you're a Dungeon Master, this book will help you create a D&D campaign set in a land of war, intrigue, and swashbuckling adventure. You could set your campaign entirely within one of Wildemount's four regions, or you could follow the example set by Critical Role and create a campaign with a constantly evolving tone as the adventurers journey across the continent. You will also find brand-new monsters and introductory adventures that can help you start a campaign in any of Wildemount's four regions.": "如果你是一名地下城主，这本书将帮助你创建一个以战争、阴谋和冒险为背景的D&D活动。你可以将你的战役完全设置在荒野山庄的四个地区之一，或者你可以效仿《关键角色》的例子，在冒险者穿越大陆的过程中创建一个基调不断变化的战役。你还会发现全新的怪物和介绍性的冒险，可以帮助你在荒野山庄的任何一个地区开始一个活动。",
	"If you're a player, this book contains new options that will help your character fit in perfectly with this strange new land. You can use the heroic chronicle system to create a backstory that firmly roots your character in the lands of Wildemount. You'll also find new subclasses as well as new magic items that will help you attain greater and greater power as you travel the continent.": "如果你是一名玩家，本书包含的新选项将帮助你的角色完美地融入这片陌生的新土地。你可以使用英雄编年史系统来创建一个背景故事，使你的角色牢牢扎根于荒野山庄的土地上。你还会发现新的子类以及新的魔法物品，它们将帮助你在穿越大陆时获得越来越大的力量。",
	"Wildemount's various regions are described in greater detail in {@book chapter 3|EGW|4}. Here's a quick overview of the major civilizations of Wildemount.": "Wildemount的各个地区在{@book chapter 3|EGW|4}中都有更详细的描述。下面是野人山主要文明的简要介绍。",
	"The raven soars over a massive city, sprawling outward from a somber, monolithic palace. Soldiers and war machines pour from the city, stretching across the land like innumerable grasping arms, greedily encircling the continent. The raven notes this hungry behemoth and alters course.": "乌鸦在一座巨大的城市上空翱翔，从一座阴沉的巨石宫殿向外延伸。士兵和战争机器从城市中涌出，像无数的抓手一样延伸到土地上，贪婪地包围着大陆。乌鸦注意到这个饥饿的庞然大物，改变了方向。",
	"The Dwendalian Empire is a young, ambitious state borne from decades of strife in Western Wynandir—the heartland of Wildemount. Its austere lands are dotted with tiny villages, ruins of ancient civilizations, and pockets of uncharted wilderness.": "德文达尔帝国是一个年轻的、雄心勃勃的国家，它诞生于威南迪尔西部几十年的纷争之中--怀尔德蒙的中心地带。它朴素的土地上点缀着小村庄、古代文明的遗迹和小块未知的荒野。",
	"Campaigns set in the Dwendalian Empire are bound to involve elements of war and political intrigue. The empire is at war with the Kryn Dynasty, a nation of surface-dwelling drow which occupies Eastern Wynandir and the wastes of Xhorhas. This war allows various Dwendalian factions, such as the power-hungry Cerberus Assembly, to vie for political dominance.": "在德温达里亚帝国进行的战役必然会涉及战争和政治阴谋的元素。帝国正与克里恩王朝交战，克里恩王朝是一个由地表居住的乌鸦组成的国家，占据着东威南迪尔和Xhorhas的荒地。这场战争使德文达尔人的各个派别，如渴望权力的地狱犬议会，争夺政治统治权。",
	"Westward flies the herald of the Raven Queen. It bursts through the clouds above the western mountains and emerges into a land blessed by sun. A sea of lush jungle stretches out beneath the raven, until eventually green gives way to golden sand, and then to a boundless, sapphire sea. Ships swarm on that sea like a cloud of gnats, engulfed by flames and the sound of cannon fire. They fight for freedom.": "乌鸦女王的预示向西飞去。它冲破了西部山脉上方的云层，出现在一片被太阳祝福的土地上。一片郁郁葱葱的丛林在乌鸦身下延伸，直到最后绿色让位给金色的沙子，然后是一望无际的蓝宝石海。船只在海面上蜂拥而至，就像一团蚊子，被火焰和炮声所吞没。他们为自由而战。",
	"The Clovis Concord is a republic of city-states lining the Menagerie Coast, the westernmost shore of Wildemount. This tropical region is rich with history and known for a lively, free-spirited culture that contrasts sharply with Wildemount's other, politically narrow-minded nations.": "克洛维斯康科德是一个由城邦组成的共和国，沿Menagerie海岸而建，是Wildemount的最西端海岸。这个热带地区历史悠久，以活泼、自由的文化而闻名，与怀尔德蒙其他政治上狭隘的国家形成鲜明的对比。",
	"Campaigns set on the Menagerie Coast are often nautical, exploring the conflict between the law of the Clovis Concord and the chaos of the Revelry pirates. They can also investigate the jungles that line the coast and the ancient ruins hidden within their verdant boughs.": "以Menagerie海岸为背景的战役通常是航海性的，探索Clovis Concord的法律和Revelry海盗的混乱之间的冲突。他们还可以调查海岸线上的丛林和隐藏在其青翠枝叶中的古代遗迹。",
	"The raven, battered by ice and snow, sees petty warlords lead bands of slavers across the snowfields and understands that no law but power rules the north. It sees smugglers and thieves flee beyond the grasp of civilization and into the unknown. It sees the vast, roiling wilderness act with a fell will of its own, claiming the lives of those who dare attempt to grasp power beyond their ken. They fight for survival, glory, and greed.": "被冰雪打击的乌鸦看到小军阀带领着奴隶主队伍穿越雪原，明白除了权力，没有任何法律可以统治北方。它看到走私者和盗贼逃出了文明的范围，进入了未知的世界。它看到巨大的、咆哮的荒野以其自身的意志行事，夺取那些敢于尝试掌握超越其能力的人的生命。他们为生存、荣誉和贪婪而战。",
	"The Tribes of Shadycreek Run are a fragmented coalition of thieves, slavers, and scoundrels who managed to amass power in the frigid backwater of Shadycreek Run. While they struggle to enrich themselves through crime, however, they fail to realize that malign, primordial powers are creeping into the north underneath their noses.": "沙迪克流部落是一个由盗贼、奴隶主和恶棍组成的零散联盟，他们设法在沙迪克流这个寒冷的落后地区积累了权力。然而，当他们努力通过犯罪来充实自己的时候，他们没有意识到邪恶的、原始的力量正在他们的眼皮底下悄悄地进入北方。",
	"Campaigns set in the Biting North often involve morally gray characters butting heads with equally amoral organizations in a struggle to survive—and then explode into chaos as forces beyond mortal imagination make all these petty conflicts seem insignificant by comparison.": "设置在北方的战役往往涉及到道德上的灰色人物与同样不道德的组织在生存斗争中发生冲突，然后爆发出混乱，因为超出凡人想象的力量使所有这些琐碎的冲突相比之下显得微不足道。",
	"Finally, the raven flies east. It sees beings that would be slain on sight in the other civilized nations of Wildemount, walking side-by-side with humans and gray-skinned elves. The raven sees that these people have a light within them—and it sees that, far to the east, there is a mighty fortress that contains a light unseen since the dawning of the world. Here, they fight for the revelation of the end of the world.": "最后，乌鸦向东飞去。它看到那些在野人山其他文明国家会被当场杀死的生命，与人类和灰皮肤的精灵并肩而行。乌鸦看到，这些人体内有一种光，而且它看到，在遥远的东方，有一个强大的堡垒，其中有一种自世界黎明以来从未见过的光。在这里，他们为世界末日的启示而战斗。",
	"The Kryn Dynasty is an empire made up of dark elves (drow) and other humanoids typically considered to be monsters by the other nations of Wildemount, such as minotaurs, goblinkin, and gnolls. The Kryn Dynasty rules over the wastes of Xhorhas, a land once blighted by the rule of the Betrayer Gods when immortals still walked the land. The Kryn safeguard a secret; if your players haven't seen any of Critical Role, revealing this secret could mark the turning point of a campaign.": "克林王朝是一个由黑暗精灵（drow）和其他被荒野之城其他国家视为怪物的人形生物组成的帝国，例如牛头人、哥布林金和地精。克林王朝统治着Xhorhas的荒原，这片土地曾经被背叛者之神的统治所玷污，当时不朽的人还在这片土地上行走。克林人守护着一个秘密；如果你的玩家没有见过任何《关键角色》，揭示这个秘密可能会成为战役的转折点。",
	"A campaign set in Xhorhas will doubtless involve the war between the Kryn Dynasty and the Dwendalian Empire, but it can also include traditional dungeon crawls, political intrigue within the courts of the dynasty, or even wilderness exploration that could unearth secrets lost since the fall of the Betrayer Gods.": "以Xhorhas为背景的战役无疑会涉及克莱恩王朝和德文达尔帝国之间的战争，但它也可以包括传统的地牢爬行、王朝宫廷内的政治阴谋，甚至是可能发掘自背叛者之神陨落以来失去的秘密的野外探索。",
	"{@book Chapter 1|EGW|2} of this book introduces the big ideas you'll need to know before creating a campaign in Wildemount: its history and its gods.": "{@book Chapter 1|EGW|2}本书介绍了你在创建荒野山庄战役前需要知道的大概念：它的历史和它的神灵。",
	"{@book Chapter 2|EGW|3} presents the major political players that shape daily life in Wildemount: its factions and societies. Depending on the choices made by your party of adventurers, these organizations might become their allies or their enemies. Some characters might begin play with a history of involvement with one of these factions, and several backgrounds are included later on to represent this allegiance.": "{@book Chapter 2|EGW|3}介绍了影响荒野山庄日常生活的主要政治角色：它的派别和社会。根据你的冒险者队伍的选择，这些组织可能成为他们的盟友或敌人。一些角色在开始游戏时可能与这些派别中的某一派别有牵连，后面会有几个背景来代表这种效忠关系。",
	"{@book Chapter 3|EGW|4} contains the Wildemount gazetteer, which details the cities and points of interest in each of the continent's regions. The gazetteer includes NPCs, background information, and even plot hooks that you can use as the seeds of your own adventures. It also gives a brief overview of the other lands of Exandria beyond Wildemount.": "{@book Chapter 3|EGW|4}包含《荒野山庄》地名册，其中详细介绍了大陆每个地区的城市和景点。地名录包括NPC、背景信息，甚至还有情节钩子，你可以将其作为你自己冒险的种子。它还简要介绍了野人山以外的艾克珊德里亚的其他土地。",
	"{@book Chapter 4|EGW|5} is for players first and foremost; combined with the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, it contains everything you need to create a character for a Wildemount campaign.": "{@book Chapter 4|EGW|5}首先是为玩家准备的；结合{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}，它包含了你为荒野山庄活动创造一个角色所需要的一切。",
	"The final chapters of this book, {@book chapters 5|EGW|6} through {@book 7|EGW|8}, give DMs starting adventures they can use to kick off their campaigns as well as new magic items and monsters to include in adventures of their own design.": "本书的最后几章，从{@book chapters 5|EGW|6}到{@book 7|EGW|8}，为管理员提供了可以用来启动他们活动的起始冒险，以及可以在他们自己设计的冒险中包含的新魔法物品和怪物。",
	"The continent of Wildemount is a powder keg about to explode. Tensions between the Dwendalian Empire and the Kryn Dynasty have just erupted into open war, and everyone in Wildemount, including the adventurers, must contend with the fallout of the conflict between the continent's two imperial superpowers.": "怀尔德蒙大陆是一个即将爆炸的火药桶。德文达尔帝国和克里恩王朝之间的紧张关系刚刚爆发为公开的战争，怀尔德蒙的每个人，包括冒险者，都必须应对大陆上两个帝国超级大国之间的冲突所带来的影响。",
	"The war is only as important as you make it. If you place either the battles of the war or their consequences front and center, the war will be of chief concern to your players. If you keep the war and its consequences distant, then the characters will be free to interact with or ignore the war as they see fit. With a little bit of creative tweaking of the setting, you could create a Wildemount campaign where the war has been called off or never even happened!": "战争的重要性只取决于你的决定。如果你把战争的战斗或其后果放在前面和中心位置，那么战争就会成为玩家的主要关切。如果你把战争和它的后果放在遥远的地方，那么角色们就可以自由地与战争互动或忽略它，因为他们认为合适。只要对设定进行一点创造性的调整，你就可以创造出一个野人山庄的战役，在那里，战争已经被取消了，或者甚至从来没有发生过！这就是野人山庄。",
	"If you want the war to be an important part of your campaign, you need to give your players a reason for their characters to care about it. The easiest way to get buy-in from your players is to discuss out-of-character how big of a factor they want war to be in this campaign. You can even dial the importance of the war up and down over the course of the campaign, depending on how you and your players feel over time.": "如果你想让战争成为战役的重要组成部分，你需要给你的玩家一个让他们的角色关心战争的理由。获得玩家支持的最简单的方法是，在角色之外讨论他们希望战争在这场战役中成为多大的因素。你甚至可以在活动过程中，根据你和你的玩家的感受，调高或调低战争的重要性。",
	"If you and your players find war to be dramatic and compelling, urge your players to create characters with strong ties to the conflict. For example, patriotic (or even jingoistic) characters will always fight for king or queen and country. Likewise, greedy characters will fight for profit and glory. Once they've given you their reasons, turn those motivations into plot points in your campaign.": "如果你和你的玩家认为战争具有戏剧性和吸引力，那么就敦促你的玩家创造与冲突有密切联系的角色。例如，爱国主义（甚至是金戈铁马）的角色总是为国王或女王和国家而战。同样，贪婪的角色会为了利益和荣耀而战。一旦他们给了你他们的理由，就把这些动机变成你活动中的情节点。",
	"The adventurers don't have to be active combatants for the war to affect their lives. See below for a list of adventure options that touch on the consequences of war without directly involving mass warfare.": "冒险者不一定要成为积极的战斗人员，战争才会影响他们的生活。请看下面涉及战争后果而又不直接涉及大规模战争的冒险选项清单。",
	"If you want the war to be completely absent, simply dial the timeline back by a year, or even just a few months. All the political tensions between the Dwendalian Empire and the Kryn Dynasty still exist, but now they're just simmering instead of at a full boil.": "如果你想让战争完全消失，只需将时间线往后拨一年，甚至只是几个月。德文达尔帝国和克莱恩王朝之间的所有政治紧张关系仍然存在，但现在它们只是在酝酿，而不是完全沸腾。",
	"Not all campaigns set in Wildemount need to deal with the war directly. That is, the characters aren't expected to conscript with one army or another, or even serve as mercenaries. The effects of war are far-reaching and multifarious, and loose-cannon adventurers are the perfect people to get involved in the countless conflicts sparked by war. These schemes could include:": "并非所有在荒野山庄的活动都需要直接处理战争。也就是说，人物不需要征召到某支军队，甚至不需要充当雇佣兵。战争的影响是深远而多变的，而松散的冒险者是参与战争引发的无数冲突的最佳人选。这些计划可能包括",
	"In times of war, criminals and smugglers take advantage of lax law enforcement. Petty criminals and crime syndicates like the Myriad will need help moving illicit goods in and out of Dwendalian and Xhorhasian cities, and Revelry pirates will need loyal crew members to raid unprotected towns.": "在战争时期，犯罪分子和走私者会利用执法不严的情况。像迈瑞德（Myriad）这样的小罪犯和犯罪集团将需要帮助将非法货物运入和运出德文达尔（Dwendalian）和霍哈斯（Xhorhasian）的城市，而瑞弗里（Revelry）海盗将需要忠诚的船员来袭击没有保护的城镇。",
	"When a town is destroyed by advancing armies, or by a landslide caused by artillery, the common folk need help escaping. This could involve escorting noncombatants through no-man's-land to a nearby town, or carving out a new settlement from the wilds.": "当一个城镇被前进的军队摧毁，或者被大炮造成的山体滑坡摧毁时，老百姓需要帮助他们逃跑。这可能涉及到护送非战斗人员穿过无人区到附近的城镇，或从荒野中开辟一个新的定居点。",
	"When officers of the law are conscripted as soldiers, local lawmasters suddenly find themselves in need of mercenary aid. Lawful characters might find great adventure in flushing criminals out of cities and busting their wilderness hideaways.": "当法律官员被征召为士兵时，当地的执法者突然发现他们需要雇佣兵的帮助。合法的角色可能会在将罪犯赶出城市和捣毁他们的野外藏身处时发现巨大的冒险。",
	"Obviously, characters can choose to join up with one of the sides in this conflict to embark on missions and take orders from a commanding officer. This is a good option if you want to run an episodic campaign, where most game sessions begin with a stated mission that the players must accomplish and ends with a reward and another mission.": "很明显，角色可以选择加入这场冲突中的某一方，开始执行任务并接受指挥官的命令。如果你想开展一个情节性的战役，这是一个很好的选择，大多数游戏环节以玩家必须完成的既定任务开始，以奖励和另一个任务结束。",
	"The explosions of artillery and the pounding of boots against the plains can spook monsters, and invasions can cause even powerful monsters such as giants and dragons to flee their lairs. Whenever an upheaval occurs, soldiers and commoners alike find their lives in danger—and only adventurers can deal with the threat.": "大炮的爆炸声和靴子对平原的敲击声会惊动怪物，而入侵甚至会导致强大的怪物如巨人和龙逃离它们的巢穴。每当动乱发生时，士兵和平民都会发现他们的生命处于危险之中--只有冒险家才能应对这种威胁。",
	"Like the crime syndicates, opportunistic traders know that war is a chance to become rich. Adventurers are the perfect pawns for trade barons looking to sell high-value goods, especially if they have to cross dangerous land to reach their buyers.": "像犯罪集团一样，投机取巧的商人知道战争是发财的机会。冒险家是希望出售高价值货物的贸易大亨们的完美棋子，尤其是当他们不得不穿越危险的土地来接触他们的买家时。",
	"If there's one thing D&D adventurers hate, it's being told what to do, but serving in an army is all about following orders. It's up to the Dungeon Master to make sure the characters are aware of what they're getting into if they decide to enlist. Similarly, if you force your players to join a military unit and then discover that the characters actually want to go on self-directed adventures without a commanding officer ordering them around, you and your players should talk out-of-game to figure out a way to turn the campaign around.": "如果说D&D的冒险者有什么讨厌的事情，那就是被告知该做什么，但是在军队中服役就是要服从命令。地下城管理员应该确保角色在决定参军时知道他们要做什么。同样，如果你强迫你的玩家加入一个军事单位，然后发现这些角色实际上想在没有指挥官命令的情况下进行自主冒险，那么你和你的玩家应该在游戏外进行讨论，以找出扭转战役的方法。",
	"Since D&D is primarily a game about a small group of characters going on adventures alone, it can be difficult to simulate massive battles using D&D combat rules. Because of this, it's generally best to keep the characters away from mass battles. However, huge conflicts with thousands of combatants are a cornerstone of epic fantasy, and your players might be disappointed if your war campaign doesn't have at least one climactic battle.": "由于D&D主要是一个关于一小群角色单独冒险的游戏，因此使用D&D的战斗规则来模拟大规模的战斗是很困难的。正因为如此，一般来说，最好让角色远离大规模战斗。然而，拥有数千名战斗人员的巨大冲突是史诗般的幻想的基石，如果你的战争活动没有至少一场高潮迭起的战斗，你的玩家可能会感到失望。",
	"To solve this problem, you can break down your mass combat into manageable chunks. Find a significant location that the characters can either defend or conquer with minimal reinforcements, like an overrun citadel. Then, have the major battle proceed in waves that guide the characters from one cinematic encounter to another. You can think of these encounters like rooms in a dungeon; some rooms have multiple doors that the characters can choose from, while others only have a single passage.": "为了解决这个问题，你可以把你的大规模战斗分解成可管理的小块。找到一个重要的地点，让角色可以用最少的援军来保卫或征服它，比如一个被占领的城堡。然后，让主要的战斗一波接一波地进行，引导人物从一个电影式的遭遇战到另一个。你可以把这些遭遇想成是地牢里的房间；有些房间有多个门，人物可以选择，而其他房间只有一个通道。",
	"For example, after capturing the ruined fortress, the characters learn that a garrison of soldiers has arrived to help hold onto the fort, and the characters are needed elsewhere on the battlefield. You could present them with just a single urgent target, such as an enemy warlord, or you could offer them options, such as three different allied battalions under attack.": "例如，在占领了废墟要塞后，角色们得知有一支驻军赶来帮助坚守要塞，而战场上的其他地方也需要角色们。你可以只向他们提出一个紧急目标，比如一个敌军军阀，也可以为他们提供选择，比如三个不同的盟军营受到攻击。",
	"If you need to depict a lot of both allied and hostile NPCs battling in the same encounter as the players, you can simplify the encounter by ignoring dice rolls entirely and deciding when a creature dies based on your own instinct. This can work once in a while, but try to avoid doing this all the time, since seeing you simply decide the result of combat without dice can damage the believability of your game world.": "如果你需要描写大量的盟友和敌对的NPC与玩家在同一个遭遇战中作战，你可以通过完全忽略骰子的滚动来简化遭遇战，根据你自己的直觉来决定一个生物何时死亡。这种做法偶尔会奏效，但要尽量避免一直这样做，因为看到你在没有骰子的情况下简单地决定战斗的结果会损害你的游戏世界的可信度。",
	"This book is set in a certain moment in the history of Wildemount, and thus setting a campaign in a different era—or even in a different decade—could make some information in the gazetteer invalid.

	"From a real-world perspective, this book is set at a certain point during the adventures of the Mighty Nein in {@i Critical Role}'s second campaign. Thus, the point at which the adventures you create using this book diverge from canon is at episode 50 of campaign 2. That's okay!

	"Keeping track of time using the Exandrian calendar can make your game world seem more realistic. It can also allow you to align game sessions with important in-game dates, such as holidays.

	"Exandria has two known moons that orbit the planet. Catha, the larger and closer of the moons, is the herald of night travel and shines a bright white when visible in the sky. Catha is considered to be intrinsically tied to Sehanine, the Moon Weaver, and is regarded by some as a creation of the Moon Weaver to watch over the just and hide those who require obfuscation. Ruidus, the second moon of Exandria, is much smaller and farther away. With a slower rotation around the world and dark red-brown coloring, Ruidus is often difficult to see among the stars of the night sky and nearly impossible to spot during the day. Little is known of Ruidis, though older cultures and texts speak of it as an omen of ill tidings, or even a remnant of a Betrayer God plot left abandoned and unrealized.": "埃克桑德里亚有两颗已知的卫星，围绕着这个星球运行。Catha是其中较大和较近的一颗卫星，是夜间旅行的预兆，在天空中闪耀着明亮的白色。Catha被认为与织月者Sehanine有着内在的联系，并被一些人认为是织月者的创造物，用于监视正义者并隐藏那些需要混淆视听的人。雷杜斯（Ruidus）是艾克桑德里亚的第二颗卫星，要小得多，也远得多。围绕世界的旋转速度较慢，颜色为深红褐色，Ruidus在夜空的星星中往往很难看到，在白天几乎不可能发现。人们对Ruidis知之甚少，尽管古老的文化和文本将它说成是不祥的预兆，甚至是被遗弃的、未实现的背叛者上帝阴谋的残余。",

	"Life ever seeks to understand its inception. Every civilization has its own interpretation of where its story began. Even within the world of Exandria, different cultures have creation myths that eventually converge with recorded history, but there is no universally accepted story. Even so, the ancient city of Vasselheim on the distant continent of Othanzia is largely considered to be the oldest surviving city, having endured a terrible war that wiped out most of civilization nearly a thousand years ago. Vasselheim houses the earliest known temples to the gods, as well as the earliest known records of history that survived this catastrophic war.": "生命一直在寻求了解它的起源。每个文明都对自己的故事开始的地方有自己的解释。即使在埃克桑德里亚的世界里，不同的文化都有创世神话，并最终与有记载的历史相融合，但没有一个普遍接受的故事。即便如此，遥远的奥坦西亚大陆上的瓦瑟海姆古城在很大程度上被认为是现存最古老的城市，它经历了一场可怕的战争，在近千年前消灭了大部分的文明。瓦瑟海姆拥有已知最早的神庙，以及在这场灾难性战争中幸存的最早的历史记录。",

	"Long ago, this world was one of tumultuous and chaotic forces, naught but unbridled fires and churning, jagged rock. Through the ashen skies of Creation Primordial, the gods came from beyond the ether, new and formless. Looking on this roiling realm, they saw potential for great beauty, great strength, and the chance to learn their own place in creation.": "很久以前，这个世界是一个动荡和混乱的力量，除了肆意的火焰和汹涌的锯齿状岩石，什么都没有。穿过原始创造的灰暗天空，众神从乙醚之外来到这里，新的和无形的。观察着这个沸腾的领域，他们看到了巨大的美丽和强大的潜力，并有机会了解自己在创造中的地位。",
	"Thus, divine hands birthed the First Children, the elves, who embodied beauty and grace, to walk the verdant Green and know the music of the Blue. A second creation was wrought: the dwarves, a hearty people intent on taming the land, filled with the craft and invention of the divinity beyond the ashen void. A third people were given life: the humans, endowed with hearts of passion that burned as brightly as their spans of life were short, and infused with the need to celebrate and laugh.": "因此，神圣的双手孕育了第一批孩子，即精灵，他们体现了美丽和优雅，行走在青翠的绿色中，了解蓝色的音乐。第二个创造是：矮人，一个打算驯服土地的健壮民族，充满了灰暗虚空之外的神性的工艺和发明。第三个民族被赋予了生命：人类，被赋予了热情的心，他们的生命燃烧得很旺盛，而他们的寿命却很短，并且被注入了庆祝和欢笑的需要。",
	"Other creations followed as the many races of Exandria were given form from the boundless inspiration the of the protean gods. These Children of Creation walked the land and, as their knowledge grew, attempted to build on it. But the land was fierce and treacherous, and the children were dashed on the rocks and consumed by the elements. Sorrow filled the hearts of the gods as these first races struggled against a land that did not want them, and the children looked to their creators for guidance and protection. Thus, the gods gave to them gifts, lending their own power to their children to create and shape the world around them; these were the first divine magics.": "随着埃克桑德里亚的众多种族从保护神的无尽灵感中被赋予形式，其他的创造也随之而来。这些创造之子在这片土地上行走，随着他们知识的增长，试图在这片土地上进行建设。但这块土地凶猛而诡谲，孩子们被砸在岩石上，被元素所吞噬。诸神的心中充满了悲伤，因为这些最初的种族正在与一片不需要他们的土地斗争，孩子们期待着他们的创造者的指导和保护。因此，诸神给了他们礼物，把自己的力量借给他们的孩子，以创造和塑造他们周围的世界；这些是最早的神术。",
	"With these magics, the various peoples learned to bend the angry earth to their will: to temper the flames that burst through the ground, to tame the floods that threatened their abundance, and to turn seedling into fruit and beast into meal. Language became commonplace, culture was born, and governance replaced anarchy. The protean creators, the divinity beyond the ashen skies, saw progress and saw that it was good, yet fragile and in need of guardians.": "有了这些魔法，各族人民学会了让愤怒的大地屈服于他们的意志：缓和冲破地面的火焰，驯服威胁他们丰收的洪水，并把幼苗变成果实，把野兽变成食物。语言变得普遍，文化诞生了，治理取代了无政府状态。保护性的创造者，灰暗天空之外的神性，看到了进步，看到了它是好的，但也是脆弱的，需要守护者。",
	"Thus were born the First Protectors: the Dragons Metallic of Exandria, who safeguarded the gentler races. The realm grew quieter, the people multiplied, and new beings were given form and life. As culture grew, and the people further understood the world around them, they also looked up to their creators and gave them worship, gave them form, gave them title and purpose.": "因此，第一批保护者诞生了：Exandria的龙族金属人，他们保护着温和的种族。这个王国越来越安静，人们越来越多，新的生物被赋予了形式和生命。随着文化的发展，人们进一步了解他们周围的世界，他们也仰望着他们的创造者，给他们以崇拜，给他们以形式，给他们以称号和目的。",
	"But this realm did not wish to be tamed. Quaking cliffs roared in defiance. Seas swelled and swallowed. Flames erupted from the land. Beneath the elements, unknown to the Creators beyond the ashen skies, lived ancient beings who had already claimed this world as their home: the Primordials. These great elemental titans that once dwelt deep within the world now rose from their unseen domain to sunder the land once more. The gods watched as their children, their joy, were flung against the broken rocks or fed to formless terrors unleashed by the destruction. Demonic entities spilled from the umbra of the Abyss to feast on the carnage, called forth by the violence and released to pick the carrion clean.": "但这个王国并不希望被驯服。颤抖的悬崖发出蔑视的吼声。海水涌动并吞噬。火焰从土地上喷发出来。在这些元素之下，在灰暗的天空之外，创造者们不知道，生活着古老的生命，他们已经声称这个世界是他们的家：原始人。这些曾经居住在世界深处的伟大的元素巨头，现在从他们看不见的领域中站起来，再次分裂了这片土地。诸神看着他们的孩子，他们的欢乐，被扔到破碎的岩石上，或者被喂给毁灭所释放的无形的恐怖。恶魔的实体从深渊的保护罩中溢出，在这场大屠杀中大快朵颐，它们被暴力所召唤，被释放出来，将腐肉采摘干净。",
	"Some gods were so full of grief and anger that they wished to leave this world behind and start anew. They tried to convince their divine kindred to join with the Primordials, allowing chaos to reclaim the realm. Other gods wished to remain and subdue the Primordials, to tame the land for the sake of their creations. Thus was created a divide among the gods. Celestial sentinels once dedicated to battling the chaotic forces of the Abyss now fell to hate and tyranny, forging new hells under a fallen angel now claiming lordship over all the realms of sulfur and brimstone.": "一些神明充满了悲伤和愤怒，他们希望离开这个世界，重新开始。他们试图说服他们的神族与原始人结合，让混沌重新获得这个领域。其他神灵则希望留下并制服原始人，为了他们的创造物驯服这片土地。因此，诸神之间产生了分歧。曾经致力于与深渊的混乱力量作斗争的天体哨兵现在倒向了仇恨和暴政，在一个堕落天使的领导下建立了新的地狱，现在声称是所有硫磺和硫磺界的主宰。",
	"The Creators that remained, wishing to salvage their home, their creations, and their realized selves, were forced to take up arms and learn to protect that which they valued most. They organized their followers and taught them how to draw from the powers of creation on their own: to build, to change, and to destroy, all without the aid of divine power. Mortals learned to defend themselves through practices such as alchemy or by bending the very fabrics of existence, though on a smaller scale than that of their creators.": "留下来的创造者，希望挽救他们的家园、他们的创造物和他们实现的自我，被迫拿起武器，学习保护他们最珍视的东西。他们组织了自己的追随者，并教他们如何从自己的创造物中汲取力量：建造、改变和破坏，所有这些都不需要神力的帮助。凡人学会了通过炼金术等做法来保护自己，或者通过弯曲存在的结构来保护自己，尽管规模比他们的创造者要小。",
	"This gift was the knowledge of arcane magic, which the good children used to drive away their traitorous kin, banish the turned Creators to their own prison-like planes, and ultimately destroy the Primordials, scattering the chaotic elements to their own planes of existence. The world was at peace for the first time since its creation, and the first real civilization took root and grew into a grand city called Vasselheim. The Cradle of Creation. The Dawn City.": "这份礼物是关于奥术的知识，好孩子们用它赶走了他们的叛徒亲戚，把变异的创造者驱逐到他们自己的监狱般的星球上，并最终摧毁了原始人，把混乱的元素分散到他们自己的存在星球上。世界自创世以来第一次处于和平状态，第一个真正的文明扎根于此，并成长为一个名为瓦塞尔海姆的宏伟城市。创造的摇篮。黎明之城。",
	"Culture developed anew, the races ventured forth to discover and explore their own lands, and great music filled the air to give a name to this world once and for all: Exandria.": "文化得以重新发展，各族人民勇于发现和探索自己的土地，伟大的音乐在空气中弥漫，为这个世界永远地命名了。艾克桑德里亚。",
	"Over time, some of the people of Exandria grew arrogant. Seeing their arcane gifts as proof that the gods held no sway over their fate, a belief developed that, with enough understanding, they too could become as powerful as the gods. Many began to shun faith in favor of their own pursuits. Though this hurt and surprised the Creators, they understood the willfulness of their children and endured out of love and hope for redemption.": "随着时间的推移，埃克桑德里亚的一些人变得傲慢起来。他们把自己的奥术天赋看作是诸神无法左右他们命运的证明，于是产生了一种信念，认为只要有足够的理解力，他们也可以变得和诸神一样强大。许多人开始回避信仰，支持他们自己的追求。虽然这让创世主感到痛苦和惊讶，但他们理解他们孩子的任性，并出于爱和对救赎的希望而忍耐着。",
	"Great kingdoms sprung up across Exandria. Castles were built in a day, accelerated by the arcanists' newfound power. Erudite cities hovered and drifted through the skies, shifting under the direction of scholarly magi to wherever their interests took them. Even though magic could be used to complete the most difficult tasks with hitherto unknown speed, magic-users strove always to innovate. As mages practiced and perfected their powers of creation, they soon unlocked the secrets of life itself, giving birth to wondrous, dangerous new creatures and power. Powerful archmages such as Vecna the Whispered One and Halas Lutagran began to carve their paths into history during this era of unbridled magical experimentation.": "伟大的王国在埃克桑德里亚各地兴起。在奥术师新发现的力量的推动下，城堡在一天之内建成。博学者的城市在天空中盘旋和漂移，在学者型魔法师的指挥下，他们的兴趣所在就会转移。尽管魔法可以被用来以前所未有的速度完成最困难的任务，但魔法使用者一直在努力创新。随着法师们练习和完善他们的创造能力，他们很快就解开了生命本身的秘密，诞生了奇妙的、危险的新生物和力量。强大的大法师，如低语者韦克纳和哈拉斯-卢塔格兰，在这个肆无忌惮的魔法实验时代开始在历史上刻下他们的足迹。",
	"The advent of the arcane seemed to be the key to a bountiful age of plenty but also proved to threaten it, as prosperity soon gave way to greed. Petty squabbles erupted over resources and wealth among the elite, while the rumor of immortality through perfected arcanum began to drive the greatest mages wild with a lust for unending power. One mortal mage, her name either lost or struck from history, crafted now-forbidden rites to challenge the God of Death, felling him and taking his place among the pantheon, making her the first and only mortal to ascend to godhood. The archmage Vespin Chloras was inspired by this display. Driven by his hunger, he sought the guidance and power of the banished gods, rending open the gates of their prisons and releasing the betrayers into the mortal world.": "奥术的出现似乎是通往富足时代的关键，但也被证明是对它的威胁，因为繁荣很快让位于贪婪。精英们为了争夺资源和财富爆发了小规模的争吵，而通过完善的奥术实现不朽的传言开始让最伟大的法师们疯狂地追求无尽的力量。有一个凡人法师，她的名字要么已经消失，要么已经从历史中抹去，她制作了现在被禁止的仪式来挑战死亡之神，杀死了他并在万神殿中占据了他的位置，使她成为第一个也是唯一一个升为神的凡人。大法师维斯平-克洛拉斯受到了这次展示的启发。在饥饿的驱使下，他寻求被放逐的诸神的指导和力量，打开了他们监狱的大门，将背叛者释放到凡间。",
	"During their imprisonment, these gods of hatred and despair twisted their prison into their own image, spawning unthinkable horrors that lived only to transform peace into suffering, and righteousness into arrogance and greed. The Nine Hells and the Abyss began to push their way into Creation. The Betrayer Gods and their hateful children discovered a world unspoiled, save for the avarice of mortals. The urge to ruin was now replaced with the desire to dominate, and the Betrayer Gods began by turning on the mage who freed them, making Archmage Vespin their first thrall. This corrupted divinity sought out the remnants of their offspring, scattered across the world, and created a mighty and terrible new kingdom on the plains of Xhorhas, at the far end of the world from Vasselheim—Ghor Dranas.": "在监禁期间，这些仇恨和绝望之神将他们的监狱扭曲成他们自己的形象，催生出难以想象的恐怖，他们活着只是为了将和平变成痛苦，将正义变成傲慢和贪婪。九层地狱和深渊开始向创世组织推进。背叛者诸神和他们可恨的孩子们发现了一个未受污染的世界，除了凡人的贪婪。毁灭的冲动现在被统治的欲望所取代，背叛者诸神开始背叛释放他们的法师，使大法师维斯平成为他们的第一个傀儡。这个堕落的神祗寻找他们散落在世界各地的后代的残余，并在Xhorhas平原上建立了一个强大而可怕的新王国，在世界的尽头，离Vasselheim-Ghor Dranas很远。",
	"In this land of evil, where the twisted power of the lower planes seeped into Exandria, the lords of darkness tainted the minds of mortals, hungrily welcoming those who had lost their way, and offering great promises and boons to hearts easily swayed. These poisonous seeds found fertile ground in the hearts of mortals obsessed with the unlimited power of the arcane. With a legion of the damned behind them, the Betrayer Gods soon made their presence known to the world with an assault on Vasselheim itself.": "在这片邪恶的土地上，下层世界扭曲的力量渗入了埃克桑德里亚，黑暗的领主们玷污了凡人的思想，他们饥渴地欢迎那些迷失方向的人，并向容易动摇的心提供巨大的承诺和恩惠。这些有毒的种子在痴迷于奥术的无限力量的凡人心中找到了肥沃的土壤。背叛者之神在他们身后有一个被诅咒的军团，他们很快就向世界表明了他们的存在，对瓦塞尔海姆本身进行了攻击。",
	"Though much of the city was reduced to rubble, Vasselheim weathered the initial assault, saved by the intervention of the Prime Deities themselves, who descended to trade blows with their former brethren. The battle between divinity and mortals, between heroes and demons, raged ceaselessly for twenty days and nights until the dark forces, their surprise attack thwarted, were finally forced to retreat.": "虽然城市的大部分都变成了废墟，但瓦塞尔海姆还是经受住了最初的攻击，由于主神们的干预，他们亲自下凡与他们以前的兄弟们交手，从而拯救了他们。神性与凡人之间的战斗，英雄与恶魔之间的战斗，无休止地持续了20个昼夜，直到黑暗势力的突袭受挫，最终被迫撤退。",
	"Evil was repulsed momentarily, but with the revelation of such a terrible foe, a dangerous arcane arms race began. Trust was shattered indefinitely: if mortals could fall under the sway of the Betrayer Gods, who was an ally? If ruin like this could be unleashed under the watchful eyes of the gods, how were they relevant? Not trusting any but themselves, the self-interested and singular humans reforged their instruments of celebration into instruments of incredible power—artifacts that could be wielded by worthy heroes. The dwarves' fascination with rock and earth turned toward isolation as they burrowed deeper into the mountains, using their divine gifts to animate legions of autonomous golems to protect their ancestral halls. Elves used their understanding of creation's beauty and intricacies to weave spells of unimaginable destructive force, the likes of which Exandria had never seen before.": "邪恶暂时被击退了，但随着这样一个可怕敌人的出现，一场危险的奥术军备竞赛开始了。信任被无限期地打破了：如果凡人可以落入背叛者诸神的控制之下，那么谁是盟友？如果这样的毁灭能在众神的注视下被释放出来，那么他们又有什么意义？除了他们自己，他们不相信任何人，自利的、单一的人类将他们的庆祝工具重新锻造成具有难以置信的力量的工具--可以由有价值的英雄挥舞的神器。矮人对岩石和泥土的迷恋转向了与世隔绝，他们把自己的神赐之物用于激活自主戈壁军团，以保护他们的祖先大厅。精灵们利用他们对造物之美的理解和错综复杂的关系，编织出具有难以想象的破坏力的法术，艾克桑德里亚从未见过这样的法术。",
	"For the first time since the Primordials were destroyed, the focus of magic was warfare. The gods themselves agreed to join their children on the field of battle, descending from the heavens to take up arms once more for the war now referred to as the Calamity.": "自原始人被摧毁以来，魔法的焦点第一次变成了战争。诸神自己也同意在战场上加入他们的孩子，从天而降，再次拿起武器参加现在被称为 \"灾祸 \"的战争。",
	"The battlefields of the catastrophic showdowns of the Calamity were scattered across Exandria, but it was Wynandir that suffered the full destructive powers of the gods. Divided by the Ashkeeper Peaks, the fields of Wynandir were once home to several powerful ruling houses, squabbling over their own goals before being drawn into either side of the conflict of the gods, or abstaining for their own reasons. The immensity of power wielded by the Prime Deities and Betrayer Gods was enough to wound the landscape for eons, and the irresponsible use of arcane knowledge developed by the mortals ensured the ruin of their own legacy.": "灾难性决斗的战场散布在艾克桑德里亚，但威南迪尔却遭受了诸神的全部破坏性力量。怀南迪尔的田野被阿什守卫者山峰分割开来，曾经是几个强大的统治家族的家园，在被卷入诸神冲突的任何一方之前，他们为自己的目标争吵不休，或者因为自己的原因而弃权不干。主神和背叛者诸神所挥舞的巨大力量足以让这片土地伤痕累累，而凡人对奥术知识的不负责任的使用则确保了他们自身遗产的毁灭。",
	"Little record remains of the terrible war, but its effects are still felt today. The sheer magnitude of the energies unleashed in the ensuing battles by gods and mortals alike was enough to fray the boundaries holding back the elemental chaos, spilling unbridled destruction into the world. It completely rearranged the known flow of magical ley energy across Exandria. The dark kingdom of Ghor Dranas was reduced to ash, but the conflict devastated Exandria's peoples, razing entire cities and inspiring in many a desire to flee from this plane of existence entirely. So great was the loss of life during the war that historians believe no more than a third of Exandria's population survived, leaving only one remaining bastion of civilization: the Dawn City, Vasselheim.": "这场可怕的战争几乎没有留下任何记录，但其影响至今仍能感受到。在随后的战斗中，诸神和凡人所释放出的能量之大，足以破坏阻挡元素混乱的边界，将肆无忌惮的毁灭洒向世界。它完全重新安排了整个埃克桑德里亚已知的魔法雷电能量的流动。古尔-德拉纳斯的黑暗王国化为灰烬，但这场冲突摧毁了埃克桑德里亚的人民，夷平了整个城市，激发了许多人完全逃离这个存在平面的愿望。战争中的生命损失是如此之大，以至于历史学家认为艾克桑德里亚的人口中只有三分之一的人幸存下来，只剩下一个文明的堡垒：黎明之城，瓦瑟海姆。",
	"The world entered a long, dark period of regrowth. The Betrayer Gods were banished once more to their realms of deception and hate, but the threat of their return weighed heavily on the world. The Prime Deities felt that their involvement in mortal conflict was to blame for the cataclysmic damage inflicted on Exandria. They knew that while the divine gateways were left open, the prison planes that held the banished Betrayers would remain imperfect and temporary.": "世界进入了一个漫长而黑暗的再生期。背叛者诸神再次被放逐到他们的欺骗和仇恨领域，但他们回来的威胁对这个世界造成了沉重的负担。主神们认为，他们参与了凡人的冲突，是对埃克桑德里亚造成的灾难性破坏的责任。他们知道，虽然神圣的通道是开放的，但关押被放逐的背叛者的监狱平面仍然是不完善和暂时的。",
	"Thus, hoping to ensure that such ruin would not befall Exandria again, they left their children to fend for themselves. The Creators returned to their own realms, dragging both Betrayer and abomination with them and sealing the pathways to the mortal realm behind them with the Divine Gate. Only in this way could they prevent their corrupted brethren from physically returning to the material plane. Sadly, for the Prime Deities, this action also carried with it a self-imposed sentence of exile. The Creators would henceforth never be allowed to visit their creation.": "因此，他们希望确保这样的毁灭不会再次降临到埃克桑德里亚，就把他们的孩子留给了自己照顾。创造者们回到了他们自己的领域，拖着背叛者和憎恶，用神门封住了他们身后通往凡人世界的通道。只有这样，他们才能阻止他们被腐蚀的兄弟们回到物质界。可悲的是，对于主神来说，这一行动也带来了一个自我放逐的判决。创造者们从此将不被允许访问他们的创造物。",
	"The disappearance of the gods is known by many names: the Second Spark for those who study the arcane, and the Penance for those who seek closeness to their gods. The most common name for this time of warfare and divine separation is the Divergence, and it marked the end of the Age of Arcanum.": "众神的消失有很多名字：研究奥术的人叫 \"第二火花\"，寻求与神灵亲近的人叫 \"忏悔\"。这段战乱和神灵分离的时期最常见的名字是分歧，它标志着奥术时代的结束。",
	"Much time has passed since, and the world has been reborn once again. The gods still influence and guide from beyond the Divine Gate, bestowing knowledge and power on their worshipers, but the path of mortals is now their own to make. New cities, kingdoms, and cultures have retaken the world, building over the ashes of the old. New songs fill the air, and the hope of a brighter future drives people day after day, while buried ruins and ancient relics remind all people of a darker time of mistakes that should never be repeated.": "自此以后，许多时间过去了，世界再次重生。诸神仍然在神门之外影响和引导，将知识和力量赋予他们的崇拜者，但凡人的道路现在由他们自己来决定。新的城市、王国和文化已经重新占领了世界，在旧的灰烬上建设。新的歌曲充斥着空气，对更光明的未来的希望日复一日地驱使着人们，而被埋葬的废墟和古老的遗迹则提醒所有的人，一个更黑暗的时代的错误永远不应该被重复。",
	"In the wake of the vast destruction of the Calamity and the exile of the pantheon in the Divergence, the survivors began to emerge from the ash and shadows to reclaim and rebuild Exandria. Across the continents, many took the pieces of their cultures and sought a place to forge a new age. This tome focuses on the rebirth of the deeply scarred land now known as Wildemount, the site of the most terrible conflicts of the Calamity, where the echoes of those deadly battles linger to this day.": "在灾难的巨大破坏和万神殿在分歧中被放逐之后，幸存者开始从灰烬和阴影中走出来，重新获得并重建艾克桑德里亚。在各大洲，许多人带着他们文化的碎片，寻找一个地方来打造一个新时代。这本小册子着重介绍了现在被称为荒野山庄的那片伤痕累累的土地的重生，这里是灾变中最可怕的冲突的发生地，那些致命的战斗的回声至今仍在那里徘徊。",
	"After the Calamity, the lands of Wildemount became wild and perilous, filled with monstrosities and beasts that prowled its broken fields and shattered mountains. The land's new denizens reclaimed the newly untamed realm, hunting any mortals not clever enough to hide. The masterless creations of the Betrayer Gods ruled their own territories, establishing themselves as a new pantheon.": "灾难过后，荒野山庄的土地变得狂野而危险，充满了怪兽和野兽，在破碎的田野和破碎的山脉中游荡。这片土地上的新居民开垦了新的未被驯服的领域，猎杀任何不够聪明的凡人来躲避。背叛者诸神的无主创造物统治着他们自己的领土，建立了自己的新神殿。",
	"As the dust settled, surviving mortals grasped at what they could from their bygone lives and hid away in fear of what would come next. Those of faith dealt with their sense of failure and abandonment, while enlightened scribes mourned the loss of their research and the great magical secrets that had enabled the previous age to rise to such prominence.": "随着尘埃落定，幸存的凡人从他们过去的生活中抓住了他们可以抓住的东西，并因害怕接下来会发生什么而躲藏起来。那些有信仰的人处理他们的失败和被遗弃感，而开明的文士们则哀悼他们的研究和伟大的魔法秘密的损失，这些秘密使前一个时代能够如此突出。",
	"Others picked up what they could from the ruins and chose to start anew, hoping that their descendants would learn from their mistakes. Over those early centuries, the scattered survivors fought back the terrors that stalked the abandoned lands of Wildemount, continuing to endure and build new societies, civilizations that eventually reclaimed Wildemount and brought the world to this modern age.": "其他人则从废墟中捡起他们能捡到的东西，选择重新开始，希望他们的后代能从他们的错误中吸取教训。在那些早期的几个世纪里，分散的幸存者抵抗着徘徊在荒野山庄废弃土地上的恐怖，继续忍受并建立新的社会，这些文明最终夺回了荒野山庄，并将世界带到了这个现代时代。",
	"The lands of Western Wynandir were the epicenter of the Calamity's destruction. Rocky ranges of mountains were sundered, entire landscapes burned, and hovering seats of power crashed down from the sky, their floating cities consumed beneath the hungry earth.": "西部威南迪尔的土地是这场灾难破坏的中心。绵延的山脉被摧毁，整个地貌被烧毁，盘旋的权力机构从空中坠落，其漂浮的城市在饥饿的大地之下被吞噬。",
	"The dwarven clan of Grimgol that once helped hold the center of the Ashkeeper Peaks was nearly wiped out during the Calamity. The surviving families and warriors burrowed deep beneath the surface of Exandria to wait out the chaos. Collapsing nearly every established tunnel used in the wars above, the clan found themselves cut off from the rest of Exandria. For centuries, the dwarves of Clan Grimgol endured the darkness alone, defending against the dregs of the Betrayer Gods' forces and adapting themselves into a hardy and stalwart people.": "曾经帮助守住灰烬守护者山峰中心的矮人部族在灾变中几乎被消灭了。幸存的家族和战士们在埃克桑德里亚的地表下深埋，等待混乱的到来。几乎所有在上面的战争中使用过的既定隧道都坍塌了，该部族发现自己与埃克桑德里亚的其他地方隔绝了。几个世纪以来，格里高尔氏族的矮人独自忍受着黑暗，抵御背叛者之神的残余势力，并将自己改造成一个坚韧而顽强的民族。",
	"Half-remembered tales and myths of their forgotten history, mingled with worship of Moradin, began to stir an eagerness to return to their ancestral home and build anew. With new purpose, they carved their way back toward the surface, only to find the mountains of their home reduced to dust and pebbles.": "他们被遗忘的历史的半记得的故事和神话，与对莫拉丁的崇拜混在一起，开始激起他们返回祖先的家园和重新建设的渴望。带着新的目标，他们向地表凿去，却发现他们家园的山脉已化为灰尘和卵石。",
	"Not easily dissuaded, the dwarves returned to the surface for the first time in generations, finding the once-ruined world now recovering with renewed life and color. The resilient clan made their way north along the Brokenveil Bluffs and found a massive mountain to house their new city. They built their stronghold into this monolith among the Dunrock Mountains, and gave their new home the name of Grimgolir.": "矮人并没有被轻易劝阻，他们几代人以来第一次回到地面，发现曾经被破坏的世界正在恢复新的生命和色彩。坚韧不拔的部族沿着断肠崖一路向北，找到了一座巨大的山，作为他们新城市的所在地。他们在敦罗克山中的这块巨石上建立了自己的据点，并给他们的新家起了一个名字--格林戈里尔。",
	"In the Marrow Valley, the numerous decades following the Divergence left the landscape blackened and inhospitable. The remaining people struggled for food and shelter as they wandered the rocky hills for centuries, avoiding the colder weather of the north. Nomadic sects of humans and halflings defended themselves against the hungry beasts and lingering evils threatening their homesteads, and fought with each other over fertile land.": "在马罗河谷，分歧之后的无数个年代使地貌变黑、荒凉。剩下的人们为了食物和住所而挣扎，他们在岩石山丘上游荡了几个世纪，避开了北方的寒冷天气。人类和半身人的游牧教派抵御饥饿的野兽和威胁其家园的挥之不去的邪恶，并为争夺肥沃的土地而相互争斗。",
	"Small civilizations began to form amid the chaos, but it wasn't until the central township of Zadash was established as a safe outpost that the unification of the Marrow Valley began. Helmed by the Julous family, supposedly of noble blood from before the Calamity, a guarded community with an organized military force was built in the center of the valley around four hundred years ago. It became both a haven for the struggling masses and a center for agricultural expansion.": "小型文明开始在混乱中形成，但直到扎达什中心镇作为一个安全的前哨建立起来，马罗河谷的统一才开始。在朱鲁斯家族的领导下，据说在灾变之前就有贵族血统，大约四百年前在山谷的中心建立了一个有组织的军事力量的守卫社区。它既成为挣扎的大众的避难所，也成为农业扩张的中心。",
	"Increasing their strength with each generation, this movement guided by the Julous family became known as the Julous Dominion, stretching across the south end of Western Wynandir. Not all agreed to join the Julous Dominion, however. Some outliers rejected the Julous interests, founding their own village of Kamordah on the boiling earth of the hills in the southwest Marrow Valley. In time, the people of Kamordah came to worship a being of primordial fire that lives beneath the mountains and speaks to them in dreams and visions.": "每一代人的力量都在增加，这场由朱鲁斯家族指导的运动被称为朱鲁斯统治区，横跨西威南迪尔的南端。然而，并非所有的人都同意加入朱鲁斯统治区。一些离群索居者拒绝了朱鲁斯的利益，在西南部马罗谷的山丘沸腾的土地上建立了他们自己的卡莫达村。随着时间的推移，卡莫达的人们开始崇拜一个住在山下的原始火种，并在梦境和幻觉中与他们交谈。",
	"In the frigid fields north of the Marrow Valley, the survivors of the Arcanum city of Zemniaz scraped by in the snow for centuries, clutching their surviving scrolls and fragments of cultural history. They established the dour outposts of Icehaven and Yrrosa, but it wasn't until the Zemnian people wandered east to the Pearlbow Wilderness that they found fields that were fertile enough to nurture a new society.": "在骨髓谷北部寒冷的原野上，阿卡诺姆城市泽姆尼亚斯的幸存者在雪地上苟延残喘了几个世纪，紧紧抓住他们幸存的卷轴和文化历史的碎片。他们建立了冰港和Yrrosa的沉闷前哨，但直到泽姆尼亚斯人向东流浪到珍珠弓荒野，他们才发现了足以孕育一个新社会的肥沃土地。",
	"Founded atop the ruins of an ancient temple to the Dawn Father, the city of Rexxentrum rose to become the hub of Zemnian culture. Now that the Zemnian people no longer had to struggle for survival amid the harsh elements, their leaders argued over how to establish a centralized government. Some wished for a republic, while others sought a theocracy under the priests that shepherded the people into this new age. Eckhardt Dwendal, a well-respected merchant and tremendous force behind the development of Rexxentrum, wished to institute a monarchy and place his son Manfried on the throne. Debate spun wildly for over three years, while Eckhardt privately made deals with the heads of the emerging guilds, using promises or blackmail to secure their cooperation. With the resounding support of the flourishing guild heads, the throne was established. In the year 539 of the post-Divergence era, Manfried became the first emperor of the Dwendalian Empire.": "在一座古老的黎明之父神庙的废墟上建立起来的雷克森特鲁姆城，成为泽姆尼亚文化的中心。现在，泽姆尼亚人不再需要在恶劣的环境中为生存而挣扎，他们的领导人为如何建立一个中央集权的政府而争论不休。一些人希望建立一个共和国，而另一些人则寻求在牧民进入这个新时代的祭司的领导下建立神权。埃克哈特-德文达尔（Eckhardt Dwendal）是一位备受尊敬的商人，也是雷克辛顿发展背后的巨大力量，他希望建立一个君主制，让他的儿子曼弗雷德（Manfried）登上王位。辩论疯狂地进行了三年多，而埃克哈特私下里与新兴行会的负责人进行了交易，用承诺或敲诈来确保他们的合作。在蓬勃发展的行会首脑的响亮支持下，王位得以确立。在后分歧时代的539年，曼弗雷德成为德文达尔帝国的第一位皇帝。",
	"It wasn't long before the expanding borders of the Dwendalian Empire began to push up against the growing Julous Dominion. An agreement was brokered to avoid conflict as long as favorable trade could be established and maintained. Even so, the resource-rich center of Western Wynandir was split between the two states, with both factions eager to discover the other's weaknesses. Rumors of the discovery of a massive platinum mine within the Julous Dominion further increased the empire's desire to conquer their neighbor.": "没过多久，德文达尔帝国不断扩张的边界就开始向日益壮大的朱鲁斯统治区逼近。双方达成了一项协议，只要能够建立和维持有利的贸易，就可以避免冲突。即便如此，资源丰富的西威南迪尔中心还是被两个国家分割开来，两个派别都急于发现对方的弱点。关于在朱鲁斯领地内发现大规模铂金矿的传言进一步增加了帝国征服邻国的欲望。",
	"At this time, religious leaders throughout the Dwendalian Empire rebelled against the emperor's religious restrictions. After his coronation, Emperor Manfried Dwendal enacted laws limiting worship and prayer to subjects concerning the power, profit, and expansion of the empire. In the year 544 PD, internal strife and insurgent action turned bloody when the zealous leaders of varying faiths attempted, and failed, to usurp the throne for their council. An angered Emperor Manfried Dwendal had the rebellious priests executed—an event that came to be known as the Admonition.": "这时，整个德文达尔帝国的宗教领袖都在反抗皇帝的宗教限制。在加冕之后，曼弗雷德-德文达尔皇帝颁布了法律，将崇拜和祈祷限制在有关帝国权力、利润和扩张的主题上。公元544年，不同信仰的狂热领袖试图为他们的议会篡夺王位，但没有成功，内部纷争和叛乱行动变得血腥。愤怒的皇帝曼弗雷德-德文达尔（Manfried Dwendal）将叛乱的祭司处死--这一事件被称为 \"训诫\"。",
	"The emperor spoke of abolishing all worship within his boundaries. This caused further uproar among the populace, but then Emperor Manfried's spies discovered that the seeds of the uprising had been sown by Julous interests. Publicly exposing the plot, the emperor outlawed only select faiths that he felt threatened civilized life. He redirected much of the people's fury by also proclaiming the Julous Dominion an enemy of the empire later that year and declaring war on the neighboring nation.": "皇帝说要在他的地盘上废除一切崇拜。这在民众中引起了进一步的骚动，但随后曼弗雷德皇帝的间谍发现，起义的种子是由朱鲁斯利益集团播下的。皇帝公开揭露了这一阴谋，只取缔了他认为威胁到文明生活的特定信仰。当年晚些时候，他还宣布朱鲁斯领地为帝国的敌人，并向这个邻国宣战，从而转移了人们的大部分怒火。",
	"Meanwhile, the Julous Dominion was dealing with the refusal of the outlying villages near Kamordah to accept their rule in this time of brewing hostility. They eventually drove the independent villagers back into the Cyrios Mountains, just in time to hear the horns of war blaring from the empire to the north. The violent conflict known as the Marrow War lasted over sixteen months and cost the lives of many soldiers and innocents on both sides of the Marrow Valley.": "与此同时，朱鲁斯统治区正在处理卡莫达附近的外围村庄拒绝接受他们在这个酝酿敌意的时期的统治的问题。他们最终将独立的村民赶回了赛里奥斯山脉，正好听到北方帝国响起的战争号角。被称为马罗战争的暴力冲突持续了16个多月，马罗河谷两边的许多士兵和无辜者都付出了生命。",
	"The Julous Dominion lacked the unified military force of the empire. When a major military push left the capital city of Zadash occupied by the empire, Baron Inock Julous and Baroness Tessandra Julous met with Emperor Manfried to negotiate a peace. During this meeting, the baron and baroness were unceremoniously executed. Their bodies were displayed publicly along with the narrative that they had attempted an assassination on the emperor during the peace talks. Disheartened and bereft of leadership, the Julous Dominion immediately came to an end, as did the war.": "朱鲁斯统治区缺乏帝国的统一军事力量。当一次重大的军事行动让帝国的首都扎达什被占领时，伊诺克-朱鲁斯男爵和泰桑德拉-朱鲁斯男爵夫人与曼弗雷德皇帝会面，商讨和平事宜。在这次会面中，男爵和男爵夫人被毫不客气地处决了。他们的尸体连同他们在和谈期间试图暗杀皇帝的说法一起被公开展示。沮丧和失去领导的朱鲁斯王朝立即结束，战争也随之结束。",
	"To prove his benevolence to the people of the newly conquered Julous Dominion, and to help avoid future uprisings, Emperor Manfried declared that all citizens of the dominion would keep their lands and homesteads. No soldiers would stand trial or be punished for their previous allegiance. Life would continue as it had, except for the implementation of imperial taxes, laws, and oversight across the valley under the new emperor. Outlawed religious iconography was destroyed, crops and goods were redistributed according to the needs of the empire, and life slowly returned to normal for the Zemnian people.": "为了证明他对新征服的朱鲁斯领地的人民的仁慈，并帮助避免未来的起义，曼弗雷德皇帝宣布，该领地的所有公民将保留他们的土地和宅基地。没有士兵会因为他们以前的效忠而接受审判或受到惩罚。除了在新皇帝的领导下在整个山谷实施帝国的税收、法律和监督之外，生活将继续保持原样。被取缔的宗教图腾被销毁，作物和货物根据帝国的需要被重新分配，泽姆尼亚人的生活慢慢恢复了正常。",
	"With citizens of the former Julous Dominion tense beneath their new rule and a growing sentiment of frustration with imperial leadership building, Emperor Manfried sought a way to reform the nation under his banner. The propagandist minds who fought the social war with the Julous Dominion recommended a shift in public image and title, one that could command more respect within Western Wynandir while casting aside the oppressive connotations of the title of emperor. Still riding high on the victory against the Dominion, Emperor Manfried harkened back to the halcyon lore of the Age of Arcanum, recalling the beloved kings and queens of old. It was decided that the people would no longer have an emperor, but a king. Crowning himself the first of the line of Dwendalian kings, King Manfried insisted on maintaining the now-ominous national title of the Dwendalian Empire, famously proclaiming, \"I am the Dwendalian king to my people, beloved and open to their wishes. To our enemies, we remain resolute and unstoppable. We are the Dwendalian Empire.\"": "前朱鲁斯领地的公民在他们的新统治下感到紧张，对帝国领导层的挫败感越来越强烈，曼弗雷德皇帝寻求一种方法来改革他旗下的国家。与朱鲁斯统治区进行社会战争的宣传家们建议改变公众形象和头衔，一个能在西维南迪尔获得更多尊重的头衔，同时抛开皇帝头衔的压迫性内涵。曼弗雷德皇帝还在为战胜多米尼克而兴奋不已，他回想起了阿卡努姆时代的美好传说，回忆起古老的受人喜爱的国王和女王。决定人民将不再有一个皇帝，而是一个国王。曼弗雷德国王自封为德文达里的第一位国王，他坚持维持现在德文达里帝国这一著名的国家头衔，著名地宣称：\"对我的人民来说，我是德文达里的国王，受人爱戴，对他们的愿望开放。对于我们的敌人，我们仍然是坚定的，不可阻挡的。我们是德文达里亚帝国\"。",
	"Not a quarter century after the Marrow War ended and the line of kings was established, a smaller, internal conflict rocked the capital city of Rexxentrum. A number of noble houses with a strong history of studying arcane pursuits began to compete with other high-born magic practitioners from the Julous Dominion. Throughout the lands of the newly expanded empire, these houses escalated their subterfuge and espionage against one another, until the rivalry finally erupted into an all-out magical conflict in the streets of the capital itself.": "在马罗战争结束和王系建立后不到四分之一个世纪，一场较小的内部冲突震撼了首都雷克森特姆。一些有着浓厚的研究奥术历史的贵族家族开始与来自朱鲁斯领地的其他高血统的魔法从业者竞争。在整个新扩张的帝国的土地上，这些家族不断升级他们的潜规则和间谍活动，直到竞争最终在首都的街道上爆发为一场全面的魔法冲突。",
	"The events of the Eve of Crimson Midnight destroyed numerous buildings and maimed a number of innocents caught in the crossfire. The struggle ended with all involved shackled and brought before the king. After days of deliberation, an agreement was drawn up that would absolve those involved of the usual punishment in exchange for direct subservience to the Crown and the goals of the empire. Establishing themselves as the Cerberus Assembly, this council of mages became a powerful tool for the empire to maintain its position as the dominant force of Wildemount.": "深红午夜前夕的事件摧毁了许多建筑物，并使一些无辜者在交火中致残。斗争结束后，所有参与的人都被戴上镣铐，被带到国王面前。经过几天的商议，一项协议被起草出来，该协议将免除那些参与其中的人的常规惩罚，以换取对王室和帝国目标的直接服从。这个法师委员会建立了自己的地狱之神大会，成为帝国维持其作为野蛮人主导力量地位的有力工具。",
	"For three hundred years, the empire has expanded and prospered under the rule of the Dwendalian line of kings. King Alfwin Dwendal increased the empire's military power by establishing the stronghold of Bladegarden and assimilating Grimgolir into the empire, seeking to hold back the savage creatures of Xhorhas. King Theoderich Dwendal's benevolent nature brokered the partnership with the Clovis Concord of the Menagerie Coast without bloodshed and ushered in new opportunities for trade with the rest of Exandria. King Willamar Dwendal established the initial prominence of House Truscan and granted them oversight of the Truscan Vale, to the displeasure of the other noble houses.": "三百年来，帝国在德文达尔王系的统治下不断扩张和繁荣。阿尔夫温-德文达尔国王通过建立布拉德加登的据点和将格林戈里尔同化到帝国中来增强了帝国的军事力量，力求阻挡Xhorhas的野蛮生物。西奥德里奇-德文达尔国王的仁慈本性在没有流血的情况下促成了与美纳吉海岸的克洛维斯协约的合作，并迎来了与埃克桑德里亚其他地区贸易的新机会。威拉玛-德文达尔国王确立了特鲁斯卡家族最初的显赫地位，并授予他们对特鲁斯卡谷地的监督权，这让其他贵族家族很不高兴。",
	"Other kings have come and gone, but few have made as immediate and lasting a mark as King Bertrand Dwendal. On assuming the throne in 790 PD, King Bertrand immediately demonstrated his love of spectacle and social manipulation by instituting town criers across the empire to disseminate Crown-approved messages. With the aid of Master Ikithon Trent of the Cerberus Assembly, he captured the imagination of the masses with well-crafted tales of his deeds, proclaimed by the criers in every town square.": "其他国王来了又走，但很少有人像贝特朗-德文达尔国王那样留下了直接而持久的印记。公元790年，贝特朗国王一登基，就在帝国各地设立了传令官，传播王室批准的信息，从而立即显示出他对场面和社会操纵的热爱。在Cerberus大会的Ikithon Trent大师的帮助下，他用精心制作的事迹故事吸引了大众的想象力，并由传令兵在每个城镇广场上宣扬。",
	"Seeking to bury any dissent against the Crown, King Dwendal began to use the empire's spy network to seek out sources of unrest in the public and punish those who sowed thoughts of rebellion. Public holidays and celebrations were given greater funding to quell the masses and distract the people from the increase in taxation implemented across the valley. This allowed King Bertrand Dwendal to rise in popularity while also ruling with a far more ruthless and self-serving agenda than most kings before him.": "为了掩盖任何对王室的异议，德文达尔国王开始利用帝国的间谍网络寻找公众的不安源，并惩罚那些播种叛乱思想的人。公共假期和庆祝活动得到了更多的资助，以平息群众的情绪，并分散人们对整个山谷实施的增税的注意力。这使得伯特兰-德文达尔国王的声望上升，同时也以比他之前的大多数国王更无情和更自私的方式进行统治。",
	"King Bertrand maintains the isolationist world view of his predecessors, even in times of need. By ignoring political alliances from distant nations, preventing the construction of any skyship docks within the empire, and ignoring calls for aid—such as the fight against the rising threat of Vecna two decades before—the King believes he has made the empire stronger than it's ever been.": "贝特朗国王保持着其前任的孤立主义世界观，即使在需要的时候也是如此。通过无视来自遥远国家的政治联盟，阻止在帝国内建造任何天空船坞，以及无视援助的呼吁--比如二十年前对抗Vecna的崛起威胁--国王相信他已经使帝国比以往任何时候都更强大。",
	"However, the king's focus on isolationism fades as tensions with Xhorhas grow. Worry about his legacy mingles with the new and deadly threat of the Kryn Dynasty, now emboldened and pushing into his kingdom with strange magics and dangerous warriors. He mistrusts the very Cerberus Assembly that grants him so much influence and arcane might to combat the ever-darker world that barks at the borders of the empire. Public approval of his rule wanes with growing economic disparity, and the whisper of Myriad power returning under his nose only heightens his paranoia.": "然而，随着与Xhorhas的关系日益紧张，国王对孤立主义的关注逐渐消失。对他的遗产的担忧与克莱恩王朝新的致命威胁交织在一起，克莱恩王朝现在有恃无恐，用奇怪的魔法和危险的战士向他的王国推进。他不信任授予他如此大的影响力和神秘力量的地狱犬议会，以对抗在帝国边界叫嚣的越来越黑暗的世界。公众对他的统治的认可随着经济差距的扩大而减弱，而Myriad力量在他眼皮底下回归的悄悄话只会加剧他的妄想。",
	"When the Kryn orchestrated an attack on the Halls of Erudition in Zadash, the Cerberus Assembly pushed for a display of military power to rally the people and bring unity to the national identity of the empire. The king declared war on the Kryn Dynasty and the people of Xhorhas, embroiling the region in this new full-scale conflict, with the hope that, as history has proven, people are easier to unite against a common enemy.": "当克莱恩人策划了对扎达什的博学堂的攻击时，地狱犬议会推动了军事力量的展示，以集结人民并使帝国的国家身份得到统一。国王向克莱恩王朝和Xhorhas的人民宣战，将该地区卷入这场新的全面冲突中，希望正如历史所证明的那样，人们更容易团结起来对抗共同的敌人。",
	"While destruction came to the farthest reaches of the world during the divine conflicts of the Calamity, the islands of the Lucidian Ocean off the western coast of Wildemount thought they might fare better than most. But though they were far removed from the central fury of the magics unleashed in the final battles, the region's civilizations were instead wiped out by massive floods. Immense tidal surges left the coast drowned and empty, the islands consumed by the raging ocean, leaving behind only the most accomplished of sailors. Eventually, the waters settled once more, and nature swiftly reclaimed the lands with lush green jungles.": "在灾变的神圣冲突中，世界上最遥远的地方都遭到了破坏，而荒野山庄西海岸外的琉璃海岛屿却以为他们的情况会比大多数人好。但是，尽管他们远离了最后战斗中释放的魔法的中心怒火，该地区的文明反而被大规模的洪水所消灭。巨大的潮汐使海岸被淹没，空无一人，岛屿被汹涌的海洋吞噬，只留下了最有成就的水手们。最终，水面再次平静下来，大自然迅速地用郁郁葱葱的丛林恢复了这片土地。",
	"The few scattered survivors of the floods found shelter among the higher jungles of the Swavain Islands, gifted with the bounty of a more plentiful and tropical environment. These seafaring people rebuilt among the islands and took the name Ki'Nau, meaning \"the Water Children\" in their language of Naush. Though the terrible floods of the Calamity had passed, the deadly seas and flourishing horrors of the wilds were still a persistent threat to the Ki'Nau. Each generation struggled to survive the elements that sunk their boats and the predators of the jungles and ocean depths.": "洪水中为数不多的零星幸存者在斯瓦文群岛较高的丛林中找到了庇护所，得到了更丰富的热带环境的恩赐。这些航海者在岛上重建，并取名为Ki'Nau，在他们的纳什语中意为 \"水孩子\"。虽然灾难中可怕的洪水已经过去，但致命的海洋和荒野的繁荣恐怖仍然是对Ki'Nau人持续的威胁。每一代人都在挣扎着，以便在击沉他们的船只和丛林及海洋深处的掠食者的因素中生存。",
	"Over time, an older mind began to call from the waters and entered their dreams. This powerful being, a leviathan creation abandoned by his creator Zehir in the Divergence, called himself Uk'otoa. He spoke of his divinity and promised protection to the Ki'Nau people in exchange for their worship. The Ki'Nau accepted the persuasive entity as an ally and protector, allowing Uk'otoa to rise up as the guardian of the islands and help the Ki'Nau become a proud society of warriors, establishing dominance over the region for centuries.": "随着时间的推移，一个古老的思想开始从水中呼唤，进入他们的梦境。这个强大的生命，是被他的创造者泽希尔在分歧中抛弃的利维坦造物，自称为乌克奥托亚。他谈到了自己的神性，并承诺保护基诺人以换取他们的崇拜。基诺人接受了这个有说服力的实体作为盟友和保护者，让乌克奥托亚作为岛屿的守护者崛起，并帮助基诺人成为一个骄傲的战士社会，在该地区建立了数百年的统治地位。",
	"Around the year 400 PD, an exploration vessel from the distant land of Marquet was nearing the end of its provisions when it reached the Swavain Islands. Discovered and captured by the ever-watchful Ki'Nau, the desperate explorers made trade offerings of foreign gold, spices, and fine silks. This diplomatic approach won over the leaders of the Ki'Nau, and an alliance was made with the Marquesian travelers to return with trade goods and establish a Marquesian outpost, which was to be named Damali.": "公元400年左右，一艘来自遥远的马奎特大陆的探险船在到达斯瓦文群岛时，其供给已经接近尾声。被永远警惕的Ki'Nau发现并捕获，绝望的探险家们用外国的黄金、香料和精美的丝绸作为贸易礼物。这种外交手段赢得了基诺族领导人的支持，并与马克西族旅行者结成联盟，带着贸易货物返回，并建立一个马克西族的前哨站，该站被命名为达马里。",
	"During this time, a cruel seafaring culture called the Vukan discovered the Ki'Nau and coveted their lush homesteads and rich, sea-gathered jewelry. These Vukan began a series of coordinated assaults on the Ki'Nau, killing and kidnapping a number of them under the shadow of night. The Marquesian guilds who had sent the exploration ship agreed to offer naval support to combat these attacks, but it was Uk'otoa whose fury ultimately annihilated the Vukan at their home villages and erased them from Exandria.": "在这期间，一种被称为武康人的残酷航海文化发现了基诺人，并觊觎他们郁郁葱葱的家园和丰富的海中采集的珠宝。这些武康人开始对基诺人进行一系列协调的攻击，在夜幕下杀害和绑架了许多人。派出勘探船的马克西亚行会同意提供海军支援，以打击这些攻击，但最终是乌克托亚的怒火在武坎人的家乡消灭了他们，并将他们从埃克桑德里亚抹去。",
	"Having lost a portion of their fleet in these fights, the surviving Marquesian naval ships remained to build small settlements along the coast to aid in their trade with the Ki'Nau. The Ki'Nau leader Tauan kept a tentative peace with the foreign sailors, but Uk'otoa wanted to dominate the new arrivals who refused to renounce their old gods and bow to him. These tensions came to a head when a secret sect of Marquesian worshipers of the Cloaked Serpent Zehir were given a task by their enraged god from beyond the Divine Gate: to destroy Uk'otoa for his insolence. With the aid of a powerful cult leader within an archeological guild known as the Allegiance of Allsight, a series of temples built to Uk'otoa were corrupted with Zehir's influence and used to seal Uk'otoa deep beneath the rock of the ocean floor, robbing the Ki'Nau of their patron.": "在这些战斗中损失了一部分舰队后，幸存的马克思主义海军舰艇仍然沿着海岸建立小型定居点，以帮助他们与Ki'Nau的贸易。基诺族领导人陶安与外国水手保持着试探性的和平，但乌克奥托亚想支配那些拒绝放弃他们的旧神而向他低头的新来者。当马尔克斯的一个秘密教派的斗篷蛇泽希尔的崇拜者被他们来自神门之外的愤怒的神赋予了一项任务时，这些紧张关系就开始了：摧毁乌克托亚的无礼。在一个被称为 \"Allsight的忠诚 \"的考古行会中一个强大的邪教领袖的帮助下，一系列为Uk'otoa建造的寺庙被泽希尔的影响所腐蚀，并被用来将Uk'otoa封印在海底的岩石下，使Ki'Nau失去了他们的守护者。",
	"At this time, the city of Ank'Harel in Marquet had just named the mysterious J'mon Sa Ord as their new emperor. In the transition, the Marquesian colonists now living along the coast demanded independence from Marquet to begin building their own society and identity alongside the Ki'Nau. Ord eventually accepted the request, and the emancipated Marquesians allied themselves with the Ki'Nau to build a new civilization. Over the following centuries, numerous port towns sprung up and grew into city states, trade routes expanded along what is now known as the Menagerie Coast, and the emerging guilds consolidated enough power to become the region's ruling class: the Clovis Concord.": "此时，马尔凯特的安克哈雷尔市刚刚任命神秘的J'mon Sa Ord为他们的新皇帝。在过渡时期，现在居住在沿海地区的马克思主义殖民者要求从马尔凯特独立出来，开始与基诺族一起建立自己的社会和身份。奥德最终接受了这一请求，被解放的马克思人与基诺人结盟，建立了一个新的文明。在接下来的几个世纪里，无数的港口城镇兴起并发展成为城市国家，贸易路线沿着现在被称为Menagerie海岸的地方扩展，新兴的行会巩固了足够的权力，成为该地区的统治阶层：Clovis Concord。",
	"The concord works together to keep the surrounding Lucidian Ocean under their watch and rule, setting trade laws and guiding the fortunes of those who sail on the open waters. The blend of cultures that forms the Menagerie Coast creates a diverse community where the arts are lauded and coin is king. However, the shadow of the Myriad syndicate continues to infiltrate the streets, while the pirate alliance known as the Revelry has risen to harry the trade routes and rebel against the concord. Tensions are further escalated by the threat of expanding war to the northeast between the Dwendalian Empire and the Kryn Dynasty.": "协约国共同努力，将周围的卢西迪亚海洋置于他们的监视和统治之下，制定贸易法律，指导那些在开放水域航行的人的财富。文化的融合构成了Menagerie海岸，创造了一个多元化的社区，在这里，艺术受到推崇，钱币是国王。然而，Myriad集团的阴影继续渗透到街道上，而被称为 \"狂欢 \"的海盗联盟已经崛起，骚扰贸易路线并反叛协约。东北部的德文达尔帝国和克里恩王朝之间的战争威胁使紧张局势进一步升级。",
	"The fierce powers released in the conflicts of the Calamity tore through the heavily forested region now known as the Greying Wildlands, setting ablaze a slow-burning arcane forest fire that smoldered for nearly a century, burning through the hearty trees of the region like a plague of embers. The northern realm was left desolate, ashes and dirt blown into dust and sand as the chill northern winds transformed the rolling hills into a desert of ice and pebbles. Fleeing remnants of the Grimgol dwarves delved into the snow-hooded Flotket Alps, many freezing to death in the wind-battered valleys before finding safety in the natural caverns hiding deep in the mountain range. Within these icy depths, the dwarves cultivated fiery hearths and brought warmth to the heart of the mountain, establishing the new dwarven city of Uthodurn.": "灾难冲突中释放出的猛烈力量撕裂了现在被称为 \"灰色荒野 \"的茂密森林地区，点燃了一场缓慢燃烧的奥术森林之火，它燃烧了近一个世纪，像一场余烬的瘟疫一样烧毁了该地区的丰饶树木。北部地区一片荒凉，灰烬和泥土被寒冷的北风吹成了灰尘和沙子，连绵的山丘变成了冰和卵石的沙漠。逃亡的格林戈尔矮人残部深入到白雪皑皑的弗洛特克特阿尔卑斯山，许多人在被风吹散的山谷中冻死，然后在隐藏在山脉深处的天然岩洞中找到了安全。在这些冰冷的深处，矮人培植了火热的炉灶，为山的中心地带带来了温暖，建立了新的矮人城市乌索杜恩。",
	"Amid the charred remains of the burning forest that filled the sky with smoke for over a hundred years, one section of the woods defied the flames and held against the embers that battered it. This small patch of idyllic green endured, a sanctuary for the surviving wood elves that held fast and hoped for a miracle. Sensing that the blessings of Melora and Corellon had kept the heart of this forest alive until the fires burned out, the elves began to build a new home among the ancient trees and groves.": "在燃烧的森林的烧焦的残骸中，一百多年来，天空中充满了浓烟，有一片树林不畏烈焰，抵挡住了撞击它的余烬。这一小片田园诗般的绿色经久不衰，是幸存的木精灵的避难所，他们坚守着，希望有奇迹发生。感觉到梅洛拉和科瑞隆的祝福使这片森林的心脏得以存活，直到大火烧尽，精灵们开始在古老的树木和丛林中建造一个新的家园。",
	"This region became the Veluthil Forest, and from this verdant sanctuary, the elves would build the stunningly beautiful city of Molaesmyr. From the surrounding ashes, the fey magics of Veluthil brought forth new life and leaf, expanding the boundaries of the forest over centuries to eventually reclaim much of the Wildlands. Druidic forces and powerful fey enchantments were laid throughout the twisting paths of the forest to protect the elves of Molaesmyr as they expanded their towering city, the central trees reaching magically enhanced heights as homes and halls extended high into the boughs. The elven city stood as the height of reborn civilization on Wildemount.": "这个地区成为了维鲁蒂尔森林，在这个青翠的庇护所中，精灵们建立了令人惊叹的美丽城市--莫拉伊斯米尔。从周围的灰烬中，维鲁斯尔的精灵魔法带来了新的生命和树叶，在几个世纪里扩大了森林的边界，最终收回了大部分荒地。德鲁伊的力量和强大的费伊魔法遍布森林的曲折小路，以保护莫莱斯米尔的精灵们，因为他们正在扩建他们高耸的城市，中心的树木达到了神奇的高度，房屋和大厅延伸到高高的树枝上。这座精灵城市是野人山重生文明的高峰。",
	"It is still unclear what triggered the event. Whether some knowledge-hungry researcher or arrogant sorcerer was delving in forgotten vaults between the planes, or some terrible power lying dormant beneath the forest was awakened, the source of the corruption is unknown. What is known is that in the year 585 PD, suddenly and without warning, a wave of purple-gray shadow rapidly crept from the center of Molaesmyr to engulf the entire city.": "目前还不清楚是什么触发了这一事件。不管是一些渴望知识的研究者还是傲慢的巫师在各位面之间钻研被遗忘的地窖，还是一些沉睡在森林下的可怕力量被唤醒，腐败的来源都是未知的。人们知道的是，在公元585年，突然间，在没有任何警告的情况下，一波紫灰色的阴影迅速从莫莱斯米尔的中心爬升，吞噬了整个城市。",
	"Many elves choked and died on toxic fumes, while others were twisted and driven mad, transforming into terrifying fey abominations. Trees bent and warped, leaves withered and turned a sickly purple, and strange, unknown bramble growths reclaimed the forest floor. This corruption slowly spread throughout the entire Veluthil Forest, decimating the home of the elves. Some survivors fled as fast as they could to the northwest, across the Frigid Depths, eventually settling the township of Bysaes Tyl in the Pearlbow Wilderness. Others escaped to the northeast, seeking refuge in the Flotket Alps, freezing in the snowy mountains until they stumbled on the dwarves of Uthodurn.": "许多精灵被有毒烟雾呛死，而其他精灵则被扭曲和逼疯，变成了可怕的精灵怪兽。树木弯曲变形，树叶枯萎，变成病态的紫色，奇怪的、未知的荆棘生长在森林的地面上。这种腐败慢慢地蔓延到整个维鲁斯尔森林，毁灭了精灵的家园。一些幸存者以最快的速度逃往西北方，穿越冰冷的深渊，最终在珍珠弓荒野的比塞斯-泰尔镇定居下来。其他人则逃往东北方，在弗洛特阿尔卑斯山寻求庇护，在雪山上受冻，直到他们偶然发现了乌索德恩的矮人。",
	"Taking pity on the survivors, the dwarves took in the elven refugees and offered them a home. This act of kindness changed the course of Uthodurn's history, eventually forming a unique union of dwarven and elven culture that has endured for nearly three centuries. Craftsmanship within Uthodurn is second to none, but nothing is traded beyond the borders of the city, aside from the odd stolen artifact. Small excavation parties are often sent to the corrupted Veluthil Forest—now called the Savalirwood—to search the ruins of Molaesmyr, attempting to piece together what caused the corruption and determine if the forest can be recovered.": "矮人怜悯幸存者，收留了精灵难民，为他们提供了一个家。这一善举改变了乌索杜恩的历史进程，最终形成了矮人和精灵文化的独特结合，并持续了近三个世纪之久。Uthodurn的手工艺是首屈一指的，但除了零星的被盗文物外，没有任何东西能在城市的边界之外进行交易。小型挖掘队经常被派往腐败的维鲁蒂尔森林--现在被称为萨瓦里尔森林--搜索莫拉伊斯米尔的废墟，试图拼凑出导致腐败的原因，并确定森林是否可以恢复。",
	"Unfortunately, a township of criminals and outlaws has sprung up on the southern edge of the Savalirwood, just beyond the Dwendalian Empire. In addition to the dangerous denizens of this wretched thicket, which is known as Shadycreek Run, there are numerous raiders and thieves seeking relics from the ruins of the forest, escalating conflict throughout the region.": "不幸的是，在萨瓦利林的南部边缘，就在德文达利安帝国之外，出现了一个罪犯和不法分子的乡镇。除了这个被称为Shadycreek Run的可恶灌木丛中的危险居民外，还有许多从森林废墟中寻找遗物的袭击者和盗贼，使整个地区的冲突升级。",
	"The once thickly forested landscape of Xhorhas was the site of the final battleground of the Calamity. It was subjugated to such intense destruction at the hands of the warring gods that when the dust of the Divergence cleared, Eastern Wynandir was naught but a cracked, ashen wasteland. Ghor Dranas, the citadel of the Betrayer Gods, lay broken, cursed, and abandoned, while lingering demons and monstrosities fled to the surrounding jagged cliffs and blackened marshlands. Discarded abominations seeped from beneath the ruined earth of Xhorhas's eastern shores, climbing past the Penumbra Range where the forgotten creations of the Betrayers were locked away.": "Xhorhas曾经是森林茂密的地方，是灾变的最后战场。它在交战的诸神手中受到了如此强烈的破坏，以至于当分歧的尘埃散去时，东怀恩迪尔只剩下一片龟裂的灰烬荒地。戈尔-德拉纳斯，背叛者之神的堡垒，躺在破碎的、被诅咒的和被遗弃的地方，而残存的恶魔和怪兽则逃到了周围的锯齿状悬崖和发黑的沼泽地。被丢弃的憎恶从霍哈斯东岸的废墟下渗出，爬过了被遗忘的背叛者的创造物被锁起来的潘恩布拉山脉。",
	"Throughout this wasteland, scattered bands of aimless men, beasts, and goblinkin battled for shelter and sustenance. These tribes were confined to their desolate home by the Ki'Nau leviathan who guarded the waters past the southern shores and the surviving dwarves of Grimgolir, who prevented any Xhorhasians from moving farther west. The nomadic, warring clans fought against the harsh conditions of the valley for centuries, only able to develop small bastions of civilization within the harsh wilderness.": "在这片荒地上，分散的无目的的人、野兽和Goblinkin的队伍为了避难和维持生计而战斗着。这些部落被守卫着南岸水域的Ki'Nau利维坦和幸存的Grimgolir矮人限制在他们荒凉的家园里，他们阻止任何Xhorhasians向更远的地方移动。游牧的、交战的部族与山谷的严酷条件斗争了几个世纪，只能在严酷的荒野中发展出小型的文明堡垒。",
	"Beneath the ruins of Ghor Dranas, a group of scavenging drow turned from Lolth, their primary deity for centuries, finding renewed faith in an esoteric entity they called the Luxon. Guided by the light of their new deity, the drow survived their ascent from deep within the Underdark and reclaimed the halls of Ghor Dranas for themselves, naming their new home Rosohna, or \"Rebirth.\" The leading house of Kryn helped build a new nation of dark elves who sought the surface as part of their worship, and slowly began to reach out to the nearby nomads to unite under the light of the Luxon.": "在Ghor Dranas的废墟下，一群拾荒的乌鸦放弃了他们几个世纪以来的主要神灵Lolth，重新找到了对一个神秘实体的信仰，他们称之为Luxon。在新神灵之光的指引下，这些乌鸦从暗黑深处幸存下来，并为自己夺回了戈尔-德拉纳斯的大厅，将他们的新家命名为Rosohna，或 \"重生\"。克林的领导家族帮助建立了一个由黑暗精灵组成的新国家，他们把寻找地表作为他们崇拜的一部分，并慢慢开始接触附近的游牧民族，在卢克松的光芒下团结起来。",
	"As the first nation of post-Calamity Xhorhas, the Kryn Dynasty worked to expand its reach throughout the wasteland and bring unity to the ravaging hordes. Dormant evils continued to rise from beneath the marshes and badlands of Xhorhas, spreading chaos and battling with the warriors who called the desolate valley their home. The struggle to convert the denizens of Eastern Wynandir to the light of the Luxon continues to this day, while the agents of Lolth seek to spite and destroy her once-chosen for their arrogance.": "作为后迦勒底时代Xhorhas的第一个国家，Kryn王朝努力在整个荒原上扩大其影响力，并为肆虐的群魔带来团结。沉睡的邪恶继续从Xhorhas的沼泽地和坏境下升起，散布混乱，并与那些把荒凉的山谷当作自己家的勇士们进行斗争。让东威南迪尔的居民皈依卢克逊之光的斗争一直持续到今天，而洛尔思的代理人则因为他们的傲慢而试图报复和摧毁她曾经的选民。",
	"Meanwhile, the dragonborn have begun to reach out to Exandria's sprawling political world, wishing to exchange knowledge and trade their gold and jewels for powerful magics to better their standing.": "与此同时，龙族已经开始向埃克桑德里亚庞大的政治世界伸出援手，希望交换知识，用他们的黄金和珠宝换取强大的魔法，以提高他们的地位。",
	"After the Calamity, a shard of the destroyed dragonkin city of Kethesk came to rest within the southern Dreemoth Ravine. The surviving dragonborn took advantage of the ravine's defensible layout to build a new city and made an alliance with the cave-dwelling, indigenous dragonborn they called ravenites, beginning the reformation of civilized dragonborn society.": "灾难过后，被摧毁的龙人城市凯瑟斯克（Kethesk）的碎片在南部的德雷莫斯峡谷（Dreemoth Ravine）安家落户。幸存的龙人利用峡谷可防御的布局建造了一座新的城市，并与居住在洞穴中的土著龙人结成联盟，他们称之为乌鸦人，开始了文明龙人社会的改革。",
	"With the ravenites as a labor force, the dragonborn harvested the massive brumestone crystals that had once held their city aloft, and the new city of Draconia began to take shape as a series of floating islands within the heart of the chasm. Calling themselves draconbloods, they spent hundreds of years slowly reconstructing their nation in seclusion, focusing entirely on their own enlightenment and pursuits. They eventually enslaved the ravenites to mine the ravine's gold and gemstones, and to ensure draconblood dominance in the region, leaving their minds free to focus on internal politics and arcane advancement.": "有了乌鸦人作为劳动力，龙裔收获了曾经支撑他们的城市的巨大的青石水晶，新的德拉科尼亚城开始成形，成为鸿沟中心地带的一系列浮动岛屿。他们自称为龙血人，花了数百年时间在隐居中慢慢重建自己的国家，完全专注于自己的启蒙和追求。他们最终奴役了乌鸦人，以开采峡谷中的黄金和宝石，并确保龙血人在该地区的主导地位，使他们的思想能够自由地专注于内部政治和奥术的发展。",
	"In the year 815 PD, an unexpected assault on Draconia came in the form of a group of ancient chromatic dragons calling themselves the Chroma Conclave. The mighty city of Draconia was immediately destroyed and left to crumble in the Dreemoth Ravine. A powerful white dragon called Vorugal, the Frigid Doom, claimed the ravine as its new domain, while the rest of the dragons sought conquest elsewhere in Exandria. These events shook the nations of Wildemount, sending the Clovis Concord and the Dwendalian Empire into a state of alert, while the Kryn Dynasty temporarily withdrew to Rosohna, fearing another attack.": "公元815年，一群自称 \"卓玛协约 \"的古老色龙对德拉科尼亚发起了意想不到的攻击。强大的德拉科尼亚城立即被摧毁，并被丢在德雷莫斯峡谷中。一头强大的白龙叫沃鲁加尔（Vorugal），冰冷的厄运，宣称该峡谷是它的新领域，而其余的龙则在艾克桑德里亚的其他地方寻求征服。这些事件震撼了怀德蒙的各个国家，使克洛维斯协约和德文达利亚帝国进入了警戒状态，而克莱恩王朝则因担心再次受到攻击而暂时撤退到罗索纳。",
	"As time passed, Vorugal and the entire Chroma Conclave were slain and the danger seemed to have dissipated. With Draconia sundered, the no-longer enslaved ravenites greatly outnumbered their previous masters; they claimed their freedom and punished the surviving draconbloods. A handful of draconian nobles fled to the Menagerie Coast or the Dwendalian Empire to seek asylum, leaving the ravenites to rebuild Wildemount dragonborn society on the ruins of their oppressors.": "随着时间的推移，沃鲁加尔和整个卓玛协约国被杀，危险似乎已经消散了。随着德拉科尼亚的分裂，不再被奴役的乌鸦人在数量上大大超过了他们以前的主人；他们要求自由并惩罚幸存的龙人血统。少数的龙人贵族逃到美纳吉海岸或德文达利亚帝国寻求庇护，留下乌鸦人在压迫者的废墟上重建怀德蒙龙人社会。",

Small skirmishes and slain soldiers on both sides deter expansion beyond the Ashkeeper Peaks, with each faction keeping a close eye on the other.": "在过去的一个世纪里，德文达利安帝国与克里恩王朝发生了冲突。双方的小规模冲突和被杀的士兵阻止了向阿什肯峰以外的地区扩张，每个派别都在密切关注着对方。",
	"Recently, the empire's interest in growing Kryn influence has led to increasing curiosity about the source of the Kryn's mysterious arcane capabilities. Dwendalian spies successfully stole two of four artifacts known as \"{@item luxon beacon|egw|beacons},\" which seemed to be powerful sources of the unique magical energy called dunamis. The Bright Queen Leylas Kryn began an initiative steal back the beacons and assault Dwendalian strongholds until these sacred relics are returned. Now, in 835 PD, the resulting skirmishes have escalated into all-out war. A fifth beacon has been recently uncovered by the Cerberus Assembly, and the violence threatens to grow past the Ashkeeper Peaks and embroil other denizens of Wildemount in the conflict.": "最近，帝国对克里恩日益增长的影响力的兴趣，使得人们对克里恩人神秘的奥术能力的来源越来越好奇。德文达尔的间谍成功地偷走了四个被称为\"{@item luxon beacon|egw|beacons} \"的神器中的两个，它们似乎是被称为dunamis的独特魔法能量的强大来源。光明女王Leylas Kryn开始倡议偷回信标，并攻击Dwendalian的据点，直到这些神圣的遗物被归还。现在，在公元835年，由此产生的小规模冲突已经升级为全面战争。地狱犬议会最近发现了第五个信标，而暴力事件有可能发展到超过阿什守卫者山峰，并将荒野山的其他居民卷入冲突。",
	"The Divine Gate, established during the Divergence, is a powerful barrier between the Material Plane and the divine realms. The Divine Gate sealed away both the Betrayer Gods and the Prime Deities within their respective domains in hopes of salvaging the new age and preventing another Calamity. If the Divine Gate were to be destroyed by the unanimous effort of the Prime Deities, all powers would be unleashed, threatening armageddon. Thus, the gods patiently watch their creations from beyond the veil, lending what small power they can send through the gate to aid the goals of their faithful.

Fiercely nationalistic and proud of his heritage, the king harbors a disdain for outsiders and their challenges to imperial rule; he often has emissaries thrown from the borders or imprisoned until a replacement is sent to barter for their release. Bertrand does genuinely wish to protect the lives of his people and be remembered as the best of his bloodline. However, civil unrest is brewing, and his frustrations with the Cerberus Assembly only intensify his forceful demeanor.

Hoping to watch her eat her words and collapse under the pressure of imperial politics, the Crown offered her chief management over all agriculture in the position of Argonomist.

	"The Kryn Dynasty rules the northern wastes of Xhorhas, and has only revealed itself to the wider world within the past century. Centered around—and under—the ruins of Ghor Dranas in Eastern Wynandir, the dynasty governs many townships and small villages where the Kryn have helped establish a modicum of civilized living among the nomadic wastefolk. They believe that beings not yet beyond redemption can be turned to the light of the Luxon, and often struggle with the unruly denizens of the wastes, hoping to gain converts to their cause and faith. Those that do accept the dynasty often do so because they seek protection from the dregs of the Calamity that wander the wastes, as well as the scouts of the Dwendalian Empire.": "克林王朝统治着Xhorhas的北部荒原，并在过去的一个世纪里才向更广泛的世界展示自己。该王朝以东维南迪尔的戈尔-德拉纳斯废墟为中心，并在废墟下统治着许多乡镇和小村庄，克莱恩在那里帮助游牧民族建立了适度的文明生活。他们相信尚未被救赎的生命可以转向卢克松的光芒，并经常与荒原上不守规矩的居民进行斗争，希望获得对其事业和信仰的皈依。那些接受王朝的人往往是因为他们寻求保护，以抵御游荡在荒原上的灾星渣滓，以及德文达尔帝国的侦察兵。",
	"Dark elves are the most populous race within the Kryn Dynasty. The drow were the first people to uncover the first buried Luxon beacon many ages ago, in a time before they turned from Lolth and escaped enslavement from the Betrayer Gods. The dark elves claimed the dread citadel of Ghor Dranas as their own, as well as the massive network of underground caverns that make up the Underdark of Wildemount. The Kryn are stealthily becoming a force to be reckoned with.": "黑暗精灵是克里恩王朝中人口最多的种族。乌鸦是许多年前第一个发现第一个被埋葬的卢克松信标的人，那时候他们还没有脱离洛尔思，也没有逃出背叛者之神的奴役。黑暗精灵宣称戈尔-德拉纳斯的可怕堡垒是他们自己的，还有构成怀德蒙地下世界的巨大地下洞穴网络。克林人正悄悄地成为一支不可忽视的力量。",
	"The Kryn drow who emerged from the shadowed depths of the caverns beneath Xhorhas now endure periods of sunlight as part of their worship, though their cities are shaded by umbral magic during daylight hours. When hunting, or in times of conflict, the warriors of the Kryn don their signature chitinous armor. A series of small airways woven through this armor can be opened to emit a loud, clicking buzz to intimidate their foes as they charge. This noise has inspired outsiders to call the Kryn \"cricks,\" referring to this cricket-like din.": "从Xhorhas地下洞穴的阴影深处走出来的克莱恩鸦人现在忍受着阳光的照射，这也是他们崇拜的一部分，尽管他们的城市在白天的时候被乌黑的魔法所遮蔽。在狩猎时，或在冲突时期，克莱恩的战士们会穿上他们标志性的几丁质盔甲。一系列编织在盔甲上的小气道可以被打开，发出响亮的、咔嚓咔嚓的嗡嗡声，以恐吓他们冲锋时的敌人。这种声音使外人将克里恩人称为 \"蟋蟀\"，指的是这种类似蟋蟀的喧嚣。",
	"Artifacts left behind by the Luxon that hold its essence are known as Luxon beacons and are coveted by the Kryn Dynasty as central to their civilization. If a proven soul is ritualistically bound to a Luxon beacon, they can enter a process called the consecution: when a mortal bound to the Luxon dies within a hundred miles of a beacon, the beacon ensnares their soul from its intended afterlife and prepares it to be reborn in a new child within that same vicinity. When that child then matures into adolescence, they begin to recall subtle knowledge from their past life's experiences, a process called anamnesis. Through meditation with a guide, they can unlock the memories of their past lives and become a more complete being. When a soul has cycled enough to believe they are ready to greet the Luxon, they are called an Umavi, or \"perfect soul,\" and are revered within the Kryn society. Some beings that naturally reincarnate, such as the phoenix, are considered holy creatures that carry a shard of the Luxon within themselves.": "卢克逊留下的拥有其精髓的文物被称为卢克逊信标，被克莱恩王朝视为其文明的核心而觊觎。如果一个被证实的灵魂在仪式上被束缚在卢克逊信标上，他们可以进入一个被称为迫害的过程：当一个被卢克逊束缚的凡人在信标100英里范围内死亡时，信标将他们的灵魂从预定的来世中捕获，并准备在同一附近的一个新孩子中重生。当这个孩子进入青春期后，他们开始回忆过去生活经历中的微妙知识，这个过程被称为失忆。通过与向导的冥想，他们可以解开前世的记忆，成为一个更完整的生命。当一个灵魂已经循环了足够的时间，相信他们已经准备好迎接卢克松，他们被称为Umavi，或 \"完美的灵魂\"，并在克里恩社会中受到尊敬。一些自然轮回的生命，如凤凰，被认为是圣洁的生物，它们自身带有卢克逊的碎片。",
	"If a life continues long enough to achieve a state of clarity called achess, where they believe that they've learned all they can learn from their current life, they can choose to partake in a ritualistic termination of their current life, assisted by an Umavi in proximity to a beacon, thereby setting them on the path to a new birth. While considered an honor within the Kryn Dynasty, this practice is misunderstood and seen as barbaric outside their culture.": "如果一个人的生命持续了足够长的时间，达到了一种被称为achess的清晰状态，他们认为自己已经从当前的生命中学到了所有能学到的东西，他们可以选择参加一个终止当前生命的仪式，由Umavi在一个灯塔附近协助，从而使他们走上新生的道路。虽然在克莱恩王朝内部被认为是一种荣誉，但这种做法在他们的文化之外被误解并被视为野蛮的行为。",
	"The Kryn Dynasty is a society restructured from the Lolthite history they rejected. The people of the dynasty stand under the first Umavi, known as Bright Queen Leylas Kryn. Beneath the first Umavi, there are twelve noble Dens that mark families of souls who have lived together through generations: Dens Kryn, Mirimm, Thelyss, Hythenos, Icozrin, Biylan, Tasithar, Duendalos, Daev'yana, Omrifar, Beltune, and Zolaed. When someone is believed to be experiencing anamnesis, they submit to a deep meditation with a guide trained in the ways of consecution. This process helps restore memories of the past life, which then mingle with current memories.": "克林王朝是一个从他们拒绝的洛尔塞特历史中重组的社会。该王朝的人民站在第一任Umavi之下，被称为光明女王Leylas Kryn。在第一任Umavi之下，有12个高贵的Dens，标志着世代生活在一起的灵魂家族。Kryn、Mirimm、Thelyss、Hythenos、Icozrin、Biylan、Tasithar、Duendalos、Daev'yana、Omrifar、Beltune和Zolaed。当有人被认为正在经历失忆症时，他们会在受过迫害方式训练的引导下进行深度冥想。这个过程有助于恢复前世的记忆，然后与当前的记忆混合在一起。",
	"The awakened soul is then reunited with their Den. Dens do grow as new souls enter the consecution and join their ranks, and new Dens are established with each generation. The oldest Dens, especially those helmed by an Umavi, are held in the highest esteem, and generally answer directly to the Bright Queen. The older the soul, the more prestige it holds in the dynasty. Beneath the Dens of Rosohna, guilds and Den representatives govern the other cities of the dynasty that stretch across Xhorhas, spreading the faith of the Luxon and watching over all Xhorhasians who seek the safety of civilization.": "觉醒的灵魂随后与他们的巢穴团聚。随着新的灵魂进入迫害并加入他们的行列，巢穴确实在成长，而且每一代都会建立新的巢穴。最古老的巢穴，尤其是那些由Umavi掌舵的巢穴，受到最高的尊重，通常直接向光明女王负责。灵魂越老，它在王朝中的威望就越高。在Rosohna神殿之下，行会和神殿代表管理着王朝的其他城市，这些城市遍布Xhorhas，传播着Luxon的信仰，并监视着所有寻求文明安全的Xhorhas人。",
	"This seemingly benevolent societal structure does have a dark side. A closely guarded secret of the highest Umavi is a challenge in the consecution called typhros: some souls that have undergone multiple cycles of the consecution are driven mad when their minds cannot reconcile the memories of many lifetimes. Those who fall to typhros are quietly removed from the dynasty and either left in the wastes or mercifully slain away from the beacons. Signs of madness are beginning to show in the Bright Queen herself, but those closest to her do all they can to shield others from such portents.": "这种看似仁慈的社会结构确实有其黑暗的一面。最高Umavi的一个严密的秘密是被称为typhros的迫害中的一个挑战：一些经历了多个迫害周期的灵魂被逼疯了，因为他们的大脑无法调和多世的记忆。那些被逼疯的人被悄悄地从王朝中移出，要么被留在荒野中，要么被仁慈地杀死在远离灯塔的地方。疯癫的迹象开始在光明女王本人身上显现，但那些与她最亲近的人尽其所能地保护其他人免受这种预兆的影响。",
	"It is believed that the Luxon cherishes unity in community, but also values free choice and the power of the individual mind. For each soul to carve a unique path is the best way for a soul to learn about the world. Casting off the teachings of Fate and Destiny taught by some of the current pantheon, the followers of the Luxon are taught that the real power of the universe comes from the power of choice. Many possible futures all await your path, and the universe trembles with anticipatory power as you approach every decision. This power is called dunamis, the energy of potentiality, and the coalescing architecture of the multiple futures leading into each moment is released when an outcome is brought to reality. It is the energy that suffuses every Luxon beacon to prepare the lives to come, and it is the basis of the Kryn's unique divine crafts and arcane abilities.": "人们认为，卢克逊人珍视社区的团结，但也重视自由选择和个人心灵的力量。对于每个灵魂来说，开辟一条独特的道路是一个灵魂了解世界的最好方式。卢克逊的追随者摒弃了当前一些万神殿所传授的命运教义，他们被告知，宇宙的真正力量来自于选择的力量。许多可能的未来都在等待着你的道路，当你接近每一个决定时，宇宙都在颤抖着期待的力量。这种力量被称为dunamis，是潜在的能量，当一个结果被带到现实中时，导致每个时刻的多种未来的凝聚架构被释放出来。它是充斥于每一个卢克松灯塔的能量，为即将到来的生活做准备，也是克莱恩人独特的神术和奥秘能力的基础。",
	"The Kryn Dynasty has uncovered four beacons and is certain that more remain to be discovered. It is believed that once all the beacons are brought together, the Luxon will be summoned from their slumber to ask their children the great question and impart the truth. It is said that at this time, the Luxon will take those who entered the consecution and abandon this lesser world to start a new world elsewhere.": "克林王朝已经发现了四个信标，并确信还有更多的信标有待发现。人们相信，一旦所有的信标被汇集在一起，卢克逊人将从沉睡中被召唤出来，向他们的孩子们提出伟大的问题并传授真理。据说在这个时候，卢克逊人将带着那些进入迫害的人，放弃这个较小的世界，在其他地方开始一个新的世界。",
	"The Aurora Watch legionnaires of the Kryn currently number around 21,600 in total. Around 13,200 Aurora Watch are divided among the cities under the dynasty's protection, with another 3,300 Aurora Watch stationed in and around the capital of Rosohna—formerly known as Ghor Dranas—to keep the peace and defend the region. Approximately 5,100 soldiers are scattered throughout the Underdark beneath Wildemount at different locations of interest, many employing magically controlled purple worms to allow elite units to navigate the caverns quickly. The remainder of the watch is stationed along the border of Western Wynandir to prevent the empire's incursions—and to seize land from the empire as they advance.": "克林王朝的极光守卫军团目前共有约21,600人。大约13200名极光守卫被分配到王朝保护下的各个城市，另有3300名极光守卫驻扎在首都罗索纳--以前被称为戈尔-德拉纳斯--及其周围，以维持和平并保卫该地区。大约有5100名士兵分散在荒野山下的暗黑世界的不同位置，许多人采用了魔法控制的紫色蠕虫，使精英部队能够快速地在洞穴中穿梭。其余的守望者则驻扎在西怀恩迪尔的边境，以防止帝国的入侵--并在帝国推进时夺取土地。",
	"The primary objective of the Kryn Dynasty is to seek out and recover the Luxon beacons presumed to be scattered across Exandria. Not only does each beacon bring them closer to the eventual rebirth of the Luxon, they also help broaden the boundaries of the Kryn society as a new center of the consecution, allowing expansion into new lands and the continued conversion of others. With two of their four beacons now missing, the Bright Queen and her people are desperate to discover more of these sacred artifacts.": "克林王朝的主要目标是寻找和恢复被认为散落在埃克桑德里亚的卢克逊信标。每一个信标不仅使他们更接近卢克逊人的最终重生，而且还有助于扩大克莱恩社会的边界，使其成为新的迫害中心，允许向新的土地扩张，并继续改变其他人的生活。现在他们的四个信标中的两个已经失踪，光明女王和她的人民急切地想发现更多的这些神圣的文物。",
	"The Bright Queen and her fellow Umavi see the strength dormant in the roving beastfolk and goblinoids of Xhorhas, and have taken to teaching these nomadic peoples their ways, helping them build villages under the banner of the dynasty, and converting them to their faith. Even so, not all ruling Dens like the idea of introducing what they consider lesser creatures into the consecution, leading to tensions between the people of Rosohna and the scattered villages in the Xhorhasian wilds.": "明亮的女王和她的同伴Umavi看到了休眠在Xhorhas的流浪兽人和地精中的力量，并采取了教这些游牧民族的方式，帮助他们在王朝的旗帜下建立村庄，并使他们皈依他们的信仰。即便如此，并不是所有的统治者都喜欢把他们认为较低级的生物引入迫害的想法，这导致了罗索纳人与霍哈斯荒野中分散的村庄之间的紧张关系。",
	"With some beacons stolen by operatives of the Dwendalian Empire, the entire Kryn Dynasty has mobilized to retaliate. They are gathering armies to assault Western Wynandir while sending assassins and spies through the subterranean paths of the Underdark, hoping to recover the beacons and simultaneously weaken the evil and blasphemous empire.": "随着一些信标被德温达里亚帝国的特工偷走，整个克莱恩王朝已经动员起来进行报复。他们正在集结军队进攻西维南迪尔，同时派遣刺客和间谍穿越地下城的地下通道，希望能找回信标，同时削弱这个邪恶而亵渎的帝国。",
	"The Kryn Dynasty has spent a generation training and preparing a select group of volunteers to gather information on their enemies and find routes through both political and physical borders. These agents are collectively known as the Lens, a network of spies and infiltrators who can bypass boundaries and assimilate into foreign nations to gather intelligence, help the Bright Queen protect their people, and seek out beacons across Exandria.": "克林王朝花了一代人的时间来训练和准备一批经过挑选的志愿者，以收集关于他们敌人的信息，并找到穿越政治和物理边界的路线。这些特工被统称为Lens，这是一个由间谍和潜入者组成的网络，他们可以绕过边界，同化到外国去收集情报，帮助光明女王保护他们的人民，并在整个艾克桑德里亚寻找信标。",
	"Open war has recently broken out between the Kryn Dynasty and the Dwendalian Empire—a conflict that neither nation can afford to lose. Those bearing the colors of the enemy are subdued and questioned before being punished and sometimes executed. Judgment is swift against the perceived imperial oppressors, and the forces of Rosohna will continue to push until their foes yield the stolen relics.": "克林王朝和德文达尔帝国之间最近爆发了公开的战争--这是一场任何一个国家都输不起的冲突。那些带有敌人颜色的人在受到惩罚，有时甚至被处决之前，都会被制服和审问。对被认为是帝国压迫者的审判是迅速的，罗索纳的部队将继续推进，直到他们的敌人交出被盗的遗物。",
	"Though the Kryn have remained fairly isolated throughout their history, they are now reaching out to other factions in the hopes of making alliances against the Dwendalian Empire. The Kryn Dynasty has begun hiring mercenaries through the Tribes of Shadycreek Run and purchasing dangerous weapons of war from the Myriad. Rumors of strange magics and powerful relics in northern Eiselcross have reached the dynasty's ears, and they are willing to seek out any potential advantage over their Dwendalian foes.": "虽然克莱恩家族在历史上一直保持着相当的孤立，但他们现在正与其他派别接触，希望能与德文达尔帝国结成联盟。克林王朝已经开始通过沙迪克里克之路部落雇佣雇佣兵，并从迈瑞德购买危险的战争武器。关于艾瑟克罗斯北部的奇怪魔法和强大遗迹的传闻已经传到了王朝的耳朵里，他们愿意寻找任何比德文达尔人敌人更多的潜在优势。",
	"There are many humanoid tribes that roam the southern reaches of Xhorhas that have declined to ally themselves with the Kryn—or to be assimilated by them. While the Bright Queen has allowed them to continue their neutrality for the time being, she watches them closely, lest they be courted by the empire's coin and empty promises.": "有许多游荡在Xhorhas南部的类人部落拒绝与克里恩结盟，或者被他们同化。虽然光明女王允许他们暂时继续保持中立，但她密切关注着他们，以免他们被帝国的钱币和空头承诺所吸引。",
	"Within the sight of the Luxon, the Umavi, and the Dens who protect the lands of Xhorhas and its people, any who are presented for judgement before the presiding officials entrusted with the wisdom of the Bright Queen are to have their sentence carried our accordingly.

All fines and punishments regarding crimes against a Den official or member of the Bright Queen's council are tripled.": "在Luxon、Umavi和保护Xhorhas土地及其人民的Dens的视线范围内，任何被提交到受托于光明女王的智慧的主持官员面前进行审判的人都将被相应地执行判决。所有针对曙光之神士兵或贵族的犯罪的罚款和惩罚都是双倍的。所有针对Den官员或光明女王议会成员的罪行的罚款和惩罚都是三倍。",

She built the dynasty around her journey, spearheaded the recovery of the four beacons known to the Kryn, and died numerous times in the defense of her people. Leylas Kryn is deeply revered and respected as a mighty warrior, an empathic leader, and the elder Umavi who guides her people in the light of the Luxon. Her behavior has grown erratic at times, worrying her trusted inner circle, but she is far too driven to acknowledge such weakness in a time of war.": "一千年前第一座信标被发现时，莱伊拉斯就在现场，此后的八辈子都在进行激烈的斗争和自我探索。她围绕着她的旅程建立了王朝，带头恢复了克莱恩人已知的四个信标，并无数次为保卫她的人民而牺牲。Leylas Kryn作为一个强大的战士，一个有同情心的领导者，以及在Luxon之光中引导她的人民的长老Umavi，受到了深深的敬仰和尊重。她的行为有时变得不稳定，让她信任的内部圈子感到担忧，但在战争时期，她太有动力了，不会承认这种弱点。",
	"An extremely powerful echo knight and general of the forces of Rosohna, Quana has been Leylas's partner for three of her lifetimes, and five of Leylas's. She is wholly devoted to her people—and her queen. Quana holds a private hope that the Kryn might one day leave the inhospitable wastes of Xhorhas and find a proper place in the world among the other peoples of Exandria. The Bright Queen was once receptive to her ideas, but Leylas Kryn has no time for idealism in this age of war. Quana is disappointed, but she is more worried by the strange shifts in her partner's usually wise and controlled demeanor.": "夸纳是一位极其强大的回声骑士和罗索纳部队的将军，她在莱伊拉斯的三生中一直是他的伙伴，在莱伊拉斯的五生中也是如此。她完全献身于她的人民和她的女王。夸娜私下里希望克莱恩人有一天能离开荒凉的霍哈斯荒原，在艾克桑德里亚的其他民族中找到一个合适的位置。光明女王曾经接受过她的想法，但在这个战争年代，莱拉斯-克莱恩没有时间接受理想主义。夸娜很失望，但她更担心的是她的伙伴平时睿智而有节制的举止中的奇怪转变。",
	"Just over a hundred and twenty years old and still within his first life, Essek is a prodigy who displays an unprecedented talent for the manipulation of dunamis energy. Essek is both respected and feared for his intelligence and cunning, and he carefully plots each step he takes to further his and his Den's climb up the hierarchy of the dynasty. Essek is more interested in dunamancy magic than worshiping the Luxon, and he is strangely excited for the war with the empire. He is eager to use the conflict as an excuse to practice the deadlier aspects of dunamancy, and also curious to see what the powerful minds of the Cerberus Assembly may have gleaned from their research into the beacon they stole.": "埃塞克刚过一百二十岁，还在他的第一次生命中，他是一个神童，在操纵杜纳米斯能量方面表现出前所未有的天赋。埃塞克因其智慧和狡猾而受到尊重和敬畏，他精心策划了每一个步骤，以进一步推动他和他的丹尼尔在王朝的等级制度中攀升。与崇拜卢克松相比，埃塞克对杜纳姆魔法更感兴趣，而且他对与帝国的战争感到奇怪的兴奋。他渴望以这场冲突为借口，练习更致命的黑魔法，同时也好奇地想看看地狱犬议会的强者们从他们偷来的信标的研究中可能收集到了什么。",
	"Having lived a number of lifetimes as an early follower of Leylas, Olomon has settled into this recent life as a massive minotaur, embracing the abilities granted to him on the battlefield and taking his place as a champion on the front lines.

	"Seen by many within the dynasty as a talented diviner and voice of reason, Abrianna is an Umavi nearly as old as the Bright Queen herself. The beloved Skysybil has spent her current lifetime as a goblin, a fact that has drawn both ire and jests from the Bright Queen's court for decades. This experience has given Abrianna a new perspective on the wastefolk under the dynasty's banner; she is now one of the few councilors in the Lucid Bastion who bother to vouch for the goblinkin.": "在王朝内部，许多人认为她是一个有天赋的占卜师和理性的声音，阿布瑞娜是一个几乎和光明女王本人一样古老的Umavi。这位受人爱戴的斯凯西比尔在她目前的一生中都是作为妖精度过的，这一事实几十年来一直招致光明女王宫廷的愤怒和嘲笑。这段经历让阿布瑞娜对王朝旗下的废物有了新的看法；她现在是琉璃堡垒中少数几个费心为妖精担保的议员之一。",

	"The Cerberus Assembly was established nearly three hundred years ago, when strife and competition between warring mage lords threatened to unravel the social order of the Dwendalian Empire. The house leaders of this conflict nearly destroyed one another in what was called the Eve of Crimson Midnight, an arcane battle within the capital of Rexxentrum that leveled two wards of the city, killing hundreds of civilians. At the peak of the violence, a parlay was called, and the mage lords decided to put aside their differences and avoid mutually assured destruction, instead joining as a unified conclave. When brought before the king for judgment of their crimes, they offered an accord to instead officially instate the conclave and submit entirely to king's rule. Taking the name the Cerberus Assembly, a reference to a powerful, historical union of mages during the Age of Arcanum, the mages took the empire to new heights of power and expansion.": "地狱犬议会成立于近三百年前，当时交战的法师领主之间的纷争和竞争威胁到了德文达利亚帝国的社会秩序。在这场被称为 \"深红午夜前夕 \"的冲突中，家族领袖们几乎互相毁灭，一场在首都雷克森特鲁姆发生的奥术战斗夷平了城市的两个区，杀死了数百名平民。在暴力事件的顶峰，人们召集了一次谈判，法师领主们决定搁置他们的分歧，避免相互毁灭，而是作为一个统一的协约国加入。当被带到国王面前审判他们的罪行时，他们提出了一个协议，即正式成立协约组织，并完全服从国王的统治。法师们以 \"地狱之神大会 \"为名，参考了历史上阿卡努姆时代的一个强大的法师联盟，将帝国的权力和扩张推向了新的高度。",
	"In the centuries since, the Cerberus Assembly has subtly ingrained itself within most facets of the empire's government, becoming a force of political and military power that many say could rival the king himself. This reality is not lost on the royal council, and tensions often simmer between the assembly and the Crown. The mages of the assembly are known for their extravagant lifestyles and intimidating history of political and economic control, and much of the populace mistrusts them, though no one dares to cross them or the king. There are eight ruling positions within the assembly, and the families of each member are appointed as lesser members without responsibility, called \"annexes.\" Mages of the assembly wander throughout the empire with little fear of argument or resistance.": "在此后的几个世纪里，地狱犬议会已经巧妙地将自己根植于帝国政府的大部分层面，成为一股政治和军事力量，许多人说它可以与国王本人相媲美。皇家委员会并没有忘记这一现实，议会和王室之间的关系经常紧张起来。议会的法师们因其奢侈的生活方式和令人生畏的政治和经济控制历史而闻名，许多民众对他们不信任，尽管没有人敢于与他们或国王过不去。议会内有八个统治职位，每个成员的家人都被任命为没有责任的次要成员，称为 \"附件\"。议会的法师们在帝国各地游荡，几乎不惧怕争论或抵抗。",

The assembly seeks to write history to favor its members as the architects of modern law and culture, with the eventual goal of subverting the power of the king, turning him into yet another puppet of the assembly's goals. Assembly mages believe that only they have the knowledge and talents to truly guide the empire into greatness.": "议会玩的是长期游戏，致力于巧妙地增加其在帝国内外的权力。民众的决定往往被公开表述为议会的意愿，而有冲突的问题则被定制为看起来纯粹是 \"王室的意愿\"，在这两个机构之间制造障碍。议会试图书写历史，使其成员成为现代法律和文化的设计师，最终目的是颠覆国王的权力，将他变成议会目标的另一个傀儡。集会法师们相信，只有他们拥有知识和才能，才能真正引导帝国走向伟大。",
	"Aside from political matters, the assembly is focused on locating and excavating powerful relics and magic lost to the Age of Arcanum. Its members believe that their original namesake was the apex of society across all history, and they seek to reclaim their place as paragons of mortal rule. Thus, all salvaged texts and artifacts of power from that era are to be recovered at all costs.": "除了政治事务之外，该组织还专注于寻找和挖掘阿卡努姆时代遗失的强大遗物和魔法。其成员相信他们最初的名字是所有历史上社会的顶点，他们试图重新获得他们作为凡人统治的典范的地位。因此，所有从那个时代抢救出来的文本和权力的文物都要不惜一切代价收回。",
	"The curious discovery of the power behind the Kryn Dynasty has recently drawn much of the assembly's attention. The mysterious, primal force known as dunamis could change the world's understanding of magic itself—and could even be the key to placing the assembly above all other rulers and nations. In pursuit of this goal, agents of the assembly stole two Luxon beacons from the Kryn Dynasty, though they subsequently lost one to a band of adventurers called the Mighty Nein. The assembly has dedicated immense effort to studying and exploiting this new form of magic, knowing full well that stealing the beacons is what caused the current war in the first place.": "克林王朝背后力量的奇怪发现最近引起了议会的广泛关注。这种神秘的、被称为dunamis的原始力量可能会改变世界对魔法本身的理解--甚至可能是将议会置于所有其他统治者和国家之上的关键。为了追求这个目标，议会的代理人从克里恩王朝那里偷了两个卢克松信标，尽管他们后来在一伙名为 \"强大的尼恩 \"的冒险家那里失去了一个。议会为研究和利用这种新的魔法形式付出了巨大的努力，他们清楚地知道，偷窃信标是导致当前战争的首要原因。",
	"The assembly has worked directly with the king and his chamber for so long that the two factions have become deeply intertwined, frustrating both of them. Though they rely heavily on each other, every smile and agreement barely conceals an undercurrent of venomous loathing. Some members of the assembly feel that it is far too soon to overtly challenge the Crown, while others believe it would be foolish to miss the opportunity the war is creating.": "议会直接与国王和他的议院合作了这么久，两派已经深深地交织在一起，使他们都感到沮丧。虽然他们互相依赖，但每一个微笑和协议都勉强掩盖了毒辣的厌恶的暗流。议会的一些成员认为，公开挑战王室还为时过早，而另一些人则认为，错过战争所创造的机会是愚蠢的。",
	"The assembly has established itself as the more forward-thinking face of the empire to the outside world, with Lord Athesias Uludan going out of his way to upstage the Crown at every diplomatic opportunity, all \"in the name of the king.\" Most foreign officials happily deal with the assembly instead of the Crown, especially those of the empire's closest trade partner, the Clovis Concord. The assembly ensures that such meetings are recounted to the king with embellished tales of their diplomatic success.": "议会已经确立了自己作为帝国在外部世界更有远见的形象，雅典娜-乌鲁丹勋爵不遗余力地在每一个外交机会上抬高王室的地位，所有这些都是 \"以国王的名义\"。大多数外国官员都乐意与议会打交道，而不是与王室打交道，尤其是那些帝国最亲密的贸易伙伴--克洛维协约的官员。议会确保在向国王汇报此类会议时，会美化他们的外交成功故事。",
	"The acquisition of a Luxon beacon and the hunger among assembly mages to unlock its powers have drawn the animosity of the Kryn Dynasty, triggering their attacks on the empire.": "卢克逊信标的获得以及集会法师们对解锁其力量的渴望，引起了克莱恩王朝的敌意，引发了他们对帝国的攻击。",

	"Trent is respected as the acclaimed Propagandist of the empire and the third oldest member of the assembly. Once an instructor at the Soltryce Academy, he only returns every few years to collect young students for his experiments in the mental conditioning that he calls \"awakening.\" Many of these students go mad and are locked away, but those who endure become zealots for the assembly and join the Volstrucker, an elite group of arcane thugs commonly known as Scourgers, who perform the assembly's dirtiest work under Trent's direction.": "特伦特被尊称为帝国著名的宣传员，也是议会中第三老的成员。他曾经是索尔特里斯学院的教员，每隔几年才回来收集年轻的学生，进行他称之为 \"觉醒 \"的精神调节实验。这些学生中的许多人都疯了，被关了起来，但那些经受住考验的人成为集会的狂热分子，并加入了Volstrucker，这是一个精英的奥术打手团体，通常被称为Scourgers，他们在特伦特的指导下执行集会最肮脏的工作。",
	"Ludinus is the oldest and only original member of the assembly, as well as the master of warfare and conflict. Charged with overhauling the military structure of the Dwendalian Empire, Ludinus directed the construction of the garrisons on the Xhorhasian border and often oversees their maintenance. He was one of the mages who survived the destruction of Molaesmyr and fled to Bysaes Tyl, but he saw the opportunity to achieve greatness within the empire and left his culture behind to continue his arcane pursuits. Wise, if emotionless, he bears a deep hatred for the Kryn Dynasty and spares no effort gathering information on their weaknesses and secrets. Ludinus spends most of his time developing arcane weapons of war and shoring up the military might of the empire, while subtly challenging the leadership of Crown Marshal Damurag.": "卢迪努斯是议会中最年长和唯一的原始成员，也是战争和冲突的主人。卢迪努斯负责整顿德文达里亚帝国的军事结构，他指导了霍哈斯边境的驻军建设，并经常监督其维护。他是在莫莱斯米尔的毁灭中幸存下来的法师之一，并逃到了Bysaes Tyl，但他看到了在帝国内取得伟大成就的机会，于是将他的文化抛在脑后，继续他的奥术追求。他很聪明，虽然没有感情，但对克莱恩王朝怀有深深的仇恨，不遗余力地收集关于他们的弱点和秘密的信息。路迪纳斯把大部分时间都花在了开发奥术战争武器和巩固帝国的军事力量上，同时巧妙地挑战了王室元帅达穆拉格的领导地位。",
	"One of the younger members of the assembly, Jenna is known for her business acumen and her extravagant lifestyle. By hiding her nature as a doppelganger and using memory-altering magics at a young age to fabricate a false past, Jenna constructed her human persona from the ground up, leveraging her powers of deception to essentially write herself into history as a Clovis Concord expatriate. She helps oversee central guild business in Rexxentrum under Guildmaster Kai Arness, and helps Exchequer Aethia Drooze organize the collection of tithes through starostas across the empire.": "作为集会的年轻成员之一，珍娜以其商业头脑和奢侈的生活方式而闻名。通过隐藏她作为二重身的本性，并在年轻时使用改变记忆的魔法来制造一个虚假的过去，珍娜从头开始构建了她的人类角色，利用她的欺骗能力，基本上把自己写进了历史，成为Clovis Concord的外籍人士。她在公会会长凯-阿尼斯的领导下，帮助监督雷克森特姆的中央公会业务，并帮助财政官艾西娅-德罗兹通过帝国各地的星际酒店组织征收什一税。",
	"The second-oldest member of the assembly, Doolan is in charge of the study and understanding of abnormal creatures and deviants of arcane creation that might threaten the empire's way of life. She is an absentminded yet brilliant gnome who is obsessed with all beasts, aberrations, and creatures of legend. Doolan imports creatures from around the world to study, disassemble, and use in her attempts to revolutionize magical practices. She resents the Library of the Cobalt Soul, as her reputation has caused them to bar her from their facilities. She wishes to catalog the unstudied horrors of Xhorhas and has covertly obtained the services of the Myriad to retrieve new specimens.": "杜兰是议会中年龄第二大的成员，负责研究和了解可能威胁到帝国生活方式的异常生物和奥秘创造的异类。她是一个心不在焉而又才华横溢的地精，对所有的野兽、反常者和传说中的生物都很着迷。杜兰从世界各地进口生物来研究、拆解，并在她试图革新魔法的实践中使用。她憎恨钴魂图书馆，因为她的名声已经导致他们禁止她进入他们的设施。她希望将Xhorhas的未研究过的恐怖事物编成目录，并暗中获得了Myriad的服务，以检索新的标本。",
	"Athesias's charm and bombastic personality serve him well as a diplomat. His duty is to foster a positive relationship with people of power both within and beyond the borders of the empire. He was originally one of the most effective instructors at the Soltryce Academy, but his penchant for spectacle and his rampant narcissism made him a difficult ally to trust with state secrets. When the office of Diplomatic Union opened, he was quickly and quietly reassigned. Athesias finds great pleasure in ruining or usurping the plans of his counterpart in the Crown's employ, Emissary Lord Zeddan Graf.": "雅典娜的魅力和轰轰烈烈的个性使他很适合做一名外交官。他的职责是促进与帝国境内外有权力的人建立积极的关系。他原本是索尔特里斯学院最有效的教官之一，但他对场面的喜好和猖獗的自恋使他成为一个难以信任的盟友，无法掌握国家机密。当外交联盟办公室开业时，他很快就被悄悄地调走了。阿蒂西亚斯在破坏或篡改他在王室的同行--使者泽丹-格拉夫勋爵的计划中找到了极大的乐趣。",

As an instructor at the Soltryce Academy for over two decades, Vess has studied and unraveled a number of historical mysteries and pre-Calamity riddles—and hoarded some of the spoils for herself. Always eager to pursue forgotten lore and artifacts of eons past, Vess has been known to quietly vanish to Xhorhas for weeks at a time, returning with fewer guards and more uncovered secrets.": "薇丝一生中大部分时间都隐居在公众场合，她既是一位出色的法师，又是一位敬业的历史学家。她在接替她的犯罪前任德利拉-布里亚伍德夫人后担任这一职务。作为索尔特里斯学院的教员，二十多年来，韦斯研究并解开了许多历史谜团和卡拉麦斯之前的谜题，并为自己囤积了一些战利品。薇丝总是热衷于追求被遗忘的传说和年代久远的文物，据了解，她每次都会悄悄地消失在Xhorhas几个星期，回来时守卫更少，揭开的秘密更多。",
	"Zivan Margolin inherited the position of headmaster from his father, the late Jorma Margolin. Zivan has been the headmaster of the Soltryce Academy in Rexxentrum for nearly twenty years. Calm, patient, and quietly imposing, Zivan walks the halls of the Academy with a keen eye for talent. He is in charge of the curriculum and also watches for any latent powers that may be worth grooming as future allies of the assembly, dangers to be monitored, or prospective minds for Ikithon to conscribe into the Volstrucker. Zivan has rarely had the opportunity to demonstrate his full power, for he is typically busied with keeping the peace between the feuding members of the assembly. Those who have witnessed his true might, however, now know that his words are backed by some of the most powerful magics within the Cerberus Assembly.": "齐万-马戈林从他的父亲，已故的约尔马-马戈林那里继承了校长的职位。兹万担任雷克森特鲁姆的索尔特里斯学院的校长已近20年了。冷静、耐心、安静的气势，齐万以敏锐的眼光在学院的大厅里走动，寻找人才。他负责课程，同时也在观察任何可能值得培养为议会未来盟友的潜在力量，需要监控的危险，或者为伊基顿纳入Volstrucker的潜在思想。齐万很少有机会展示他的全部力量，因为他通常忙于维持议会成员之间的争斗和平。然而，那些见识过他真正威力的人现在知道，他的话是由地狱犬议会中一些最强大的魔法所支持的。",
	"The current headmaster of the Hall of Erudition in Zadash, Oremid is tasked with watching and grooming the next generation of mages and arcane specialists outside Rexxentrum. While he himself is a gentle soul who adores animals, he puts on the façade of a strict man with no sense of humor, which is further enhanced by the elemental influence of his earth genasi blood. He teaches students that failure is not an option, and that emotion is a barrier to one's true ability. Equally feared, respected, and privately loathed by the students (and some instructors), Oremid personally dismisses those who break under his school's curriculum and heaps joyous praise on those who endure their training.": "奥雷米德是扎达什博学堂的现任校长，他的任务是观察和培养雷克森特姆以外的下一代法师和奥术专家。虽然他本人是一个温柔的灵魂，喜欢动物，但他却装出一副没有幽默感的严格的面孔，而他的土系基因人血统的元素影响又进一步加强了这一点。他教导学生，失败不是一种选择，情感是一个人真正能力的障碍。奥雷米德对学生（和一些导师）既害怕又尊重，私下里也很厌恶，他亲自开除那些违反他学校课程的人，并对那些忍受训练的人大加赞赏。",
	"Nearly four hundred years ago, an alliance of the Ki'Nau islanders and foreign Marquesian traders founded a new nation on the tropical Menagerie Coast.

	"After the fall of the Julous Dominion and the rise of the Dwendalian Empire, the concord was eager to reach a diplomatic arrangement with the victorious empire. The empire recognized the difficulty of conquering the Clovis Concord and the challenge of managing their immense network of international trade, and acquiesced to a treaty. This loose alliance has been mutually beneficial for many generations, and the concord city of Nicodranas acts as a common ground for people of both nations. Both imperial Crownsguard and local Zhelezo keep the peace in Nicodranas, and both imperial and concord laws hold sway within the city. While this arrangement occasionally causes strain between the two governments, the marquises of the concord are happy to have the buffer of the empire between them and the ravenous wastes of Xhorhas.

Masquerading as purveyors of antiquities and foreign textiles, the Myriad focuses on providing their clients with exotic goods, such as illicit substances and magical beasts, or supplying hired muscle to intimidate their clients' rivals. The worst of the Myriad even deal in human merchandise.": "该集团以惊人的速度发展壮大，渗透到西威南迪尔的每一个主要城市的犯罪底层。Myriad伪装成古董和外国纺织品的销售商，专注于为他们的客户提供异国货物，如非法物质和魔兽，或提供雇佣兵来恐吓他们客户的对手。最糟糕的妙手回春组织甚至从事人类商品的交易。",
	"Originally centered in Yrrosa, the Myriad now operates across the continent as a loose network of gang bosses who run their own local sects without direct oversight from the mysterious heads of the syndicate. Each satellite group is expected to regularly deliver information and a cut of their profits to the leadership. Those who fail to pay up receive quiet threats of enslavement or assassination—and the Myriad always makes good on its threats.": "Myriad最初以Yrrosa为中心，现在作为一个松散的帮派老大网络在整个大陆运作，他们在没有神秘的集团首脑直接监督的情况下经营自己的地方教派。每个卫星组织都要定期向领导层提供信息和利润分成。那些不交钱的人就会收到奴役或暗杀的悄悄威胁--而妙手回春集团总是会兑现其威胁。",
	"Members of the Myriad are sworn to keep their syndicate secret by pretending that their chapter is still just another local gang. This has given the Myriad a sinister and enigmatic reputation, which further obfuscates its activities from the authorities. Since members of the the Myriad prefer coercion to public displays of violence, officers of the law often fail to recognize Myriad activity until it's too late.": "妙手回春的成员发誓要保守他们集团的秘密，假装他们的分会仍然只是一个地方帮派。这给了妙手回春一个阴险和神秘的名声，这进一步模糊了它的活动，使当局无法了解。由于妙手回春的成员更喜欢胁迫，而不是公开展示暴力，因此执法人员往往不能识别妙手回春的活动，直到为时已晚。",
	"The empire scored a major victory fifteen years ago when they discovered and raided the central Myriad stronghold in Yrrosa, forcing the surviving leadership to scatter across the continent. The Myriad has emphasized the narrative of its own fall in order to keep a low profile, though in fact it has retained most of its power. Its influence has stretched to the distant corners of Wildemount as it bide its time and waits to reinstate its control within the empire. Shifting tactics, the Myriad has now begun seeding major factions with double agents, who turn the most foolish or corrupt of their colleagues into the Myriad's unwitting pawns.": "15年前，帝国取得了一场重大的胜利，他们发现并突袭了迈瑞德在伊尔罗萨的中心据点，迫使幸存的领导层分散到整个大陆。为了保持低调，Myriad强调了自己的堕落的叙述，尽管事实上它保留了大部分权力。它的影响力已经延伸到野蛮人的遥远角落，因为它在等待时机，等待在帝国内恢复其控制。Myriad改变了策略，现在已经开始在主要的派别中加入双重间谍，他们把最愚蠢或最腐败的同事变成Myriad不知情的棋子。",
	"The loss of their headquarters taught the surviving Myriad leaders to temper their arrogance with caution. Now a decentralized network of allies and informants, the Myriad is reconnecting with their temporarily dormant contacts, not all of whom are happy to see their cruel masters return.": "总部的损失让幸存的妙音派领导人学会了以谨慎的态度对待他们的傲慢。现在，作为一个由盟友和线人组成的分散网络，妙音会正在与他们暂时休眠的联系人重新建立联系，并不是所有的人都乐意看到他们残忍的主人回来。",
	"Beyond the borders of the Dwendalian Empire, the Myriad has deftly utilized the chaos of the Revelry's decades-long reign of piracy to infiltrate the guilds of the Clovis Concord. Between the war in the east and the distractions on the western waters, there has never been a better time for the Myriad to strike.": "在德文达尔帝国的边界之外，妙音派巧妙地利用启示录几十年来的海盗统治的混乱局面，渗透到克洛维斯协约的行会中。在东部的战争和西部海域的分心之间，对妙手回春来说，从来没有一个更好的时机。",
	"Merely mentioning Myriad activity within the Dwendalian Empire or the Menagerie Coast is enough to draw unwanted attention; members of the local law enforcement might investigate the rumors—and the person who started them. Those involved with the Myriad often vanish into the darkest prisons, or worse. Though the Myriad has apparently scattered since the raid on their base in Yrrosa, the authorities still keep an eye open for cell activity.": "仅仅提到迈瑞德（Myriad）在德文达里安帝国或玛纳吉海岸的活动，就足以引起不必要的注意；当地执法部门的成员可能会调查这些谣言--以及引起这些谣言的人。那些与Myriad有关的人往往会消失在最黑暗的监狱中，或者更糟。虽然自从突袭了他们在Yrrosa的基地后，Myriad显然已经分散了，但当局仍然对细胞的活动保持着关注。",
	"Twenty years ago, the Myriad established satellite cells in the distant lands of Tal'Dorei and Marquet. Since their headquarters in Wildemount was destroyed, some have suggested sending agents across the oceans to reinforce their foreign operatives. If the network can quickly regain its former strength, there will eventually be little chance of stopping the spread of its power and influence.": "20年前，迈瑞德在遥远的塔尔多雷和马尔凯的土地上建立了卫星小组。自从他们在Wildemount的总部被摧毁后，一些人建议派特工越过大洋去加强他们的外国特工人员。如果该网络能够迅速恢复其以前的实力，最终几乎没有机会阻止其权力和影响力的扩散。",
	"In the supposed absence of the Myriad, the Tribes of Shadycreek Run have begun to push into the empire to stake their claim in Myriad territory. The leaders of the Myriad watch from the shadows and plot ways to conscript (or, if necessary, to destroy) the prideful families of Shadycreek Run.": "在Myriad缺席的情况下，Shadycreek Run的部落已经开始向帝国推进，在Myriad的领土上建立自己的主张。迈瑞德的领导人在暗处观察，并策划如何征召（或在必要时摧毁）沙迪克雷克流的骄傲的家庭。",
	"The dangerous aspirations of the Myriad are driven by a curiously scattered collective of intelligent liars.": "Myriad的危险愿望是由一个奇怪的分散的智能骗子集体驱动的。",
	"This lovely, elderly woman is deeply respected and beloved for her wise, spiritual guidance and seemingly gentle demeanor. This persona kept her safe in Yrrosa, and now in Rexxentrum, where she is one of the masterminds planning the return of the Myriad. Insightful, clever, and unhesitating in her cruelty, Iris has long been considered the driving force behind the Myriad's success.": "这位可爱的老年妇女因其睿智的精神指导和看似温和的举止而深受尊重和喜爱。这种性格使她在伊尔罗萨很安全，现在在雷克森特姆也是如此，她是策划妙手回春的主谋之一。洞察力强、聪明、毫不犹豫的残忍，艾瑞丝长期以来一直被认为是迈瑞德成功背后的驱动力。",
	"A talented physician and healer, Waldorf often travels between Port Damali and Zadash, tending to affluent patients with rare diseases. His proximity to powerful figures in their most vulnerable moments grants the good doctor a source of highly sensitive information and a reputation as a savior. This combination of influence and access makes him a key information broker for the Myriad.": "作为一名有天赋的医生和治疗师，沃尔多夫经常往返于达马里港和扎达什之间，照顾患有罕见疾病的富裕病人。他在有权势的人最脆弱的时候接近他们，使这位好医生获得了高度敏感的信息来源和救世主的声誉。这种影响力和接触机会的结合使他成为迈瑞德的重要信息中介。",
	"The Gentleman has held a position of influence in the shadows of Zadash for nearly two decades, using his charm and connections throughout the city to carve a sizeable niche for himself in the Underworks beneath the city. These days, he's respected as a suave crime lord with dozens of reliable cutthroats and thieves at his beck and call.": "近二十年来，\"绅士 \"在扎达什的阴影中占据了一个有影响力的位置，利用他的魅力和整个城市的关系，在城市下面的地下工程中为自己开辟了一个可观的位置。如今，他被尊称为风流倜傥的犯罪头目，有几十个可靠的杀手和盗贼听从他的召唤。",
	"A patient and intimidating figure in the underground of Deastok for over forty years, Korshad is often known as the \"debtkeeper.\" He sends agents and missives to individuals throughout the empire who fall behind on their payments to the Myriad. Korshad is a mysterious figure by his own design, and he shrouds himself in illusion magic for his own protection and prestige, feeding the whispered myths about him that are legendary in unscrupulous circles.": "在迪斯多克的地下世界里，科沙德是一个有耐心和有威慑力的人物，四十多年来，他经常被称为 \"债务管理人\"。他向整个帝国的个人派遣代理人和信使，这些人拖欠了他们对Myriad的付款。Korshad是一个他自己设计的神秘人物，他为了保护自己和声望，把自己笼罩在幻觉的魔法中，为那些在不择手段的圈子里流传的关于他的低调的神话提供素材。",
	"A talented songstress and dancer renowned throughout the Menagerie Coast for her sweet voice and enchanting allure, Chessia is a popular performer in many opulent social circles across Port Damali. Chessia uses her charming persona to deflect suspicion as she weaves her way into the lives of politicians and guild masters to steer them toward Myriad interests.": "切斯亚是一位才华横溢的女歌手和舞蹈家，因其甜美的歌声和迷人的诱惑力而闻名于整个Menagerie海岸，她是达玛利港许多富裕的社交圈中的热门表演者。切斯亚利用她迷人的人格魅力来转移人们的怀疑，她将自己编织成政治家和行会会长的生活，引导他们走向迈瑞德的利益。",
	"In the echoing stillness that followed the Divergence, the ruined lands of the surface retained remnants of civilizations trying to rebuild their world from the ashes. Below, however, the surviving children of Lolth could feel her presence fade with her banishment. The chains she held over her drow were weakened, and those who had found renewed faith and purpose in the discovery of the Luxon abandoned their terrible mistress and slowly climbed their way to the surface to reclaim Ghor Dranas and be rid of their spiteful god for eternity.": "在分歧之后的回声寂静中，地表的废墟上保留着试图从灰烬中重建世界的文明的残余。然而，在下面，幸存的洛尔思的孩子们可以感觉到她的存在随着她的放逐而消逝。她对乌鸦的束缚被削弱了，那些在发现卢克松的过程中找到了新的信仰和目标的人放弃了他们可怕的女主人，慢慢地爬上了地表，去夺回戈尔-德拉纳斯，并永远摆脱了他们可恶的神。",
	"Still reeling from her banishment to the Abyss, Lolth felt a rapid shift in her influence as these drow turned from her. Her fury burned with a poisonous hate, and she seethed in her webs as she plotted vengeance on her ungrateful and treasonous progeny. As time passed and her dark divinity gradually recovered, the Spider Queen set aside her pride in favor of her wish to punish; she began seducing the minds of goblinoids, beastfolk, and the wayward people of the wastes, creeping into their dreams and convincing them to love her, bending them to join in her violent hate for the rising Kryn Dynasty. She found drow who felt spurned by the Dens of the dynasty and preyed on their fears and insecurities, amplifying their xenophobia as the dynasty recruited more and more outsiders to their cause. Gradually, Lolth developed a new network of scattered worshipers, spies, and assassins. She calls them her Children of Malice, and they will gladly serve as the instruments of her revenge.": "洛尔思还在为她被放逐到深渊而感到不安，当这些乌鸦转向她时，她的影响力迅速转变。她的怒火燃烧着有毒的仇恨，她在她的网中发怒，策划着对她忘恩负义和叛逆的后代的复仇。随着时间的流逝，她的黑暗神性逐渐恢复，蜘蛛女皇放下了她的骄傲，转而支持她的惩罚愿望；她开始勾引地精、兽人和荒原上不听话的人们的思想，潜入他们的梦中，说服他们爱她，让他们加入她对崛起的克莱恩王朝的暴力仇恨。她找到了那些感到被王朝的巢穴所唾弃的鸦人，并利用他们的恐惧和不安全感，随着王朝招募越来越多的外来者加入他们的事业，放大了他们的仇外心理。渐渐地，洛尔思发展了一个由分散的崇拜者、间谍和暗杀者组成的新网络。她称他们为她的 \"恶意之子\"，他们很乐意作为她复仇的工具。",
	"The Children of Malice aren't numerous, but they are clever, driven, and directed by a god of pure hatred. They established hidden cabals throughout the fringes of Xhorhasian society, forming motley bands of Lolthite bugbears and hobgoblins who raid outlying Kryn settlements. Drow agents of Lolth have infiltrated even the highest echelons of Kryn society, slowly poisoning the dynasty both metaphorically and literally. The true extent of this infiltration is only now being uncovered within Rosohna, spreading fear throughout the dynasty as the war against the Dwendalian Empire continues to divide the attention of the Bright Queen between the enemy outside and the enemy within.": "恶意之子的数量并不多，但他们很聪明，有动力，并由一个纯粹的仇恨之神指挥。他们在Xhorhasian社会的边缘地带建立了隐藏的阴谋，形成了由洛尔兹虫人和霍布格林组成的杂牌军，袭击克莱恩的外围定居点。洛尔兹的代理人甚至渗透到了克莱恩社会的最高层，慢慢地从隐喻和字面意义上毒害了这个王朝。这种渗透的真正程度直到现在才在罗索纳内部被揭露出来，在整个王朝中散布着恐惧，因为对德文达里安帝国的战争继续将光明女王的注意力分散在外部的敌人和内部的敌人之间。",
	"The primary goal of the Children of Malice is to subjugate and dismantle the flourishing, Luxon-worshiping dark elf society in Xhorhas. They wish to raze everything the Kryn have built, crush their will, ruin the holy implements of the Luxon, and drag these broken, traitorous drow back under Lolth's influence and command.": "恶意之子的主要目标是征服和瓦解Xhorhas中繁荣的、崇拜卢克逊的黑暗精灵社会。他们希望夷平克莱恩人所建立的一切，粉碎他们的意志，毁掉卢克逊的圣器，并将这些破碎的、叛逆的乌鸦拖回洛尔兹的影响和指挥之下。",
	"To achieve this goal, Lolth and her children know well the necessary tenets of secrecy, lies, and patience. Most of their spies are sleeper agents who wait in the shadows, quietly gaining converts while worming their way into the heart of Rosohna and awaiting the order to strike.": "为了实现这一目标，洛尔思和她的孩子们深知秘密、谎言和耐心的必要信条。他们的大部分间谍都是潜伏的特工，他们在阴影中等待，悄悄地获得皈依者，同时以蠕动的方式进入罗索纳的心脏，等待攻击的命令。",
	"The Children of Malice have no formal alliances; they prefer to infiltrate other factions as part of their design to undermine the dynasty. Keeping their true nature hidden, members of the Children trade with outlying camps and townships across the Wastes for supplies and information. Thus, their informants are usually unaware they are informants as they trade gossip for goods and conversation, unwittingly feeding the enemy.": "恶灵之子没有正式的联盟；他们更喜欢渗透到其他派别中去，作为他们破坏王朝的计划的一部分。为了隐藏自己的真实身份，恶灵之子的成员与荒原上的外围营地和乡镇进行交易，以获取物资和信息。因此，他们的线人通常不知道他们是线人，因为他们用流言蜚语换取货物和谈话，不知不觉中为敌人提供食物。",
	"The Children of Malice vary dramatically in both appearance and methods.": "恶意的孩子们在外观和方法上都有很大的不同。",
	"Zyn was born in squalor in the Coronas of Rosohna. Lolth found him at his nadir and showed him how to refine himself into a true liar. He's since risen to become one of the more even-tempered members of Den Daev'yana, climbing the ranks as a respected strategist and writer. Using his position to sew discord and doubt amongst the Dens, he privately communes with the Spider Queen as one of her most trusted operatives.": "Zyn出生在Rosohna的Coronas的肮脏环境中。洛尔思在他的低谷时发现了他，并告诉他如何将自己炼成一个真正的骗子。此后，他上升为Den Daev'yana中脾气更平和的成员之一，作为一个受人尊敬的战略家和作家不断攀升。他利用自己的地位在丹斯中制造不和谐和怀疑，作为蜘蛛女王最信任的特工之一，他私下里与她交流。",
	"A talented harpist lauded throughout Rosohna for their musical gifts, Ereldra worshiped the Luxon before they were betrayed by their own brother, who sabotaged their marriage to their wife. Lolth found Ereldra in their despair and molded them into a valuable spy. Ereldra weakens in the social foundation of the Dens by spreading rumors and telling lies.": "Ereldra是一位才华横溢的竖琴师，因其音乐天赋而受到整个罗索纳的称赞，在他们被自己的兄弟背叛之前，Ereldra崇拜卢克逊，后者破坏了他们与妻子的婚姻。Lolth在他们的绝望中发现了Ereldra，并将他们塑造成一个有价值的间谍。Ereldra通过散布谣言和说谎话削弱了登斯的社会基础。",
	"A feared warlord who guides a nomadic band of Lolthite hobgoblin warriors, Jaglord honed the skills of his marauders in the broken lands of the Barbed Fields, where they brazenly attacked Kryn trade caravans and supply wagons before vanishing into the deadly fields. As his war band grew larger and more capable, he boldly led them farther south, eventually coming to rest within the Ghostlands outside Rosohna, where they now patiently await further orders from the Spider Queen.": "贾格洛德是一位令人敬畏的军阀，他领导着一支由洛尔塞特妖精战士组成的游牧部落，他在倒刺地带的破碎土地上磨练了他的掠夺者的技能，他们在那里厚颜无耻地袭击了克莱恩贸易商队和补给车，然后消失在致命的领域中。随着他的战队越来越大，能力越来越强，他大胆地带领他们向南走去，最终在罗索纳外的鬼域中休息，现在他们在那里耐心地等待着蜘蛛女王的进一步命令。"
