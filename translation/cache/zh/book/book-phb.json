	"The Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game is about storytelling in worlds of swords and sorcery. It shares elements with childhood games of make-believe. Like those games, D&D is driven by imagination. It's about picturing the towering castle beneath the stormy night sky and imagining how a fantasy adventurer might react to the challenges that scene presents.": "龙与地下城 \"角色扮演游戏是关于在剑与魔法的世界中讲故事。它与童年的虚构游戏有着共同的元素。像那些游戏一样，D&D是由想象力驱动的。它是关于想象暴风雨的夜空下高耸的城堡，想象一个幻想中的冒险家会如何应对这个场景带来的挑战。",
	"{@b Dungeon Master (DM):} After passing through the craggy peaks, the road takes a sudden turn to the east and Castle Ravenloft towers before you. Crumbling towers of stone keep a silent watch over the approach. They look like abandoned guardhouses. Beyond these, a wide chasm gapes, disappearing into the deep fog below. A lowered drawbridge spans the chasm, leading to an arched entrance to the castle courtyard. The chains of the drawbridge creak in the wind, their rust-eaten iron straining with the weight. From atop the high strong walls, stone gargoyles stare at you from hollow sockets and grin hideously. A rotting wooden portcullis, green with growth, hangs in the entry tunnel. Beyond this, the main doors of Castle Ravenloft stand open, a rich warm light spilling into the courtyard.": "{@b Dungeon Master (DM):} 穿过峭壁的山峰后，道路突然向东转弯，雷文洛夫特城堡在你面前耸立。摇摇欲坠的石塔静静地守望着这条路。它们看起来像废弃的警卫室。在这些塔楼之外，有一条宽阔的鸿沟，消失在下面的深雾中。一座放下的吊桥横跨鸿沟，通向城堡庭院的一个拱形入口。吊桥的铁链在风中吱吱作响，被锈蚀的铁器因重量而变得紧张。从高大坚固的墙顶上，石像鬼从空洞的口袋里盯着你，露出狰狞的笑容。一个腐烂的木制门闩，长满了绿色，挂在入口处的通道上。除此之外，雷文洛夫特城堡的大门敞开着，浓郁的暖光洒进院子里。",
	"{@b Phillip (playing Gareth):} I want to look at the gargoyles. I have a feeling they're not just statues.": "{@b Phillip (playing Gareth):}我想看看那些石像鬼。我有一种感觉，他们不仅仅是雕像。",
	"{@b Amy (playing Riva):} The drawbridge looks precarious? I want to see how sturdy it is. Do I think we can cross it, or is it going to collapse under our weight?": "{@b Amy (playing Riva):}吊桥看起来很不稳定？我想看看它有多结实。我认为我们可以越过它，还是它将在我们的重量下坍塌？",
	"Unlike a game of make-believe, D&D gives structure to the stories, a way of determining the consequences of the adventurers' action. Players roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their adventurers can scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a magical lightning bolt, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.": "与虚构的游戏不同，D&D为故事提供了结构，一种决定冒险者行动后果的方式。玩家通过掷骰子来决定他们的攻击是否命中，或者他们的冒险者是否能爬上悬崖，滚开魔法闪电的攻击，或者完成一些其他的危险任务。任何事情都有可能，但骰子使一些结果比其他结果更有可能。",
	"{@b Dungeon Master (DM):} OK, one at a time. Phillip, you're looking at the gargoyles?": "{@b Dungeon Master (DM):}好，一次一个。菲利普，你在看石像鬼？",
	"{@b Phillip:} Yeah. Is there any hint they might be creatures and not decorations?": "{@b Phillip:}是的，有什么提示他们可能是生物而不是装饰品吗？",
	"{@b DM:} Make an Intelligence check.": "{@b DM:}做一个智力检查。",
	"{@b Phillip:} Does my Investigation skill apply?": "{@b Phillip:} 我的调查技能是否适用？",
	"{@b DM:} Sure!": "{@b DM:} 当然!",
	"{@b Phillip (rolling a d20):} Ugh. Seven.": "{@b Phillip (rolling a d20):}唉。七个。",
	"{@b DM:} They look like decorations to you. And Amy, Riva is checking out the drawbridge?": "{@b DM:}对你来说，它们看起来像装饰品。而艾米，里瓦正在检查吊桥？",
	"In the Dungeons & Dragons game, each player creates an adventurer (also called a character) and teams up with other adventurers (played by friends).": "在龙与地下城游戏中，每个玩家创建一个冒险者（也叫角色），并与其他冒险者（由朋友扮演）组成团队。",
	"Working together, the group might explore a dark dungeon, a ruined city, a haunted castle, a lost temple deep in a jungle, or a lava-filled cavern beneath a mysterious mountain. The adventurers can solve puzzles, talk with other characters, battle fantastic monsters, and discover fabulous magic items and other treasure.": "大家一起努力，可能会探索一个黑暗的地牢、一个破败的城市、一个闹鬼的城堡、一个丛林深处的失落的寺庙，或者一个神秘的山下充满熔岩的洞穴。冒险家们可以解决谜题，与其他角色交谈，与神奇的怪物战斗，并发现美妙的魔法物品和其他宝藏。",
	"One player, however, takes on the role of the Dungeon Master (DM), the game's lead storyteller and referee.": "然而，有一个玩家扮演了地下城主（DM）的角色，他是游戏的主要讲故事者和裁判员。",
	"The DM creates adventures for the characters, who navigate its hazards and decide which paths to explore. The DM might describe the entrance to Castle Ravenloft, and the players decide what they want their adventurers to do. Will they walk across the dangerously weathered drawbridge? Tie themselves together with rope to minimize the chance that someone will fall if the drawbridge gives way? Or cast a spell to carry them over the chasm? Then the DM determines the results of the adventurers' actions and narrates what they experience. Because the DM can improvise to react to anything the players attempt, D&D is infinitely flexible, and each adventure can be exciting and unexpected.": "DM为角色创造冒险，他们在冒险中穿梭于危险之中，决定探索哪条道路。DM可能会描述Ravenloft城堡的入口，而玩家则决定他们的冒险者要做什么。他们会走过危险的风化的吊桥吗？用绳子把自己绑在一起，以减少吊桥让路时有人掉下去的机会？还是施展法术将他们带过鸿沟？然后，DM决定冒险者行动的结果，并叙述他们的经历。因为DM可以对玩家的任何尝试做出即兴反应，所以D&D具有无限的灵活性，每次冒险都可以是令人兴奋和意想不到的。",
	"The game has no real end; when one story or quest wraps up, another one can begin, creating an ongoing story called a campaign. Many people who play the game keep their campaigns going for months or years, meeting with their friends every week or so to pick up the story where they left off. The adventurers grow in might as the campaign continues. Each monster defeated, each adventure completed, and each treasure recovered not only adds to the continuing story, but also earns the adventurers new capabilities. This increase in power is reflected by an adventurer's level.": "游戏没有真正的结束；当一个故事或任务结束后，另一个故事可以开始，创造一个持续的故事，称为活动。许多玩这个游戏的人将他们的活动持续数月或数年，每隔一周左右与他们的朋友见面，在他们离开的地方重新开始故事。随着战役的继续，冒险者的力量也在增长。每一个被打败的怪物，每一次完成的冒险，以及每一次寻获的宝藏，不仅为持续的故事增添了色彩，而且还为冒险者赢得了新的能力。这种能力的提高反映在冒险者的等级上。",
	"There's no winning and losing in the Dungeons & Dragons game—at least, not the way those terms are usually understood. Together, the DM and the players create an exciting story of bold adventurers who confront deadly perils. Sometimes an adventurer might come to a grisly end, torn apart by ferocious monsters or done in by a nefarious villain. Even so, the other adventurers can search for powerful magic to revive their fallen comrade, or the player might choose to create a new character to carry on. The group might fail to complete an adventure successfully, but if everyone had a good time and created a memorable story, they all win.": "在龙与地下城游戏中没有输赢--至少不是人们通常理解的那种方式。管理员和玩家一起创造了一个令人兴奋的故事，大胆的冒险家们面对致命的危险。有时，冒险者可能会有一个可怕的结局，被凶猛的怪物撕碎或被邪恶的恶棍干掉。即便如此，其他冒险者可以寻找强大的魔法来使他们死去的同伴复活，或者玩家可以选择创建一个新的角色来继续下去。这群人可能无法成功地完成一次冒险，但如果每个人都玩得很开心，并创造了一个令人难忘的故事，他们就都赢了。",
	"The many worlds of the Dungeons & Dragons game are places of magic and monsters, of brave warriors and spectacular adventures. They begin with a foundation of medieval fantasy and then add the creatures, places, and magic that make these worlds unique.": "龙与地下城游戏的许多世界是魔法和怪物的地方，有勇敢的战士和壮观的冒险。它们以中世纪的幻想为基础，然后加入生物、地方和魔法，使这些世界变得独一无二。",
	"The worlds of the Dungeons & Dragons game exist within a vast cosmos called the {@b multiverse}, connected in strange and mysterious ways to one another and 10 other planes or existence, such as the Elemental Plane of Fire and the infinite Depths of the Abyss. Within this multiverse are an endless variety of worlds.": "龙与地下城游戏的世界存在于一个被称为{@b multiverse}的巨大宇宙中，以奇怪而神秘的方式彼此相连，并与其他10个存在的平面，如火元素平面和无边的深渊相连。在这个多元宇宙中，有无穷无尽的各种世界。",
	"Many of them have been published as official settings for the D&D game. The legends of the Forgotten Realms, Dragonlance, Greyhawk, Dark Sun, Mystara, and Eberron settings are woven together in the fabric of the multiverse. Alongside these worlds are hundreds of thousands more, created by generations of D&D players for their own games. And amid all the richness of the multiverse, you might create a world of your own.": "其中许多已经作为D&D游戏的官方设定出版。被遗忘的国度、龙之谷、灰鹰、黑暗太阳、神秘之地和埃伯龙等设定的传说在多元宇宙的结构中交织在一起。除了这些世界之外，还有几十万个世界，由几代D&D玩家为他们自己的游戏所创造。在多元宇宙的所有丰富内容中，你可能会创造一个属于你自己的世界。",
	"All these worlds share characteristics, but each world is set apart by its own history and cultures, distinctive monsters and races, fantastic geography, ancient dungeons, and scheming villains. Some races have unusual traits in different worlds. The halflings of the Dark Sun setting, for example, are Jungle-dwelling cannibals, and the elves are desert nomads. Some worlds feature races unknown in other settings, such as Eberron's war-forged, soldiers created and imbued with life to fight in the Last War. Some worlds are dominated by one great story, like the War of the Lance that plays a central role in the Dragonlance setting. But they're all D&D worlds, and you can use the rules in this book to create a character and play in any one of them.": "所有这些世界都有共同的特点，但每个世界都因其自身的历史和文化、独特的怪物和种族、奇妙的地理环境、古老的地牢和阴险的反派而与众不同。一些种族在不同的世界里有不同的特征。例如，黑暗太阳设定中的半身人是居住在丛林中的食人族，而精灵是沙漠游牧民族。有些世界的特点是在其他设定中不为人知的种族，例如Eberron的战争锻造者，他们创造并注入生命以在最后的战争中作战。有些世界由一个伟大的故事主导，比如在《龙之谷》设定中起核心作用的长枪战争。但它们都是D&D世界，你可以使用本书中的规则来创建一个角色，并在其中任何一个世界中游戏。",
	"Your DM might set the campaign on one of these worlds or on one that he or she created. Because there is so much diversity among the worlds of D&D, you should check with your DM about any house rules that will affect your play or the game. Ultimately, the Dungeon Master is the authority on the campaign and its setting, even if the setting is a published world.": "你的管理员可能会把活动设置在这些世界中的一个或他或她创造的一个世界上。由于D&D世界的多样性，你应该向你的DM了解任何会影响你的游戏或游戏的内部规则。归根结底，地下城管理人是活动和其设定的权威，即使该设定是一个已出版的世界。",
	"The Player's Handbook is divided into three parts.": "玩家手册》分为三个部分。",
	"{@b Part 1} is about creating a character, providing the rules and guidance you need to make the character you'll play in the game. It includes information on the various races, classes, backgrounds, equipment, and other customization options that you can choose from. Many of the rules in part 1 rely on material in parts 2 and 3. If you come across a game concept in part 1 that you don't understand, consult the book's index.": "{@b Part 1}是关于创建角色的，提供了你需要的规则和指导，以制作你将在游戏中扮演的角色。它包括关于各种种族、等级、背景、装备和其他可供选择的定制选项的信息。第一部分中的许多规则依赖于第二和第三部分的材料。如果你在第一部分中遇到不理解的游戏概念，请查阅本书的索引。",
	"{@b Part 2} details the rules of how to play the game, beyond the basics described in this introduction. That part covers the kinds of die rolls you make to determine success or failure at the tasks your character attempts, and describes the three broad categories of activity in the game; exploration, interaction, and combat.": "{@b Part 2}详细介绍了如何玩这个游戏的规则，超出了本介绍中描述的基本内容。这一部分涵盖了你为决定你的角色所尝试的任务的成败而进行的各种掷模，并描述了游戏中的三大类活动：探索、互动和战斗。",
	"{@b Part 3} is all about magic. It covers the nature of magic in the worlds of D&D, the rules for spellcasting, and the huge variety of spells available to magic-using characters (and monsters) in the game.": "{@b Part 3}是关于魔法的。它涵盖了D&D世界中魔法的本质、施法的规则以及游戏中使用魔法的角色（和怪物）可使用的大量法术。",
	"{@b 1. The DM describes the environment.} The DM tells the players where their adventurers are and what's around them, presenting the basic scope of options that present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room, what's on a table, who's in the tavern, and so on).": "{@b 1. The DM describes the environment.} DM告诉玩家他们的冒险者在哪里，以及他们周围有什么，提出基本的选择范围（一个房间有多少扇门，桌子上有什么，谁在酒馆里，等等）。",
	"{@b 2. The players describe what they want to do.} Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, \"We'll take the east door,\" for example. Other times, different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines an esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. The players don't need to take turns, but the DM listens to every player and decides how to resolve those actions.": "{@b 2. The players describe what they want to do.}有时一个玩家代表整个队伍说话，比如说，\"我们要走东门\"。其他时候，不同的冒险者做不同的事情：一个冒险者可能会搜索一个宝箱，而第二个冒险者会检查刻在墙上的深奥符号，第三个冒险者会留意怪物的情况。玩家不需要轮流做，但是DM会倾听每个玩家的意见，并决定如何解决这些行动。",
	"Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer wants to walk across a room and open a door, the DM might just say that the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the DM decides what happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action.": "有时，解决一个任务很容易。如果一个冒险者想走过一个房间并打开一扇门，DM可能只是说门开了，并描述门外是什么。但是，门可能是锁着的，地板可能隐藏着致命的陷阱，或者其他一些情况可能会使冒险者完成任务面临挑战。在这些情况下，DM决定会发生什么，通常依靠掷骰子来决定行动的结果。",
	"{@b 3. The DM narrates the results of the adventurers' actions.} Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.": "{@b 3. The DM narrates the results of the adventurers' actions.}描述结果往往会导致另一个决策点，这使游戏的流程直接回到了第1步。",
	"This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cautiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or locked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon.": "无论冒险者是在谨慎地探索一个废墟，与一个狡猾的王子交谈，还是与一条强大的龙进行殊死搏斗，这种模式都是成立的。",
	"In certain situations, particularly combat, the action is more structured and the players (and DM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the adventure.": "在某些情况下，特别是战斗，行动更有条理，玩家（和DM）确实轮流选择和解决行动。但大多数时候，游戏是流动和灵活的，适应冒险的环境。",
	"Often the action of an adventure takes place in the imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM's verbal descriptions to set the scene. Some DMs like to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other characters they play in the game. Sometimes, a DM might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures to represent each creature involved in a scene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.": "通常情况下，冒险的行动是在玩家和DM的想象中进行的，依靠DM的口头描述来设置场景。有些DM喜欢用音乐、艺术或录制的声音效果来帮助设置气氛，许多玩家和DM都为他们在游戏中扮演的各种冒险者、怪物和其他角色采用不同的声音。有时，管理员可能会布置一张地图，用代币或微型人物来代表场景中涉及的每个生物，以帮助玩家追踪每个人的位置。",
	"The game uses polyhedral dice with different numbers of sides. You can find dice like these in game stores and in many bookstores.": "该游戏使用多面体骰子，有不同的面数。你可以在游戏商店和许多书店里找到这样的骰子。"
