Other knighthoods are secular and nongovernmental organizations of warriors who follow a particular philosophy, or consider themselves a kind of extended family, similar to an order of monks. Although there are organizations, such as the Knights of the Shield, that use the trappings of knighthood without necessarily being warriors, most folk of Faer\u00fbn who hear the word \"knight\" think of a mounted warrior in armor beholden to a code.

Over time the small group grew and spread, gaining a following in places as far as Cormyr.
