	"Ages ago, the serene god Rao created a tool to shield his fledgling faithful against the evils of the Lower Planes. Yet, as eons passed, mortals developed their own methods of dealing with existential threats, and the crook was largely forgotten. In recent ages, though, the Crook of Rao was rediscovered and leveraged against the rising power of the Witch Queen Iggwilv (one of the names of the wizard Tasha). Although she was defeated, Iggwilv managed to damage the crook during the battle, infecting it with an insidious curse-and the potential for future victory. In the aftermath, the crook was again lost. Occasionally it reappears, but the famed artifact is not what it was. Whether or not the artifact's bearers realize its full threat, few risk using the Crook of Rao -potentially for the final time.": "很久以前，宁静的拉奥神创造了一个工具，以保护他的新生信徒免受下层世界的邪恶之害。然而，随着岁月的流逝，凡人开发了他们自己的方法来处理存在的威胁，这把钩子基本上被遗忘了。不过，在最近的年代里，拉奥的钩子被重新发现，并被用来对付巫婆女王伊格威夫（巫师塔莎的名字之一）的崛起。虽然她被打败了，但伊格威夫在战斗中设法损坏了羊角，使其感染了一个阴险的诅咒--以及未来胜利的可能性。事后，这把钩子再次丢失。偶尔它也会重新出现，但这个著名的神器已经不是原来的样子了。无论神器的持有者是否意识到它的全部威胁，很少有人冒险使用拉奥古克--可能是最后一次。",

Over the years, this curse has spread within the crook, threatening to violently pervert its ancient magic. If this occurs, the Crook of Rao, as it is currently known, is destroyed, its magical matrix inverting and exploding into a 50-foot-diameter portal. This portal functions as a permanent {@spell gate} spell cast by Iggwilv. The gate then, once per round on initiative count 20, audibly speaks a fiend's name in Iggwilv's voice, doing so until the gate calls on every fiend ever banished by the Crook of Rao.

The flood advances at a rate of 100 feet per round, moving away from the body of water where it began until it reaches the edge of the area of effect: at that point, the water flows downhill (and possibly recedes back to its origin).
