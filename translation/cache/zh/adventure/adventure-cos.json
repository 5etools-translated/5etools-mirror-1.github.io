	"It was 1978, and I was playing in one of my first dungeon adventures. It was being run by a friend I had known in high school, John Scott Clegg, and it was typical of the type of adventure that people played in those days. It was all about exploring a hodgepodge collection of rooms connected by dungeon corridors, beating up the monsters that we encountered, searching for treasure, and gaining experience points.": "那是1978年，我正在玩我的第一个地下城冒险。它是由我在高中时认识的一个朋友约翰-斯科特-克莱格（John Scott Clegg）经营的，它是那个时代人们玩的典型的冒险类型。它是关于探索由地牢走廊连接的房间的大杂烩集合，击败我们遇到的怪物，寻找宝藏，并获得经验值。",
	"Now we were face to face with random encounter number thirty-four: a vampire. Not a Vampire with a capital V, but a so-many-Hit-Dice-with-such-and-such-an-Armor-Class lowercase vampire. Just another monster in the dungeon.": "现在我们面对的是第三十四号随机遭遇：一个吸血鬼。不是大写字母V的吸血鬼，而是一个小写字母 \"Hit-Dice with-such-and-such-an-Armor \"的吸血鬼。只是地牢里的另一个怪物。",
	"I remember thinking at the time, What are {@i you} doing here? This creature seemed completely out of place with the kobolds, orcs, and gelatinous cubes we had seen thus far. This was a creature who deserved his own setting and to be so much more than just a wandering monster. When I came home from that game, I told all these thoughts to Laura.": "我记得当时我在想，{@i you}在这里做什么？这种生物似乎与我们迄今为止看到的哥布林、兽人和胶质方块完全不相称。这是一个值得他自己设定的生物，而且不仅仅是一个游荡的怪物。当我从那个游戏中回家时，我把所有这些想法告诉了劳拉。",
	"That was when {@creature Strahd von Zarovich|CoS} was born.": "就在那时，（%0%）诞生了。",
	"Strahd would be no afterthought—he demanded his own setting, his own tragic history. Laura and I launched into researching the mythology and folklore surrounding the vampire. We started with the vague, black-and-white image of Bela Lugosi in 1931, but found so much more.": "斯特拉特不是事后才想到的，他要求有自己的背景，有自己的悲惨历史。劳拉和我开始研究围绕吸血鬼的神话和民间传说。我们从贝拉-卢戈西在1931年的模糊的黑白形象开始，但发现了很多东西。",
	"The first \"modern\" literary foundation of the vampire was penned by John William Polidori based on a fragment of a story by Lord Byron. It was while at the Villa Diodati—a rented house next to Lake Geneva, Switzerland—that Byron and Polidori met Mary Wollstonecraft Godwin and her husband-to-be, Percy Shelley. One night in June, Byron suggested that they each write a ghost story. Mary Shelley's contribution to the effort would later become {@i Frankenstein}. The short story \"The Vampyre,\" published in 1819, was Polidori's contribution. He was Byron's personal physician, and the first of the so-called \"romantic\" vampires under Polidori's hand was actually modeled after Lord Byron.": "第一个关于吸血鬼的 \"现代 \"文学基础是由约翰-威廉-波利多里根据拜伦勋爵的一个故事片段写成的。拜伦和波利多里是在迪奥达蒂别墅--瑞士日内瓦湖旁边的出租屋--遇到玛丽-沃斯顿克拉夫特-戈德温和她的准丈夫珀西-雪莱的。六月的一个晚上，拜伦建议他们各自写一个鬼故事。玛丽-雪莱对这项工作的贡献后来成为（%0%）。短篇小说《吸血鬼》发表于1819年，是波利多里的贡献。他是拜伦的私人医生，波利多里手下的第一个所谓 \"浪漫 \"的吸血鬼实际上是以拜伦勋爵为原型的。",
	"Byron—like the fictional vampires that he inspired, from Polidori's Lord Ruthven down through the penultimate work of Bram Stoker—was a decadent predator, an abuser hidden behind a romantic veil. He was a comely and alluring monster—but a monster nevertheless. The romantic vampire of the earliest years of the genre was not just a spouse abuser but a spouse killer, the archetype of abuse in the worst kind of destructive codependency.": "拜伦与他所激发的虚构的吸血鬼一样，从波利多里的鲁斯文勋爵到布拉姆-斯托克的倒数第二部作品，都是一个颓废的掠夺者，一个隐藏在浪漫面纱后面的虐待者。他是一个可爱的、诱人的怪物，但还是一个怪物。该类型小说早期的浪漫吸血鬼不仅是一个配偶虐待者，而且是一个配偶杀手，是最糟糕的破坏性依赖中的虐待的典型代表。",
	"For Laura and me, those were the elements that truly defined {@creature Strahd von Zarovich|CoS}—a selfish beast forever lurking behind a mask of tragic romance, the illusion of redemption that was ever only camouflage for his prey.": "对劳拉和我来说，这些是真正定义{@creature Strahd von Zarovich|CoS}的元素--一个自私的野兽永远潜伏在悲剧性浪漫的面具后面，救赎的假象永远只是他猎物的伪装。",
	"Initially we were going to title the adventure {@i Vampyr}—one of a series of games we called Nightventure that Laura and I were self-publishing back in 1978. The castle was called Ravenloft, and when Halloween came around each year, our friends asked us if we could play \"that Ravenloft game\" again... and so the better title won out. It was, in part, because of this design that I was hired by TSR, Inc., to write {@b Dungeons & Dragons} adventures in 1982. Soon thereafter, I6 {@i Ravenloft} was published.": "最初，我们打算把这个冒险的标题定为{@i Vampyr}--我们称之为Nightventure的系列游戏之一，劳拉和我早在1978年就开始自行出版了。那座城堡叫Ravenloft，每年万圣节到来时，我们的朋友都会问我们能不能再玩一次 \"那个Ravenloft游戏\"......于是这个更好的标题就赢了。部分是由于这个设计，我在1982年被TSR公司雇用来写{@b Dungeons & Dragons}冒险。此后不久，I6{@i Ravenloft}就出版了。",
	"Since then, fans of {@i Ravenloft} have seen many different creative perspectives on Barovia (a country which, by absolute coincidence, is featured in a 1947 Bob Hope movie called {@i Where There's Life}). It continues to be one of the most popular {@b Dungeons & Dragons} adventures of all time. In its various incarnations, each designer has endeavored to bring something new to the ancient legend of Strahd, and to each of them we are grateful.": "从那时起，{@i Ravenloft}的粉丝们看到了许多关于巴罗维亚的不同创意观点（绝对巧合的是，这个国家在1947年鲍勃-霍普的一部名为{@i Where There's Life}的电影中出现）。它仍然是有史以来最受欢迎的{@b Dungeons & Dragons}冒险故事之一。在其不同的化身中，每个设计师都努力为古老的斯特拉赫特传说带来新的东西，我们对他们每个人都心存感激。",
	"But the vampire genre has taken a turn from its roots in recent years. The vampire we so often see today exemplifies the polar opposite of the original archetype: the lie that it's okay to enter into a romance with an abusive monster because if you love it enough, it will change.": "但近年来，吸血鬼流派已经从其根源上发生了转变。我们今天经常看到的吸血鬼体现了与原始原型截然相反的特点：谎言是，与一个虐待人的怪物谈恋爱是可以的，因为如果你足够爱它，它就会改变。",
	"When Laura and I got a call from Christopher Perkins about revisiting {@i Ravenloft}, we hoped we could bring the message of the vampire folktale back to its original cautionary roots. The talented team at Wizards of the Coast not only graciously took our suggestions but engaged us in a dialogue that delivered new insights on the nightmare beyond the gates of Barovia.": "当劳拉和我接到克里斯托弗-帕金斯关于重温{@i Ravenloft}的电话时，我们希望我们能把这个吸血鬼的民间故事的信息带回它最初的警戒性根源。海岸奇才的天才团队不仅慷慨地接受了我们的建议，还与我们进行了对话，对巴罗维亚城门外的噩梦提出了新的见解。",
	"Now we invite you again as our guests to pass through the Svalich Woods if you dare. For here the romance is tragically dangerous... and a true monster smiles at your approach.": "现在我们再次邀请你作为我们的客人，如果你敢于通过斯瓦里奇森林。因为这里的浪漫是悲惨的危险......一个真正的怪物对你的接近微笑着。",
	"Under raging storm clouds, a lone figure stands silhouetted against the ancient walls of Castle Ravenloft. The vampire Count {@creature Strahd von Zarovich|CoS} stares down a sheer cliff at the village below. A cold, bitter wind spins dead leaves about him, billowing his cape in the darkness.": "在汹涌的风暴云下，一个孤独的身影站在雷文洛夫特城堡古老的城墙上，显得格外显眼。吸血鬼伯爵（%0%）凝视着悬崖下的村庄。寒冷刺骨的风吹动着他身边的枯叶，在黑暗中吹起他的披风。",
	"Lightning splits the clouds overhead, casting stark white light across him. Strahd turns to the sky, revealing the angular muscles of his face and hands. He has a look of power—and of madness. His once handsome face is contorted by a tragedy darker than the night itself.": "闪电劈开了头顶的云层，在他身上投下刺眼的白光。斯特拉特转向天空，露出他脸上和手上的棱角分明的肌肉。他有一种力量和疯狂的表情。他曾经英俊的脸庞被一种比黑夜更黑暗的悲剧所扭曲。",
	"Rumbling thunder pounds the castle spires. The wind's howling increases as Strahd turns his gaze back to the village. Far below, yet not beyond his ken, a party of adventurers has just entered his domain. Strahd's face forms a twisted smile as his dark plan unfolds. He knew they were coming, and he knows why they have come—all according to his plan. He, the master of Ravenloft, will attend to them.": "隆隆的雷声敲打着城堡的尖顶。当斯特拉赫特将目光转向村庄时，风的呼啸声越来越大。在遥远的下方，但并不超出他的能力范围，一队冒险者刚刚进入他的领域。随着他的黑暗计划的展开，斯特拉赫特的脸上形成了一个扭曲的微笑。他知道他们会来，也知道他们为什么会来--一切都按照他的计划进行。他，拉文洛夫特的主人，将为他们服务。",
	"Another lightning flash rips through the darkness, its thunder echoing through the castle's towers. But Strahd is gone. Only the howling of the wind—or perhaps a lone wolf—fills the midnight air. The master of Ravenloft is having guests for dinner. And you are invited.": "另一道闪电撕裂了黑暗，它的雷声在城堡的塔楼上回荡。但斯特拉赫特不见了。午夜的空气中只有风的呼啸声，或者说是一匹孤狼。拉文洛夫特的主人要请客人吃饭。你被邀请了。",
	"{@i Curse of Strahd} is a story of gothic horror, presented here as {@b Dungeons & Dragons} roleplaying game adventure for a party of four to six adventurers of levels 1–10.

	"Module I6: {@i Ravenloft}, written by Tracy and Laura Hickman, broke new ground by presenting a D&D adventure that was as much story-driven as location-based, featuring a villain who was complex and terrifying.

	"This book includes the original adventure, as well as expanded material developed in consultation with Tracy and Laura Hickman. It expands what we know about the lands around Castle Ravenloft and sheds new light on the dark past of the castle's lord.

In time, cursed Barovia was torn from its home world by the Dark Powers and bound in mist as one of the Domains of Dread in the Shadowfell.": "本书包括原版冒险，以及与特雷西和劳拉-希克曼协商开发的扩展材料。它扩展了我们对雷文洛夫特城堡周围土地的了解，并为城堡主人的黑暗过去提供了新的线索。巴罗维亚的土地来自D&D多元宇宙中一个被遗忘的世界，这次冒险让人们瞥见了那个世界。随着时间的推移，被诅咒的巴罗维亚被黑暗势力从它的母体世界中剥离出来，并被束缚在迷雾中，成为阴影城中的恐惧之域之一。",

	"Of all the settlements in Strahd's domain, the village of Barovia is by far the most oppressed. Many of its shops are closed, and the locals have succumbed to despair. It is well known that Strahd desires the burgomaster's adopted daughter, {@creature Ireena Kolyana|CoS}. The villagers neither protect nor harm her, lest they incur the vampire's wrath. Few know that Ireena bears an uncanny resemblance to Tatyana, Strahd's dead beloved.": "在斯特拉赫特领地的所有定居点中，巴罗维亚村是迄今为止受压迫最严重的一个。许多商店都关门了，当地人已经屈服于绝望了。众所周知，斯特拉赫渴望得到镇长的养女（%0%）。村民们既不保护也不伤害她，以免引起吸血鬼的愤怒。很少有人知道，伊莲娜与斯特拉赫特死去的爱人塔蒂亚娜有着惊人的相似之处。",

It's not the monster, but its shadow, that breeds horror. The more we know about a monster, the less we fear it, so the trick is to keep it out of the light for as long as possible. Here are two tricks to heighten fear of the unknown:": "恐怖是源于对未知的恐惧。当黑暗吞噬了我们，我们看不见的时候，或者当真相在锁着的门后面，被床单覆盖，或者埋在柔软的土地里的时候，我们的恐惧就会加剧。滋生恐怖的不是怪物，而是它的阴影。我们对怪物了解得越多，就越不害怕它，所以诀窍是尽可能长时间地不让它见光。这里有两个技巧可以提高对未知事物的恐惧。",
	"When it seems as though the characters have everything under control, you can have a gust of wind suddenly blow out their torches, plunging them into darkness.": "当人物似乎一切都在掌控之中时，你可以让一阵风突然吹灭他们的火把，使他们陷入黑暗之中。",
	"Before a monster appears, take a moment to describe the odor that precedes it, the eerie sound it makes, or the weird shadow it casts.": "在怪物出现之前，花点时间描述它之前的气味，它发出的阴森恐怖的声音，或者它投下的诡异阴影。",
	"Foreshadowing is about finding clues to a horrible truth yet to be revealed. Consider the following examples:": "预示是为尚未揭示的可怕真相寻找线索。请看下面的例子。",
	"Before characters encounter a monster, hint at the monster's presence with clues such as claw marks, gnawed bones, and bloodstains.": "在人物遇到怪物之前，用爪痕、啃咬的骨头和血迹等线索暗示怪物的存在。",
	"Whenever characters take a long rest, give one character a prophetic dream in which he or she glimpses something yet to be found or encountered.": "每当人物长时间休息时，给一个人物一个预言性的梦，在梦中他或她瞥见了一些有待发现或遇到的东西。",
	"Barovia is the grim reflection of its undead master. Almost everything here is old and timeworn. Everywhere the adventurers go, they should be reminded of death, decay, and their own mortality. Here are a couple of ways to reinforce these pervasive themes:": "巴罗维亚是其亡灵主人的阴暗反映。这里几乎所有的东西都是陈旧的、过时的。冒险家们所到之处，都应该提醒他们死亡、腐烂和他们自己的死亡。这里有几个方法可以加强这些普遍存在的主题。",
	"Take time to describe the rotting timbers of buildings, the faded and moth-eaten clothing of the Barovian peasantry, the worm-ridden pages of old books, and the rust on iron fences and gates.": "花时间描述建筑物的腐朽木材、巴罗维亚农民褪色和虫蛀的衣服、旧书的虫蛀书页，以及铁栅栏和铁门上的锈迹。",
	"A character gazing into a mirror, a pool, or other reflective surface might glimpse an older, more decrepit version of himself or herself.": "凝视镜子、水池或其他反光表面的人物可能会瞥见一个更老、更颓废的自己。",
	"A tale that is perpetually dark in tone becomes tiresome very quickly. It needs to feature the occasional ray of light for contrast and to create a sense of hope. Monsters and other terrors must be offset with creatures that are kind and lovable, giving the characters even more reasons to stand against the darkness. Here are a couple of ways to add glimmers of light to a tragic tale:": "一个永远是黑暗色调的故事很快就会令人厌倦。它需要偶尔出现一丝光亮，以形成对比，并创造一种希望的感觉。怪兽和其他恐怖事物必须与善良可爱的生物相抵消，给人物更多的理由来对抗黑暗。这里有几种为悲剧故事添加光亮的方法。",
	"In a land as dreary as Barovia, take the time to describe the occasional scene of beauty, such as a pretty flower growing atop a grave.": "在巴罗维亚这样一片沉闷的土地上，花点时间描述偶尔出现的美丽景象，比如一朵生长在坟墓顶上的漂亮花朵。",
	"Make sure that the heroes have contact with NPCs who are honest, friendly, and helpful, such as the Martikovs in Vallaki or the Krezkovs in Krezk.": "确保英雄们与那些诚实、友好、乐于助人的NPC接触，比如瓦拉基的马蒂科夫人或克雷兹克的克雷兹科夫人。",
	"Ascribing human characteristics to an inanimate thing is one way to turn something ordinary into something malevolent. A groaning house, the wailing wind, grasping mud, and a squatting chest aren't just mundane things—they're characters in your story, made all the creepier thanks to their humanlike traits. Torches sputter nervously, rusty hinges shatter silence with their sudden cries of anguish, and cobwebs quietly beckon us to our doom. Here are more examples:": "给无生命的东西赋予人的特征是把普通的东西变成恶性的方法之一。呻吟的房子、呼啸的风、抓着的泥巴和蹲着的箱子不仅仅是平凡的东西--它们是你故事中的人物，由于它们具有人类的特征而变得更加令人惊悚。火把紧张地溅射，生锈的铰链以其突然的痛苦叫声打破了沉默，蜘蛛网悄悄地向我们招手，让我们走向死亡。这里有更多的例子。",
	"Imagine darkness as a silent crowd that follows the characters everywhere and stares at them while they sleep.": "想象一下，黑暗是一个无声的人群，跟随人物到处走，在他们睡觉时盯着他们。",
	"Imagine trees as towering giants that stand idle yet ever watchful as characters face the perils of the Svalich Woods alone.": "想象一下，当人物独自面对斯瓦里奇森林的危险时，树木就像高耸的巨人，无所事事却又时刻警惕着。",
	"In a horror story, there's no telling where danger might be lurking. A leering gargoyle might be a monster in disguise, or merely a fiendish sculpture. A mirror hanging on a wall might have the power to transfix all who gaze into it, or it might be nothing out of the ordinary. In a horror story, taking the time to describe an object in detail draws attention to it, makes one suspicious of it, and might distract from the real danger. Here are a couple of tricks you can use:": "在一个恐怖故事中，不知道哪里可能潜伏着危险。一个淫荡的石像鬼可能是一个伪装的怪物，或者只是一个邪恶的雕塑。挂在墙上的一面镜子可能有能力迷惑所有注视它的人，或者它可能没有什么特别之处。在一个恐怖故事中，花时间详细描述一个物体会引起人们的注意，使人们对它产生怀疑，并可能分散对真正危险的注意力。这里有几个你可以使用的技巧。",
	"In a given encounter area, choose one object or feature to describe in some detail. It need not be important to the story.": "在一个特定的遭遇区，选择一个物体或特征进行详细描述。它对故事不一定很重要。",
	"Allow the character who has the highest passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score to see, hear, or smell something that no one else can perceive.": "允许拥有最高被动智慧（（%0%））得分的角色看到、听到或闻到其他人无法感知的东西。",
	"There are no stranger bedfellows than horror and humor. Tension can't be sustained indefinitely, so a dash of humor provides a respite, giving horror a chance to sneak up on us later and catch us off guard. While humorous situations will occur naturally in the course of running the adventure, here are some tips for creating humor when needed:": "没有什么比恐怖和幽默更奇怪的搭配了。紧张的气氛不可能无限期地持续下去，所以一丁点的幽默可以提供一个喘息的机会，让恐怖有机会在稍后偷袭我们，让我们猝不及防。虽然幽默的情况会在冒险的过程中自然发生，但这里有一些在需要时创造幽默的提示。",
	"Allow NPCs (even evil ones) to tell jokes, speak in a funny voice, or behave idiotically. Even morbid humor is better than none.": "允许NPC（甚至是邪恶的NPC）讲笑话，用有趣的声音说话，或者表现得很白痴。即使是病态的幽默也比没有好。",
	"When a hero, villain, or monster rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, describe a humorous mishap that occurs as a result of the low roll, such as a character accidentally knocking over a lamp and setting some drapes on fire while trying to hide or move silently.": "当英雄、恶棍或怪物在攻击卷、能力检查或蓄力投掷中掷出自然数为1时，描述因掷出低分而发生的幽默事故，如人物在试图躲藏或悄悄移动时，不小心打翻了台灯，点燃了一些窗帘。",
	"Eerie mists surround Barovia and bind its inhabitants there. This chapter gives you the information you need to prepare for the adventurers' journey into those mists. The chapter first outlines the history and goals of Count {@creature Strahd von Zarovich|CoS} so that you are prepared for what awaits the characters. In the \"{@area Fortunes of Ravenloft|01d|x}\" section, the chapter walks you through the tarokka card reading that helps set the stage for the adventure's action, and the chapter closes with adventure hooks that you can use to draw the characters into the horror of Barovia.": "阴森恐怖的迷雾围绕着巴罗维亚，将其居民束缚在那里。这一章给你提供了你需要的信息，以便为冒险者进入这些迷雾做准备。本章首先概述了{@creature Strahd von Zarovich|CoS}伯爵的历史和目标，以便你对等待人物的情况有所准备。在\"{@area Fortunes of Ravenloft|01d|x} \"部分，本章将带领你完成塔罗卡牌的解读，这有助于为冒险的行动奠定基础，本章的结尾是冒险钩子，你可以用它来吸引角色进入巴罗维亚的恐怖之中。",
	"{@creature Strahd von Zarovich|CoS}, a vampire and wizard, has the statistics presented in {@area appendix D|7c1|x}. Although he can be encountered almost anywhere in his domain, the vampire is always encountered in the place indicated by the card reading later in this chapter, unless he has been forced into his tomb in the catacombs of Castle Ravenloft.": "{@creature Strahd von Zarovich|CoS}，一个吸血鬼和巫师，拥有{@area appendix D|7c1|x}中介绍的统计数据。虽然他几乎可以在他的领域内的任何地方遇到，但吸血鬼总是在本章后面的读牌所指示的地方遇到，除非他被强迫进入他在雷文洛夫特城堡地下墓穴的坟墓。",
	"In life, {@creature Strahd von Zarovich|CoS} was a count, a prince, a soldier, and a conqueror. After the death of his father, King Barov, Strahd waged long, bloody wars against his family's enemies. He and his army cornered the last of these enemies in a remote mountain valley before slaying them all. Strahd named the valley Barovia, after his deceased father, and was so struck by its scenic beauty that he decided to settle there.": "在生活中，{@creature Strahd von Zarovich|CoS}是一个伯爵，一个王子，一个士兵和一个征服者。在他的父亲巴罗夫国王死后，斯特拉赫特对他家族的敌人发动了漫长而血腥的战争。他和他的军队将这些敌人中的最后一个逼到了一个偏远的山谷里，然后将他们全部杀死。斯特拉特以其已故父亲的名字命名该山谷为巴罗维亚，并被其美丽的风景所震撼，决定在此定居。",
	"Queen Ravenovia lamented the death of Barov and was fearful of Strahd. War had made him cold and arrogant. She kept her younger son, Sergei, away from the battlefield. Strahd envied the love and attention his mother visited upon his brother, so in Barovia he remained. Peace made Strahd restless, and he began to feel like his best years were behind him. Unwilling to go the way of his father, Strahd studied magic and forged a pact with the Dark Powers of the Shadowfell in return for the promise of immortality.": "拉文维亚女王对巴罗夫的死感到惋惜，对斯特拉赫特感到恐惧。战争使他变得冷酷和傲慢。她让她的小儿子谢尔盖远离战场。斯特拉特羡慕母亲对弟弟的爱和关注，所以他留在巴罗维亚。和平让斯特拉赫特感到不安，他开始觉得自己最好的时光已经过去了。由于不愿意走父亲的老路，斯特拉赫特学习了魔法，并与暗影城的黑暗势力签订了契约，以换取不朽的承诺。",
	"Strahd scoured his conquered lands for wizards and artisans, brought them to the valley of Barovia, and commanded them to raise a castle to rival the magnificent fortresses of his ancestral homeland. Strahd named the castle Ravenloft, after his mother, to demonstrate his love for her. When it was complete, Strahd commanded his mother and brother to come to Barovia and stay with him. Sergei eventually took up residence at Ravenloft, but Ravenovia passed away while traveling to her namesake. In sorrowful disappointment, Strahd sealed his mother's body in a crypt beneath the castle.": "斯特拉特在他征服的土地上寻找巫师和工匠，把他们带到巴罗维亚谷地，并命令他们建造一座城堡，与他祖国的宏伟堡垒相媲美。斯特拉特以他母亲的名字命名这座城堡，以示对她的爱。城堡建成后，斯特拉赫特命令他的母亲和弟弟来到巴罗维亚，和他一起住。谢尔盖最终在拉文洛夫特住了下来，但拉文洛夫特在前往她的名字的途中去世了。在悲痛的失望中，斯特拉赫特将母亲的尸体封存在城堡下面的墓穴中。",
	"Strahd's attention soon turned to Tatyana, a young Barovian woman of fine lineage and remarkable beauty. Strahd believed her to be a worthy bride, and he lavished Tatyana with gifts and attention. Despite Strahd's efforts, she instead fell in love with the younger, warmer Sergei. Strahd's pride prevented him from standing in the way of the young couple's love until the day of Sergei and Tatyana's wedding, when Strahd gazed into a mirror and realized he had been a fool. Strahd murdered Sergei and drank his blood, sealing the evil pact between Strahd and the Dark Powers. He then chased Sergei's bride-to-be through the gardens, determined to make her accept and love him. Tatyana hurled herself off a castle balcony to escape Strahd's pursuit, plunging to her death. Treacherous castle guards, seizing the opportunity to rid the world of Strahd forever, shot their master with arrows.": "斯特拉特的注意力很快转移到塔季扬身上，她是一位年轻的巴罗维亚女子，拥有优良的血统和非凡的美丽。斯特拉特认为她是一个值得信赖的新娘，他给塔季扬娜送去了礼物和关注。尽管斯特拉赫特费尽心机，她还是爱上了更年轻、更热情的谢尔盖。斯特拉特的自尊心使他无法阻挡这对年轻夫妇的爱情，直到谢尔盖和塔季扬娜的婚礼那天，斯特拉特凝视着镜子，意识到自己是个傻瓜。斯特拉特杀害了谢尔盖，喝下了他的血，封印了斯特拉特和黑暗势力之间的邪恶契约。然后他在花园里追赶谢尔盖的准新娘，决心让她接受并爱上他。塔季扬娜为躲避斯特拉赫特的追捕，从城堡阳台上跳下，摔死了。狡猾的城堡守卫抓住机会，永远摆脱了斯特拉赫特，用箭射杀了他们的主人。",
	"But Strahd did not die. The Dark Powers honored the pact they had made. The sky went black as Strahd turned on the guards, his eyes blazing red. He had become a vampire.": "但斯特拉赫特并没有死。黑暗势力履行了他们的约定。天空一片漆黑，斯特拉赫特转身向卫兵走去，他的眼睛闪着红光。他已经变成了一个吸血鬼。",
	"After slaughtering the guards, Strahd saw the faces of his father and mother in the thunderclouds, looking down upon him and judging him. He had destroyed the family bloodline and doomed all of Barovia. The castle and the valley were spirited away, locked in a demiplane surrounded on all sides by deadly fog. For Strahd and his people, there would be no escape.": "屠杀守卫后，斯特拉赫特在雷云中看到了父亲和母亲的脸，他们俯视着他，对他进行审判。他破坏了家族的血统，注定了整个巴罗维亚的命运。城堡和山谷被带走了，被锁在一个半位面，四面都被致命的雾气包围。对于斯特拉赫特和他的子民来说，他们将无法逃脱。",
	"Strahd has been the master of Ravenloft for centuries now. Since becoming a vampire, he has taken several consorts—none as beloved as Tatyana, but each a person of beauty. All of them he turned into vampire spawn. Although he feeds on the hapless souls of Barovia, they provide little nourishment and no comfort. From time to time, strangers from faraway lands are brought to his domain, to play the vampire's game of cat-and-mouse. Strahd savors these moments, for though these strangers offer him no lands to conquer, they aren't so easily destroyed and therefore provide a welcome diversion.": "斯特拉赫成为雷文洛夫特的主人已经有几个世纪了。自从成为吸血鬼后，他娶了几个妃子--没有一个像塔蒂亚娜那样受人爱戴，但每个人都很美丽。所有这些人都被他变成了吸血鬼的后代。虽然他以巴罗维亚的不幸灵魂为食，但他们没有提供什么营养，也没有安慰。不时有来自远方的陌生人被带到他的领地，与吸血鬼玩猫捉老鼠的游戏。斯特拉特喜欢这些时刻，因为虽然这些陌生人没有给他提供可以征服的土地，但他们不容易被摧毁，因此提供了一个受欢迎的转移。",
	"Strahd believes that the key to his escaping Barovia lies in finding someone worthy to rule in his stead, but his arrogance are so indomitable that no one is ever good enough in his eyes. He believes in his cold heart that only a von Zarovich as great as he or his father could sway the Dark Powers to release him.": "斯特拉特认为，他逃出巴罗维亚的关键在于找到一个值得代替他统治的人，但他的傲慢是如此不屈不挠，在他眼里，没有人是足够好的。他冷酷地认为，只有像他或他父亲那样伟大的冯-扎罗维奇才能动摇黑暗势力，释放他。",

	"Strahd has the following goals in the adventure.": "斯特拉赫在冒险中的目标如下。",
	"Strahd's unrequited love for Tatyana drove him to slay his brother, Sergei. Some time ago, Strahd glimpsed the young woman {@creature Ireena Kolyana|CoS} in the village of Barovia and felt extreme déjà vu. Ireena looked exactly like Tatyana! Strahd now believes that Ireena is the latest reincarnation of Tatyana, and thus he seeks to claim her.": "斯特拉特对塔季扬娜的单相思驱使他杀死了他的兄弟谢尔盖。前段时间，斯特拉赫特在巴罗维亚村瞥见了这位年轻女子{@creature Ireena Kolyana|CoS}，感到极度似曾相识。伊莲娜与塔季扬娜长得一模一样! 斯特拉特现在认为，伊莲娜是塔季扬娜的最新转世，因此他试图认领她。",
	"Strahd's evil courtship has led him to visit Ireena twice. On both occasions, he charmed his way into her home—the house of her adopted father, the burgomaster of the village of Barovia—and drank her blood. He intends to kill Ireena during their next meeting and turn her into his vampire spawn consort.": "斯特拉特的邪恶求爱使他两次访问伊莲娜。这两次，他都用魅力进入了她的家--她的养父，巴罗维亚村的村长的家，并喝了她的血。他打算在他们的下一次会面中杀了伊丽娜，把她变成他的吸血鬼卵子妃子。",
	"{@adventure Chapter 3|CoS|4} gives details about Ireena and where to find her in the village of Barovia.": "{@adventure Chapter 3|CoS|4}提供了关于伊丽娜的详细信息，以及在巴罗维亚村找到她的地方。",
	"Although he is usually focused on making {@creature Ireena Kolyana|CoS} his bride, Strahd has been distracted by reports that a legendary vampire hunter named Rudolph van Richten has come to Barovia. It takes more than one old man with a death wish to frighten Strahd; nevertheless, the vampire has his spies searching Barovia for van Richten. Strahd would like very much to meet the old vampire hunter, lock him in the dungeons of Castle Ravenloft, and slowly break his spirit.": "虽然他通常专注于制造{@creature Ireena Kolyana|CoS}他的新娘，但斯特拉赫特却被一个名叫鲁道夫-范-里希特的传奇吸血鬼猎人来到巴罗维亚的报告所干扰。要想吓唬住斯特拉赫特，可不仅仅是一个有死亡愿望的老人；尽管如此，这位吸血鬼还是让他的间谍在巴罗维亚寻找范里希特。斯特拉特非常想见到这位老吸血鬼猎人，把他关在雷文洛夫特城堡的地牢里，并慢慢打垮他的精神。",
	"{@adventure Chapter 5|CoS|6} describes the town of Vallaki, where van Richten currently resides incognito.": "{@adventure Chapter 5|CoS|6}描述了范里希特目前隐姓埋名居住的瓦拉基镇。",
	"Strahd can sense the arrival of new blood in his domain. When newcomers enter Barovia, he shifts his attention from {@creature Ireena Kolyana|CoS} and van Richten to his new guests so that he can determine whether any of them is worthy to be his successor or consort. (Eventually, he decides that none of them can replace him as master of Barovia, but he doesn't arrive at this conclusion immediately.)": "斯特拉特能感觉到他的领地里有新血的到来。当新人进入巴罗维亚时，他将注意力从{@creature Ireena Kolyana|CoS}和范里顿转移到新客人身上，以便确定他们中是否有人值得成为他的继承人或妃子。(最终，他决定他们中没有人能够取代他成为巴罗维亚的主人，但他并没有立即得出这个结论）。",
	"Strahd pays close attention to adventurers who are charismatic and arrogant, like himself. He focuses his attacks on them, to see how much they can withstand. If they crumble easily, he loses interest in them. If they exhibit great fortitude and defiance, his interest is piqued—even more so if the character displays uncommon knowledge or beauty. Such a person might not be worthy to succeed him, but the man or woman might provide amusement to Strahd as a new possession.": "斯特拉特密切关注那些像他一样有魅力和傲慢的冒险家。他集中攻击他们，看他们能承受多大的伤害。如果他们容易崩溃，他就对他们失去兴趣。如果他们表现出巨大的毅力和反抗精神，他的兴趣就会被激发出来--如果这个人物表现出不寻常的知识或美貌，他就更有兴趣了。这样的人可能不配继承他的事业，但这个人可能为斯特拉赫特提供娱乐，成为他的新财产。",
	"Strahd believes his soul is lost to evil. He feels neither pity nor remorse, neither love nor hate. He doesn't suffer anguish or wallow in indignation. He believes, and has always believed, that he is the master of his own fate.": "斯特拉特认为自己的灵魂已被邪恶所侵蚀。他既不怜悯也不悔恨，既不爱也不恨。他没有痛苦，也不沉湎于愤慨。他相信，而且一直相信，他是自己命运的主人。",
	"When he was alive, Strahd could admit to letting his emotions get the better of him from time to time. Now, as a vampire, he is more monster than man, with barely a hint of emotion left. He is above the concerns of the living. The only event that occasionally haunts him is the death of Tatyana, but his view of the past is bereft of romance or regret. In his mind, her death couldn't have been prevented, and what is done cannot be undone.": "活着的时候，斯特拉赫特可以承认，他时常会让自己的情绪变得更好。现在，作为一个吸血鬼，他与其说是人，不如说是怪物，几乎没有一丝情感。他超越了活人的关注。唯一偶尔困扰他的事件是塔季扬娜的死，但他对过去的看法是没有浪漫或遗憾。在他看来，她的死是无法避免的，而已经发生的事情是无法挽回的。",
	"In life, Strahd lived to conquer. In undeath, he conquers still—not realms, but people, driving good souls to become corrupt and destroying those who won't yield. Characters who try to appeal to Strahd's humanity will be gravely disappointed, because there is little humanity left in him. If they ask Strahd why he's preying on {@creature Ireena Kolyana|CoS}, he tells them that Ireena's body is the host for Tatyana's soul, and Tatyana's soul belongs to him.": "生前，斯特拉赫特以征服为生。在死后，他仍在征服--不是王国，而是人，驱使善良的灵魂变得堕落，摧毁那些不愿屈服的人。试图迎合斯特拉赫特的人性的角色会大失所望，因为他身上已经没有什么人性了。如果他们问斯特拉赫特为什么要捕食{@creature Ireena Kolyana|CoS}，他会告诉他们，伊莲娜的身体是塔蒂亚娜灵魂的宿主，而塔蒂亚娜的灵魂属于他。",
	"Strahd can be seductive and subtle when he chooses to be, especially if a person is clever or attractive. Men and women of beauty and cunning amuse Strahd for a time—playthings to possess or discard as he desires.": "如果斯特拉赫特愿意，他可以很有诱惑力，特别是当一个人很聪明或很有吸引力时。美貌和狡猾的男人和女人会让斯特拉赫特暂时感到高兴，他可以按照自己的意愿占有或抛弃这些东西。",
	"If he senses a lack of cohesion in a party of adventurers, he preys on that weakness and tries to drive a wedge between the characters by promising to help one at the expense of another. If Strahd senses evil in a person, he cultivates that tendency by offering to turn that character into a full-fledged vampire after helping Strahd destroy the rest of the party. Ultimately, Strahd doesn't honor his promise, instead turning the character into a vampire spawn under his control.": "如果他感觉到冒险者队伍缺乏凝聚力，他就会利用这一弱点，通过承诺帮助一个人而牺牲另一个人，试图在角色之间制造隔阂。如果斯特拉赫特察觉到一个人的邪恶，他就会培养这种倾向，在帮助斯特拉赫特消灭队伍的其他成员后，将该角色变成一个成熟的吸血鬼。最终，斯特拉赫特没有兑现他的承诺，而是将该人物变成了受他控制的吸血鬼卵。",
	"Strahd isn't a villain who remains out of sight until the final scene. Far from it—he travels as he desires to any place in his realm or his castle, and (from his perspective) the more often he encounters the characters, the better. The characters can and should meet him multiple times before the final encounter, which most likely takes place in the location determined by the card reading. His combat details are available in {@area appendix D|7c1|x}.": "斯特拉特并不是一个直到最后一幕才会消失的反派。远非如此，他可以随心所欲地前往他的王国或他的城堡中的任何地方，而且（从他的角度来看）他与人物相遇的次数越多越好。在最后的相遇之前，角色们可以而且应该多次遇到他，而最后的相遇很可能发生在读牌所决定的地点。他的战斗细节可在（%0%）中找到。",
	"When Strahd wants to terrorize the characters, he pays them a visit, either under the cloak of night or beneath overcast skies during the day.

Strahd and his minions never attack Ireena.": "当斯特拉赫特想恐吓角色时，他就会拜访他们，要么在夜幕下，要么在白天的阴霾天空下。如果他们在室内，他就会试图迷惑或诱导一个角色邀请他进去（如果他的吸血鬼后代在场，也会邀请他们）。斯特拉特和他的爪牙从不攻击伊莲娜。",
	"These encounters are meant to test the characters, not kill them. After a few rounds of toying with them, Strahd and his creatures withdraw. If the characters retreat, Strahd is likely to allow them to flee, savoring their fear and believing he has broken them.": "这些遭遇是为了测试角色，而不是杀死他们。在玩弄他们几轮后，斯特拉赫特和他的生物会撤退。如果角色撤退，斯特拉赫特可能会让他们逃走，品尝他们的恐惧，并认为他已经打破了他们。",

	"No matter which direction they go, the characters come to a lonely dirt road that cuts through the woods, leading to area A (see {@adventure chapter 2|CoS|3}).

	"The idyllic valley nestled in the Balinok Mountains was a slice of heaven to those who knew of its existence before Strahd's arrival. The serenity of the place was forever shattered when Strahd led a bloody crusade against the enemies of his family that ended here with the slaughter of hundreds. Struck by the scenic beauty of his most recent conquest and eager to escape the shadow of his father's legacy, Strahd made the valley his home and named it Barovia after the late King Barov, his father.": "对于那些在斯特拉赫特到来之前就知道其存在的人来说，依偎在巴里诺克山的田园谷地是一片天堂。当斯特拉赫特率领血腥的十字军东征，打击其家族的敌人时，这里的宁静被永远打破了，数百人在这里被屠杀。斯特拉特被他最近征服的美景所震撼，并渴望摆脱他父亲遗产的阴影，他把这个山谷作为自己的家，并以他父亲已故的巴罗夫国王命名为巴罗维亚。",
	"The land now called Barovia is no longer part of the world that Strahd once tried to conquer. It now exists within a demiplane formed by Strahd's consciousness and surrounded by a deadly fog. No creature can leave without Strahd's permission, and those that try become lost in the mist.": "现在被称为巴罗维亚的土地已经不再是斯特拉赫特曾经试图征服的世界的一部分。它现在存在于由斯特拉赫特的意识形成的半位面中，被致命的雾气所包围。没有斯特拉赫特的允许，任何生物都无法离开，而那些试图离开的人则会迷失在雾中。",
	"Strahd allows the Vistani to come and go as they please because he admires their lust for life and their willingness to serve him when he needs them. He also owes an ancient debt to the Vistani people. As a soldier centuries ago, he suffered a grievous injury in battle, and the Vistani tended his wounds and returned him safely to his family without making any demand for payment. The Vistani claim to possess potions that allow them to leave Strahd's domain, but the potions are false concoctions with no magical power. Nevertheless, the Vistani are willing to sell them for a hefty price.": "斯特拉特允许维斯坦人来去自如，因为他欣赏他们对生命的渴望，以及他们在他需要时愿意为他服务。他还欠着维斯坦人一笔古老的债务。几个世纪前，作为一名士兵，他在战斗中受了重伤，维斯坦人为他疗伤，并将他安全送回了家，没有提出任何报酬要求。维斯坦人声称拥有能让他们离开斯特拉赫特领地的药水，但这些药水是虚假的混合物，没有神奇的力量。尽管如此，维斯坦人还是愿意以高价出售。",
	"Native Barovians have been terrorized for centuries by the one they call \"the devil Strahd.\" Only a handful of them have the will to oppose him. Barovians congregate in the valley's three main settlements—the villages of Barovia and Krezk and the town of Vallaki—for fear of falling prey to wolves and other beasts that prowl the woods. Among these people are the Keepers of the Feather, a secret society of wereravens. Not powerful enough to defeat Strahd on their own, the Keepers readily assist adventurers who find themselves drawn into Strahd's domain.": "巴罗维亚本地人被他们称为 \"魔鬼斯特拉赫特 \"的人恐吓了几个世纪。他们中只有少数人有意愿反对他。巴罗维亚人聚集在山谷中的三个主要定居点--巴罗维亚和克雷兹克村以及瓦拉基镇，因为他们害怕成为狼和其他在森林中游荡的野兽的猎物。在这些人中，有一个由狼人组成的秘密社团 \"羽毛守护者\"。守护者的力量不足以单独击败斯特拉赫，他们很乐意帮助那些被卷入斯特拉赫领域的冒险者。",

	"The evergreen trees of the Svalich Woods climb the sides of the mountains that enclose the valley. The largest of these peaks is Mount Baratok, with its snow-covered cap and rugged slopes. Baratok's slightly smaller twin, Mount Ghakis, is mostly bald with tufts of trees here and there. Between these two mountains stands Lake Zarovich, which is fed by streams of ice-cold water pouring down the face of Mount Baratok. On the south side of the lake rests the town of Vallaki, enclosed by a palisade. West of the two mountains, atop a hill, stands the Abbey of Saint Markovia, around which the Barovians built a walled village named Krezk. Between Vallaki and Krezk lie the ruins of Argynvostholt, the fallen bastion of a knightly order called the Order of the Silver Dragon, wiped out by Strahd and his army. East of the mountains lies the village of Barovia, shrouded in mist and bereft of walls and defenses. The dark silhouette of Castle Ravenloft looks down on this village from its perch atop a 1,000-foot-high column of rock known as the Pillarstone of Ravenloft.": "斯瓦利奇森林的常青树爬上了包围山谷的山的两侧。这些山峰中最大的是巴拉托克山，山顶白雪覆盖，山坡崎岖。巴拉托克山的孪生兄弟加基斯山略小，大部分是光秃秃的，这里和那里都有一丛丛的树木。在这两座山之间矗立着扎罗维奇湖，湖水从巴拉托克山的山面倾泻而下，冰冷无比。湖的南面是瓦拉基镇，由栅栏围住。在这两座山的西边，在一座山顶上，矗立着圣马科维亚修道院，巴罗维亚人在其周围建造了一个名为克雷兹克的围墙村庄。在瓦拉基和克雷兹克之间是阿金沃斯霍尔特的废墟，这是一个名为银龙骑士团的堕落堡垒，被斯特拉赫和他的军队消灭了。山脉以东是巴罗维亚（Barovia）村，笼罩在迷雾之中，没有城墙和防御设施。拉文洛夫特城堡（Castle Ravenloft）的黑暗轮廓从1000英尺高的石柱上俯视着这个村庄，它被称为拉文洛夫特的柱石。",

	"A creature that starts its turn in the fog must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of {@condition exhaustion} (see {@book appendix A|PHB|11} in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}).

	"Nevertheless, Strahd and his vampire spawn tend to stay indoors most of the day and venture out at night, and they are subject to sunlight created by magic.": "尽管如此，斯特拉赫特和他的吸血鬼后代往往白天大部分时间呆在室内，晚上则冒险外出，他们会受到魔法产生的阳光照射。",
	"The land of Barovia resides in its own demiplane, isolated from all other planes, including the Material Plane. No spell—not even {@spell wish}—allows one to escape from Strahd's domain. {@spell Astral projection}, {@spell teleport}, {@spell plane shift}, and similar spells cast for the purpose of leaving Barovia simply fail, as do effects that banish a creature to another plane of existence. These restrictions apply to magic items and artifacts that have properties that transport or banish creatures to other planes. Magic that allows transit to the Border Ethereal, such as the {@spell etherealness} spell and the Etherealness feature of incorporeal undead, is the exception to this rule. A creature that enters the Border Ethereal from Strahd's domain is pulled back into Barovia upon leaving that plane.": "巴罗维亚位于自己的半位面，与所有其他位面（包括物质位面）隔绝。没有任何法术--甚至是{@spell wish}--能让人逃离斯特拉赫特的领域。(1%)、(2%)、(3%)和类似的法术，如果是为了离开巴罗维亚而施放的，都会失败，把生物放逐到另一个位面的效果也一样。这些限制适用于具有将生物传送或放逐到其他位面的属性的魔法物品和神器。允许传送到边界虚空的魔法，例如(4%)咒语和无体亡灵的虚空特性，是这个规则的例外。从斯特拉赫的领域进入边界虚空的生物在离开该位面时将被拉回巴罗维亚。",
	"For the purpose of spells whose effects change across or are blocked by planar boundaries (such as {@spell sending}), Strahd's domain is considered its own plane. Magic that summons creatures or objects from other planes functions normally in Barovia, as does magic that involves an extradimensional space.

	"While in Barovia, characters who receive spells from deities or otherworldly patrons continue to do so. In addition, spells that allow contact with beings from other planes function normally—with one proviso: Strahd can sense when someone in his domain is casting such a spell and can choose to make himself the spell's recipient, so that he becomes the one who is contacted.": "在巴罗维亚时，从神灵或其他世界的赞助人那里接受法术的角色继续这样做。此外，允许与其他位面的生命接触的法术也正常运作--但有一个条件。斯特拉特可以感觉到他的领域内有人在施展这样的法术，并可以选择让自己成为法术的接受者，这样他就会成为被联系的人。",
	"At your discretion, a spell can be modified cosmetically to enhance the horrific atmosphere. Here are examples:": "根据你的判断，可以对咒语进行外观上的修改，以增强恐怖的气氛。下面是一些例子。",

	"When a humanoid who has been dead for at least 24 hours returns to life, either by way of a spell or some supernatural means, it gains a random form of indefinite madness brought on by the realization that its spirit is trapped in Barovia, likely forever.

	"After his armies occupied the valley and slew its inhabitants, Strahd repopulated the area with human subjects drawn from his other conquered lands. As a result, Barovians have a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds.": "在他的军队占领山谷并杀害其居民后，斯特拉赫特用从他的其他被征服的土地上抽调的人类臣民重新填充该地区。因此，巴罗维亚人有各种各样的种族背景。",
	"Barovians are deeply invested in their homes and their traditions. They are wary of strange peoples and customs. The way Barovians deal with strangers can be unsettling to those newcomers. Barovians have a tendency to stare openly, in silence, thereby expressing their disapproval of anything that isn't familiar to them. Barovians aren't talkative with strangers, to the extent of being pointedly rude. Most Barovians have violent tempers that boil up through their customary silence when they are provoked. They also have a social cohesiveness (thrust upon them by their weird circumstances) that can make them act together against outsiders if a Barovian is mistreated.": "巴罗维亚人对他们的家园和传统有着深厚的感情。他们对陌生的民族和习俗保持警惕。巴罗维亚人与陌生人打交道的方式会让那些新来者感到不安。巴罗维亚人有一种在沉默中公开凝视的倾向，从而表达了他们对任何不熟悉的事物的不认可。巴罗维亚人对陌生人不善言辞，甚至到了尖锐无礼的程度。大多数巴罗维亚人都有暴躁的脾气，当他们被激怒时，会通过习惯性的沉默而沸腾起来。他们也有一种社会凝聚力（由他们奇怪的环境推给他们的），如果一个巴罗维亚人受到虐待，他们会一起行动起来反对外来者。",
	"Barovians were a happy people once, but their history and current conditions aren't pleasant. If one manages to win the trust of a Barovian, one has a friend for life and a stalwart ally.": "巴罗维亚人曾经是一个幸福的民族，但他们的历史和目前的状况并不令人愉快。如果一个人设法赢得了巴罗维亚人的信任，他就有了一个终身的朋友和一个坚定的盟友。",

They experience little hope or joy, and they are taught to fear the devil Strahd above all.": "巴罗维亚的孩子并不是快乐的孩子。他们在恐惧的文化中长大，一次又一次地被告知不要离家太远或进入森林。他们很少体验到希望或快乐，他们被教导要敬畏恶魔斯特拉赫特。",
	"Barovian adults eke out modest livings. With no new wealth pouring into the valley, they trade in old coins that bear the profile of their dark lord, Strahd, as he looked when he was alive. They hide their precious baubles in their houses and dress plainly outdoors, so as not to attract the attention of Strahd or his spies.": "巴罗维亚的成年人只能勉强维持生计。由于没有新的财富涌入山谷，他们以旧币交易，这些旧币上印有他们的黑暗主宰斯特拉赫特活着时的轮廓。他们把珍贵的饰品藏在家里，在户外穿着朴素，以免引起斯特拉赫特或其间谍的注意。",
	"Barovians live within a closed ecosystem. Every Barovian adult is expected to learn a trade or serve a function. Barovians stitch their own clothing, craft their own furniture, grow their own food, and make their own wine. With fewer than three thousand people living in the entire valley, finding the perfect mate isn't easy, so Barovians have learned to settle for what they can get.": "巴罗维亚人生活在一个封闭的生态系统中。每个巴罗维亚的成年人都被期望学习一门手艺或担任一种职能。巴罗维亚人自己缝制衣服，制作自己的家具，种植自己的食物，酿造自己的葡萄酒。整个山谷里只住了不到三千人，要找到完美的伴侣并不容易，所以巴罗维亚人已经学会了满足于他们能得到的东西。",
