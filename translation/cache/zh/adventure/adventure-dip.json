In the Realms, knights dare the crypts of the fallen dwarf kings of Delzoun, seeking glory and treasure. Rogues prowl the dark alleyways of teeming cities such as Neverwinter and Baldur's Gate. Clerics in the service of gods wield mace and spell, questing against the terrifying powers that threaten the land.

	"On the roads and rivers of the Realms travel minstrels and peddlers, merchants and guards, soldiers and sailors. Steel-hearted adventurers from backcountry farmsteads and sleepy villages follow tales of strange, glorious, faraway places. Good maps and clear trails can take even an inexperienced youth with dreams of glory far across the world, but these paths are never safe. Fell magic and deadly monsters are the perils one faces when traveling in the Realms. Even farms and freeholds within a day's walk of a city can fall prey to monsters, and no place is safe from the sudden wrath of a dragon.": "在王国的道路和河流上，游吟诗人和小贩、商人和卫兵、士兵和水手。来自乡间农庄和沉睡村庄的铁石心肠的冒险家们追寻着奇怪的、光荣的、遥远的地方的故事。好的地图和清晰的小路甚至可以把一个没有经验的青年带向世界的远方，但这些道路从来都不安全。坠落的魔法和致命的怪物是人们在王国中旅行时面临的危险。即使是离城市只有一天路程的农场和土地，也可能成为怪物的猎物，没有一个地方可以避免龙的突然发怒。",
	"The map below shows a region of the Forgotten Realms called the Sword Coast. This is a place of adventure, where daring souls delve into ancient strongholds and explore the ruins of long-lost kingdoms.

	"This city was badly damaged when Mount Hotenow erupted some fifty years ago. Now, the City of Skilled Hands works to rebuild under the watchful eye of its Lord Protector, Dagult Neverember, who rules in the absence of an heir to Neverwinter's crown.

Lord Neverember, taking no chances, quietly pays off or disposes of anyone claiming a connection to the rulers of old.": "这座城市在大约五十年前霍特诺火山爆发时遭到了严重破坏。现在，\"巧手之城 \"在其保护者达古特-纽文伯的注视下努力重建，他在永夜城王室没有继承人的情况下进行统治。目前，老阿拉贡达王室的合法继承人并不存在，许多人认为这一血统已经结束。Neverember勋爵不抱任何侥幸心理，悄悄地收买或处理任何声称与旧统治者有联系的人。",

The hills are haunted by ruthless barbarian tribes, giving others little reason to visit the area.": "这片岩石山丘的范围之所以被命名，是因为该地区在数千年来一直是一些流星雨的撞击地点。这些山丘被无情的野蛮人部落所困扰，使其他人没有理由访问这个地区。",

	"Dungeons & Dragons is a game that requires several hours to play, but you can stop the game at any time and continue it later. The first session should focus on character creation—one of the most fun aspects of the game.

	"During character creation, your role as the DM is to let your players build the characters they want, and to help them come up with explanations for how their characters came together to form an adventuring party.

The backgrounds they choose define who their characters were before becoming adventurers, and also include roleplaying hooks in the form of ideals, bonds, and flaws—things that you, as the DM, want to know. For example, if a player chooses the Criminal background, one of the options for the character's bond is, \"I'm trying to pay off an old debt I owe to a generous benefactor.\" If that's the character's bond, work with the player to decide who that generous benefactor is.": "当你的玩家按照规则手册中的步骤进行角色创建时，要注意他们的选择。他们选择的背景决定了他们的角色在成为冒险家之前的身份，也包括以理想、纽带和缺陷为形式的角色扮演钩子--这些都是你，作为DM，想要知道的。例如，如果一个玩家选择了犯罪背景，那么角色的纽带选项之一就是：\"我正在努力偿还我欠一位慷慨的恩人的旧债。\" 如果这是该角色的纽带，请与该玩家一起决定谁是那个慷慨的恩人。",
	"If you have two or more players, the easiest way to start the adventure is to assume that the characters know each other and have some sort of history together, however brief that history might be.
