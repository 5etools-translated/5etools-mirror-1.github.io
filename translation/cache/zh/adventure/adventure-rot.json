	"{@i Tyranny of Dragons} tells an epic story spanning two adventures, {@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ} and {@i The Rise of Tiamat}—the two tales contained within this collection. Both adventures are introduced here, outlining their backgrounds, plots, and fundamental ties, followed by details on allies and villains relevant to both adventures. Regardless of which adventure you're running, this overview provides useful information, applicable to the wider campaign and helpful for foreshadowing the threats unleashed by the Cult of the Dragon.": "{@i Tyranny of Dragons}讲述了一个跨越两个冒险的史诗故事，即{@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}和{@i The Rise of Tiamat}--这套书中的两个故事。这里介绍了两个冒险，概述了它们的背景、情节和基本联系，然后是与两个冒险有关的盟友和反派的细节。无论你在进行哪一个冒险，这个概述都提供了有用的信息，适用于更广泛的战役，并有助于预示龙之教所释放的威胁。",
	"{@i Tyranny of Dragons} is set in the Forgotten Realms on Faerûn's western shore—the Sword Coast. A thin strip of civilization stretches down this coast, where widely spaced cities are arranged like beads on a string. Roads loosely connect the cities that stretch from Luskan in the north to Calimport in the south, passing through Neverwinter, Waterdeep, Baldur's Gate, and other ports along the way. The bulk of this adventure takes place on the stretch between Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter.": "{@i Tyranny of Dragons}的背景是被遗忘的领域，在Faerûn的西海岸--剑海岸。一条细长的文明带沿着这个海岸线延伸，那里的城市像串珠子一样排列着。道路松散地连接着从北部的卢斯坎到南部的卡林波特的城市，沿途经过永夜城、水底城、博德之门和其他港口。这场冒险的大部分内容发生在博德之门和永夜之间的路段。",
	"You can play this adventure with just the Dungeons & Dragons basic rules and the {@i Tyranny of Dragons} appendix online, which contains all the monsters and magic items not described in this book. Both of these supplements are available as free downloads on {@link DungeonsandDragons.com|https://dnd.wizards.com}.": "你可以只用《龙与地下城》的基本规则和网上的{@i Tyranny of Dragons}附录来玩这个冒险，其中包含了本书中没有描述的所有怪物和魔法物品。这两个附录都可以在{@link DungeonsandDragons.com|https://dnd.wizards.com}上免费下载。",
	"{@i Tyranny of Dragons} tells an epic story across two adventures, of which {@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ} is the first. Characters begin this adventure at 1st level; by the end of it they should be 7th or 8th level and ready to continue with {@i The Rise of Tiamat}. The ideal party size is four characters. If your group is larger or smaller, you can adjust the adventure's difficulty by adjusting the number of enemies in each encounter.": "{@i Tyranny of Dragons}通过两个冒险讲述了一个史诗般的故事，其中{@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}是第一个。角色从1级开始冒险；在冒险结束时，他们应该是7级或8级，并准备好继续进行{@i The Rise of Tiamat}。理想的队伍规模是四个角色。如果你的队伍人数较多或较少，你可以通过调整每个遭遇中的敌人数量来调整冒险的难度。",
	"At your option, you can use the milestone experience rule. Under this rule, you pick events in the campaign that cause the characters to level up. In {@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}, the characters gain a level after completing each chapter except chapter 5.": "根据你的选择，你可以使用里程碑式的经验规则。在这个规则下，你在战役中挑选事件，使角色的等级提高。在{@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}中，人物在完成每一章后都会获得一个等级，第五章除外。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon has been active in Faerûn for centuries. It has focused on making undead dragons to fulfill a prophecy most of that time, but that's changing.": "龙的崇拜在法鲁恩已经活跃了几个世纪。在那段时间里，它一直专注于制造不死龙来实现一个预言，但这正在改变。",
	"The new leader of the cult is a Calishite named {@creature Severin|RoT} Silrajin, who believes that real draconic knowledge and power belongs to living dragons, not undead ones.": "邪教的新领袖是一个名叫（%0%）西拉金的卡利希特人，他认为真正的龙族知识和力量属于活龙，而不是不死龙。",
	"{@creature Severin|RoT}'s ambition amused {@creature Tiamat|RoT}, so she revealed the existence of five dragon masks to him—one for each chromatic dragon color. Individually, these ancient masks allow wearers to communicate with dragons. More importantly, a person who is erudite in draconic lore becomes a wyrmspeaker while wearing the mask, which allows the wearer to think like a dragon, gain favor among dragons, and subtly influence their behavior. When all five are brought together, they magically merge into a single Mask of the Dragon Queen. With the assembled mask, the cult can release {@creature Tiamat|RoT} from her prison in the Nine Hells.": "{@creature Severin|RoT}的雄心壮志让{@creature Tiamat|RoT}感到高兴，所以她向他透露了五个龙面具的存在--一个代表每种色泽的龙。单独来看，这些古老的面具允许佩戴者与龙交流。更重要的是，一个精通龙族传说的人在戴上面具后会成为一个巫师，这让佩戴者能够像龙一样思考，在龙族中获得青睐，并巧妙地影响他们的行为。当所有五个人被聚集在一起时，他们会神奇地合并成一个龙后的面具。有了组装好的面具，邪教可以把{@creature Tiamat|RoT}从她在九层地狱的监狱中释放出来。",
	"After {@creature Severin|RoT} (subtly guided by {@creature Tiamat|RoT}) discovered that secret, he bent all the cult's resources to finding the long-lost dragon masks in their secret hiding places. When he recovered the red mask, {@creature Severin|RoT} became the first of the wyrmspeakers, but others soon followed.": "在{@creature Severin|RoT}（在{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的巧妙引导下）发现了这个秘密后，他将邪教的所有资源用于寻找失传已久的龙面具的秘密藏身处。当他找到红色面具时，{@creature Severin|RoT}成为第一个讲巫术的人，但其他人很快就跟上了。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon has kept secret its goal to bring {@creature Tiamat|RoT} into the world thus far. Many know of the cult's increased activity along the Sword Coast, especially in the north, but the reasons behind the resurgence are unknown.": "迄今为止，神龙教一直对其将（%0%）带入世界的目标保密。许多人都知道该邪教在剑海岸一带的活动有所增加，尤其是在北部，但其复苏背后的原因却不得而知。",
	"Besides his cultists, {@creature Severin|RoT} has forged an alliance with a splinter faction of the Red Wizards of Thay. This small and secretive group, led by an outcast named Rath Modar, plots to unseat the lich Szass Tam from his position over the Red Wizards. Rath believes that in exchange for his help in releasing {@creature Tiamat|RoT}, she will grant him the power he needs to overthrow Szass Tam.": "除了他的崇拜者，{@creature Severin|RoT}还与泰伊红袍巫师的一个分裂派别结成联盟。这个小而隐秘的团体由一个名叫拉斯-莫达尔（Rath Modar）的弃儿领导，计划将巫师萨斯-塔姆（Szass Tam）从他在红袍巫师的位置上赶下来。拉斯认为，作为释放{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的交换条件，她会给予他所需的力量来推翻萨斯-谭。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon is organized in cells, which vary in size from just a handful of members to scores. Leaders in the cult are known as Wearers of Purple, and they outrank normal cultists, but no formal grades exist within the ranks of the Wearers of Purple.": "神龙教是以小组为单位组织的，小组的规模从几名成员到几十名成员不等。邪教中的领袖被称为 \"穿紫 \"者，他们的地位高于普通的邪教成员，但在 \"穿紫 \"者的队伍中没有正式的等级。",
	"Although the cult uses regalia in its rituals and its distant camps, members who operate in public places dress and act no differently from anyone else.": "尽管该邪教在其仪式和远处的营地中使用礼服，但在公共场所活动的成员的穿着和行为与其他人没有区别。",
	"The cult is not above hiring mercenaries when it has special jobs to fulfill. Indeed, many of the \"cultists\" that characters encounter in the first three chapters of this adventure are working for pay.": "当邪教有特殊的工作需要完成时，它也会雇佣雇佣兵。事实上，在这次冒险的前三章中，角色们遇到的许多 \"邪教徒 \"都是为了报酬而工作。",
	"During the time covered by the first half of this adventure, the cult already has several of the five dragon masks. While the cult works to gain more, {@creature Severin|RoT} initiates the second part of his plan to release {@creature Tiamat|RoT}: recruiting dragons and assembling a treasure hoard worthy of the queen of evil dragons. These efforts draw the characters' attention to the cult.": "在本冒险的前半部分所涵盖的时间里，邪教已经拥有了五个龙面具中的几个。在邪教组织努力获得更多的时候，{@creature Severin|RoT}启动了他释放{@creature Tiamat|RoT}计划的第二部分：招募龙并组建一个配得上恶龙女王的宝库。这些努力吸引了人物对邪教的注意。",
	"The action begins when a town comes under attack by a dragon and its allies. Characters can intervene to save townsfolk, but not before attackers carry away an important scholar. While rescuing that captive from the raiders' camp, characters learn they are up against the Cult of the Dragon, and they have the chance to destroy a subterranean dragon hatchery that the cult guards.": "行动开始时，一个小镇受到一条龙及其盟友的攻击。角色们可以出面拯救镇民，但在袭击者带走一位重要学者之前。在从袭击者的营地中救出这个俘虏时，角色们得知他们的对手是龙的崇拜，他们有机会摧毁该崇拜所守护的地下龙孵化场。",
	"The hatchery provides clues to the cult's operation and sends the characters on a long journey northward.During that trip, they face threats from the cult and gain some unexpected allies within the Zhentarim, a shadowy organization with an unsavory history. North of Waterdeep, the cult's contraband is offloaded at a smuggler's den for shipment to a castle long ago abandoned.": "孵化场为邪教的运作提供了线索，并将人物送上了向北的漫长旅程。在这次旅程中，他们面临着来自邪教的威胁，并在Zhentarim（一个有着不光彩历史的阴暗组织）中获得了一些意外的盟友。在沃特迪普北部，邪教的违禁品在一个走私者的窝点被卸下，运往一个早已被遗弃的城堡。",
	"A portal beneath the castle connects to the stronghold of one of the cult's most powerful and most disgruntled members, Talis the White, who can become either a deadly enemy or a crucial collaborator to the characters. With or without Talis's help, the characters must get into a flying citadel that a cloud giant placed at the cult's disposal and prevent it from reaching its destination at the Well of Dragons.": "城堡下面的一个传送门连接到邪教最强大和最不满的成员之一--白衣塔利斯的据点，他既可以成为致命的敌人，也可以成为角色们的重要合作者。不管有没有塔利斯的帮助，角色们都必须进入一个云端巨人放置在邪教手中的飞行城堡，并阻止它到达龙之井的目的地。",
	"{@i The Rise of Tiamat} continues the tale of {@i Tyranny of Dragons}. Characters begin this adventure at 8th level, likely having attained that level through the events of the first volume, {@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}. By this adventure's conclusion, the characters should reach approximately 15th level. Four characters is the ideal party size. If your group is smaller than that, consider removing a few opponents from combat encounters. If the group is bigger, add opponents to the fights. Consider altering encounters for smaller groups to avoid overly tough battles.": "{@i The Rise of Tiamat}继续讲述了{@i Tyranny of Dragons}的故事。角色开始这次冒险时是8级，很可能是通过第一卷的事件达到了这个等级，{@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}。在这次冒险结束时，人物应该达到大约15级。四个角色是理想的聚会规模。如果你的队伍比这个人数少，可以考虑从战斗遭遇中删除一些对手。如果队伍比较大，就在战斗中增加对手。考虑为小团体改变遭遇战，以避免过于艰难的战斗。",
	"This adventure uses the milestone experience rule. Under this rule, completing certain events in the campaign causes the characters to level up. See \"{@area Advancement|028|x}\" later in this introduction.": "这个冒险使用了里程碑式的经验规则。在这个规则下，完成战役中的某些事件会使角色的等级提高。见本介绍后面的\"（%0%）\"。",
	"The time of dragons dawns. Calling upon ancient magic and a host of draconic allies, the Cult of the Dragon seeks to unleash {@creature Tiamat|RoT} from her prison in the Nine Hells. By bringing the Queen of Dragons bodily into the world, the cult plans to scour away their foes and usher in a new age of draconic dominance. So far, they've gathered great stores of treasure, forged an alliance with Thay to assist with performing the required summoning ritual, gathered the five dragon masks central to the ritual (see \"{@area Dragon Masks|009|x},\" below), and persuaded or cajoled many of the oldest and strongest evil dragons of Faerûn into supporting them.": "龙的时代来临了。召唤古老的魔法和大量的龙族盟友，龙的崇拜试图将{@creature Tiamat|RoT}从她在九层地狱的监狱中释放出来。通过将龙后带入世界，该教派计划扫除他们的敌人，并迎来一个龙族统治的新时代。到目前为止，他们已经收集了大量的财宝，与泰伊结成联盟，协助进行所需的召唤仪式，收集了仪式中最重要的五个龙面具（见下文\"{@area Dragon Masks|009|x}\"），并说服或劝说了许多法鲁恩最古老和最强大的恶龙支持他们。",
	"However, not everything has gone according to the cult's plans. The discovery of an alliance between the Cult of the Dragon and the Red Wizards of Thay has shaken the various factions aligned against both organizations. The Harpers view any such alliance as an abomination, as does the Order of the Gauntlet. The Lords' Alliance recognizes the obvious threat to the lands and rulers of the Sword Coast and the North, while the Emerald Enclave suspects that anything Thay promotes is likely against the natural order. Even the Zhentarim fear the union of two such powerful forces.": "然而，并非一切都按照邪教的计划进行。发现神龙教和泰伊的红袍巫师之间的联盟，动摇了与这两个组织结盟的各个派别。哈珀人认为任何这样的联盟都是可憎的，高塔骑士团也是如此。领主联盟认识到对剑海岸和北方的土地和统治者的明显威胁，而翡翠飞地则怀疑泰伊所提倡的任何东西都可能违反自然秩序。甚至赞塔林也害怕两个如此强大的势力的联合。",
	"News of the alliance has thus brought the various factions of the Sword Coast together. The leaders of those factions understand that they must gather and rally forces to fight the cult, even as the situation in Faerûn grows more dire. Abductions and raids undertaken by the Cult of the Dragon increase daily, and refugees are fleeing from burned-out regions under cult attack to major cities and fortresses. Villagers have abandoned their homes, fleeing the constant predation of dragons. In many cities, all-out panic has created a growing movement in favor of agreeing to the cult's demands in the hope of winning concessions in return. It is difficult to muster troops when people are afraid they will be burned by dragonfire. This is a time for heroes to inspire the people of the Sword Coast with a great victory or two. Fortunately, the Forgotten Realms has just such a group of heroes.": "因此，联盟的消息让剑海岸的各个派别走到了一起。这些派别的领导人明白，他们必须聚集和集结力量来对抗邪教，即使法鲁恩的局势变得更加严峻。神龙教的绑架和袭击每天都在增加，难民们正从被邪教攻击的烧毁地区逃往主要城市和堡垒。村民们放弃了他们的家园，以逃避龙的不断掠夺。在许多城市，全面的恐慌产生了一个日益增长的运动，赞成同意邪教的要求，希望能赢得让步的回报。当人们害怕他们会被龙火烧死时，很难召集军队。这是一个英雄们用一两个伟大的胜利来鼓舞剑海岸人民的时刻。幸运的是，被遗忘的国度就有这样一群英雄。",
	"In the first volume of {@i Tyranny of Dragons}, the Cult of the Dragon gathered up a hoard for {@creature Tiamat|RoT}—then lost a portion of that hoard when Skyreach Castle fell. All the while, the cult kept secret its goal of bringing back {@creature Tiamat|RoT} and its alliance with an exiled group of Red Wizards of Thay. The cult now needs only to gather enough sacrifices to power the ritual by which the dragon masks will open a portal to the Nine Hells, allowing {@creature Tiamat|RoT} to travel to the Material Plane.": "在{@i Tyranny of Dragons}的第一卷中，神龙教为{@creature Tiamat|RoT}收集了一个囤积物--然后在天际城堡陷落时失去了一部分囤积物。一直以来，该教派对其带回{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的目标以及与流亡的泰伊红袍巫师团体的联盟保密。邪教现在只需要收集足够的祭品，为龙面具打开通往九层地狱的入口的仪式提供能量，让{@creature Tiamat|RoT}能够前往物质世界。",
	"These plans continue to move ahead as the Thayan exile Rath Modar and his Red Wizards bring expertise in summoning magic to the cult, preparing a tremendous blood sacrifice to empower the ritual. The alliance between wizards and cultists is fragile, however, since neither side entirely trusts the promises of the other.": "这些计划继续向前推进，因为泰雅族的流亡者拉斯-莫达尔和他的红袍巫师为邪教带来了召唤魔法的专业知识，准备了一个巨大的血祭来增强仪式的力量。然而，巫师和邪教徒之间的联盟是脆弱的，因为双方都不完全相信对方的承诺。",
	"This second volume of {@i Tyranny of Dragons} assumes that the factions of good-aligned adventurers and the people of the Sword Coast are aware of the threat posed by the cult. What's unclear is how to deal with it. Depending on the nature of the characters and their relationships with the factions, different groups might recommend different courses of action to the heroes. It falls to the players to figure out how they want to proceed.": "这部《%0%》的第二卷假定善盟冒险者的派别和剑海岸的人们都知道邪教所带来的威胁。不清楚的是如何处理它。根据角色的性质以及他们与各派别的关系，不同的团体可能会向英雄们推荐不同的行动方案。这就需要玩家想出他们要如何进行。",
	"At the start this adventure, representatives of groups and factions from across the Sword Coast meet to discuss their concern about the Cult of the Dragon, and to draw up plans for opposing the cult. The adventurers are summoned to Waterdeep for a summit that will come to be known as the Council of Waterdeep (see {@area chapter 9|05f|x} for details).": "在这次冒险的开始，整个剑海岸的团体和派别的代表开会讨论他们对神龙教的关注，并制定了反对该教派的计划。冒险家们被召集到沃特迪普参加一个峰会，这个峰会将被称为沃特迪普议会（详见{@area chapter 9|05f|x}）。",
	"Four council sessions take place over the course of the adventure, naturally dividing events into four stages. Between the council gatherings, the characters undertake missions to thwart the cult's plans. Some of these missions will be proposed by NPCs (nonplayer characters) during council sessions. Others can be proposed by the characters. The adventurers understand that thousands of lives depend on their actions. The characters are among the greatest heroes of the Sword Coast, and the Council of Waterdeep looks to them for wise guidance and swift action.": "在冒险过程中会有四次议会会议，自然地将事件分为四个阶段。在理事会会议之间，角色们要执行任务来挫败邪教的计划。其中一些任务将由理事会会议期间的NPC（非玩家角色）提出。其他任务可以由角色提出。冒险家们明白，成千上万的生命都取决于他们的行动。这些角色是剑海岸最伟大的英雄之一，沃特德普议会期待他们提供明智的指导和迅速的行动。",
	"Many of the power groups represented on the council don't trust each other, and some even have conflicting goals. Over the course of the council's four meetings, the players and characters need to forge this disparate, feuding group into a coordinated force. Only with all factions working together and contributing to the overall effort can enough power be brought to bear against the cult to prevent {@creature Tiamat|RoT}'s return. The more successful the characters are in their actions against the cult, the more esteem and influence they gain with the council.": "理事会中的许多权力集团彼此不信任，有些甚至有冲突的目标。在委员会四次会议的过程中，玩家和角色需要将这个不相干的、有争执的团体打造成一个协调的力量。只有所有的派别一起工作并为整体努力做出贡献，才能有足够的力量来对抗邪教，阻止{@creature Tiamat|RoT}的回归。人物对邪教的行动越成功，他们在议会中获得的尊重和影响就越大。",
	"Events are arranged in this book in a logical sequence for staging {@i The Rise of Tiamat}, and the chapters are numbered for ease of reference. You can even add more chapters of your own devising, or which expand on ideas the players generate.": "本书中的事件是按照逻辑顺序安排的，便于上演（%0%），各章都有编号，便于参考。你甚至可以添加你自己设计的更多章节，或者对玩家产生的想法进行扩展。",
	"The events of {@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ} lead directly into {@i {@i The Rise of Tiamat}.} The shape of this adventure is defined by the meetings of the Council of Waterdeep, which divide the adventure into four stages.": "{@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}的事件直接导致了{@i {@i The Rise of Tiamat}。这场冒险的形式是由沃特德普议会的会议决定的，它将冒险分为四个阶段。",
	"The characters are invited by NPCs they know and trust to the first session of the Council of Waterdeep. (If you played {@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}, Leosin Erlanthar or Ontharr Frume are likely candidates.)": "角色被他们认识和信任的NPC邀请参加水底议会的第一次会议。（如果你玩过（%0%），Leosin Erlanthar或Ontharr Frume可能是候选人。）",
	"The adventurers learn the location of one of the cult's highest-ranking leaders—Wyrmspeaker {@creature Varram|RoT}. After discovering that {@creature Varram|RoT} is held captive by yuan-ti in the Serpent Hills, the characters can fight the yuan-ti and negotiate to take custody of the cultist.": "冒险家们得知了邪教最高级别的领袖之一--巫师（%0%）的位置。在发现(%%)被元老们囚禁在蛇山之后，冒险者们可以与元老们战斗，并通过谈判取得对该邪教者的监护。",
	"{@creature Maccath the Crimson|RoT}, a tiefling sorcerer of the Arcane Brotherhood, is an acknowledged expert on the {@item Draakhorn|RoT}—an ancient relic being used by the cult to summon dragons to their cause. She disappeared three years ago in the Sea of Moving Ice, where she is presently a prisoner of the white dragon Arauthator. The characters must make their way to Arauthator's iceberg lair and convince Maccath to join them. By driving away the dragon and carrying off valuable dragon lore, they deal a blow to the cult and might gain the Arcane Brotherhood as allies in the process.": "{@creature Maccath the Crimson|RoT}，一个奥术兄弟会的铁皮人巫师，是公认的{@item Draakhorn|RoT}专家--一个被邪教用来召唤龙的古老遗物，是他们的事业。她三年前在移动的冰海中失踪了，目前她被白龙Arauthator囚禁在那里。角色们必须前往Arauthator的冰山巢穴，说服Maccath加入他们。通过赶走龙并带走有价值的龙的传说，他们对邪教进行了打击，并可能在这个过程中获得奥术兄弟会的盟友。",
	"The cult's leaders aren't oblivious to the damage being caused by the heroes. Assassins try to stop the characters' interference, but the cultists misjudge the strength needed to complete the job.": "邪教的领导人并没有对英雄们造成的伤害视而不见。刺客们试图阻止人物的干扰，但邪教分子错误地判断了完成工作所需的力量。",
	"The characters regroup with the leaders of the Sword Coast's factions at the Council of Waterdeep, assessing their victories over the cult and planning the factions' next moves.": "角色们在沃特德普议会与剑海岸各派系的领袖重新聚集，评估他们对邪教的胜利，并计划各派系的下一步行动。",
	"The Emerald Enclave requests that the adventurers help them investigate the aftermath of cult raids led by a green dragon in the Misty Forest—a dragon possibly controlled by one of the cult's wyrmspeakers. That investigation leads to a showdown against the green dragon Chuth and Wyrmspeaker {@creature Neronvain|RoT}, who has a surprising connection to the council.": "翡翠飞地要求冒险家们帮助他们调查迷雾森林中绿龙领导的邪教袭击事件的后果--一条可能被邪教的一个巫师控制的龙。这项调查导致了与绿龙楚斯和巫师（%0%）的对决，而巫师与议会有着惊人的联系。",
	"The metallic dragons of the Sword Coast send word to the Council of Waterdeep that they wish to participate in the coming struggle. The adventurers are chosen to attend a council of dragons in the Sunset Mountains, pleading the humanoid factions' case to some of the oldest and most powerful creatures in Faerûn.": "剑海岸的金属龙向沃特德普的议会传话，说他们希望参与即将到来的斗争。冒险家们被选中参加落日山脉的龙族议会，向法鲁恩最古老、最强大的生物恳求人形派别的情况。",

	"At the third meeting of the Council of Waterdeep, the characters take lead roles in shaping the fight against the cult.": "在沃特德普议会的第三次会议上，这些人物在塑造打击邪教的斗争中发挥了主导作用。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon is not without its own internal strife, as the adventurers discover when a cultist contacts them with the offer to turn over one of the dragon masks essential to {@creature Severin|RoT}'s plans. The characters must infiltrate a cult stronghold and claim the mask, then save a nearby village from the blue dragon that means to take the relic back.": "当一个邪教分子与他们联系，提出交出对{@creature Severin|RoT}的计划至关重要的一个龙面具时，冒险者们发现，龙之教并非没有内部纷争。冒险家们必须潜入邪教的据点，夺取面具，然后从企图夺回遗物的蓝龙手中拯救附近的村庄。",
	"The ritual that will bring {@creature Tiamat|RoT} to Faerûn is too complex for the cult's spellcasters to perform without their {@creature Red Wizard|RoT} allies—all Thayan exiles. The adventurers travel to Thay to forge an alliance with the Red Wizards, whose lich lord Szass Tam hungers for revenge against the exiles. The Red Wizards of Thay are evil to the core, though, and the delegates must tread carefully as they present their case.": "这个仪式将把{@creature Tiamat|RoT}带到法鲁恩，对于邪教的施法者来说，如果没有他们的{@creature Red Wizard|RoT}盟友--所有泰雅族的流亡者，就无法完成这个仪式。冒险家们前往泰伊，与红袍巫师结成联盟，他们的巫师领主萨斯-塔姆渴望向流亡者复仇。不过，泰伊的红袍巫师们邪恶至极，代表们在陈述他们的理由时必须小心谨慎。",

A grim, dismal region spread across a towering plateau, Thay is defended by an army of undead warriors and ruled by the lich Szass Tam and the zulkirs he appoints to rule over the eight schools of magic. The Red Wizards of Thay are known across Faerûn, and are easily recognized by their distinctive crimson robes and the arcane sigils tattooed onto their shaved heads.

	"For many years, Szass Tam's grip on absolute power in Thay has been weakened by internal strife. Mortal Red Wizards have risen against their undead masters, destroying some of Szass Tam's lich zulkirs and thinning the ranks of other undead. Little is known of the conflict beyond Thay's borders, however. In this quiet civil war, both sides fear that too much attrition will make Thay a target for its long list of enemies. Szass Tam questions the allegiance of all living Red Wizards outside Thay, and has made it clear that death and worse await any who oppose him.": "多年来，萨斯-塔姆对泰伊绝对权力的控制由于内部纷争而被削弱了。凡人的红袍巫师们已经起来反对他们的亡灵主人，摧毁了萨斯-谭的一些巫师祖尔基尔，并削弱了其他亡灵的队伍。然而，人们对泰伊边界以外的冲突知之甚少。在这场平静的内战中，双方都担心过多的损耗会使泰伊成为其众多敌人的目标。萨斯-塔姆质疑泰伊之外所有活着的红袍巫师的忠诚度，并明确表示，任何反对他的人都将面临死亡和更坏的结果。",

The young, ambitious cult leader sought powerful magic to locate the scattered dragon masks and to perform the ritual that would summon {@creature Tiamat|RoT} from the Nine Hells.

Rath Modar hopes that {@creature Tiamat|RoT} will show her gratitude for the pivotal role he and his fellow Red Wizards played in her return, granting them an army of dragons with which to assault Thay. After unseating Szass Tam, Rath Modar plans to take his place at the head of all Red Wizards. Whether {@creature Tiamat|RoT} will grant such a reward—or have any further use for the Red Wizards at all—remains unknown.": "这个联盟的秘密基石是拉斯-莫达尔相信，一旦{@creature Tiamat|RoT}回来，她会看到红袍巫师是比那些忠诚但魔法薄弱的邪教徒更有用的盟友。拉斯-莫达尔希望{@creature Tiamat|RoT}会对他和他的红袍巫师同伴在她的回归中所扮演的关键角色表示感谢，给予他们一支龙的军队来攻击泰伊。在推翻萨斯-谭之后，拉斯-莫达尔计划取代他成为所有红袍巫师的首领。{@creature Tiamat|RoT}是否会给予这样的奖励，或者对红袍巫师有任何进一步的利用，目前还不得而知。",

The adventurers might thus find themselves making uneasy alliances with characters they would normally never trust, since the easiest and surest way to eliminate a {@creature Red Wizard|RoT} in service to the cult is to betray that wizard's location to an agent of Szass Tam. However, characters who get too close to Szass Tam's servants and his paranoid vendetta against the {@creature Red Wizard|RoT} exiles might find themselves at the mercy of the Thayans. This possibility is explored more fully in {@adventure chapter 16|RoT|7}.": "剑海岸上并不是每一个{@creature Red Wizard|RoT}都在为拉斯-莫达尔或神龙教工作。有些人追求自己的利益，有些人则是萨斯-谭的间谍。因此，冒险者们可能会发现自己与他们通常不会信任的人物结成了不安的联盟，因为消灭一个为邪教服务的（1%）的最简单和最肯定的方法就是将该巫师的位置出卖给萨斯-谭的特工。然而，那些过于接近萨斯-谭的仆人和他对流亡者（%2%）的偏执性仇杀的人物可能会发现自己受到了泰安人的摆布。这种可能性将在{@adventure chapter 16|RoT|7}中得到更充分的探讨。",

	"Ordinarily, the Cult of the Dragon has nothing to do with devils. However, releasing {@creature Tiamat|RoT} into the world is a massive undertaking, and {@creature Severin|RoT} has called on every resource he can. Though many of his allies among the Red Wizards are well schooled in summoning and commanding devils, doing so is never a straightforward process. Devils cannot leave the Nine Hells of their own accord, and though Asmodeus can bend these laws, he seldom does. Most devils in the Material Plane were summoned there by mortal mages who expended tremendous amounts of magical power to breach the barriers that separate the Nine Hells from other planes.": "通常情况下，神龙教与魔鬼没有任何关系。然而，将{@creature Tiamat|RoT}释放到这个世界上是一项巨大的工程，{@creature Severin|RoT}已经调用了他能调用的所有资源。虽然他在红袍巫师中的许多盟友在召唤和指挥魔鬼方面很有经验，但这样做绝不是一个简单的过程。魔鬼不能主动离开九层地狱，尽管阿斯摩德可以弯曲这些法律，但他很少这样做。物质界的大多数魔鬼都是由凡人法师召唤而来，他们耗费了巨大的魔力来突破九幽地狱与其他位面之间的障碍。",
	"Devils aren't numerous in {@i The Rise of Tiamat} until the final showdown at the Well of Dragons, but their presence elsewhere in the adventure (including the additional encounter \"Devilish Demands\") should make attentive players wonder at the connection between devils and dragons. Devils are supreme manipulators, and if the characters have the opportunity to speak with devils that aren't working for the cult, don't be afraid to offer them diabolical assistance. Such an offer should put all characters—not just those of good alignment—in a bind. Bargaining with devils is a fool's game, but if the alternative is the end of the world, it might be the adventurers' only option.": "在龙之井的最后决战之前，魔鬼的数量并不多（%0%），但是他们在冒险的其他地方的出现（包括额外的遭遇 \"魔鬼的要求\"）应该让细心的玩家对魔鬼和龙之间的联系感到好奇。魔鬼是最高的操纵者，如果角色有机会与不为邪教工作的魔鬼交谈，不要害怕向他们提供邪恶的帮助。这样的提议应该让所有的角色--不仅仅是那些有良好关系的角色--陷入困境。与魔鬼讨价还价是一个愚蠢的游戏，但是如果替代方案是世界末日，这可能是冒险家们的唯一选择。",

	"The Cult of the Dragon has a secret weapon for dealing with chromatic dragons, in the form of the five dragon masks. Even with a dragon mask, the process of influencing a dragon remains arduous and dangerous—though the payoff is enormous.

Dragons cannot be controlled by the masks, but they can be swayed by ideas and proposals that they would not normally find persuasive.": "神龙教有一个对付色龙的秘密武器，就是五个龙形面具。即使有了龙面具，影响龙的过程仍然是艰巨而危险的--尽管回报是巨大的。这些遗物赋予佩戴者与龙沟通的能力，但更重要的是，它们对龙施加了一种无法察觉的微妙影响。龙不能被面具控制，但它们可以被通常认为没有说服力的想法和建议所动摇。",

The shadow of a dragon could fall across the adventurers in the daytime, and dark draconic wings might momentarily blot out the moon at night. When the characters arrive in a settlement, they should hear stories about dragon sightings and attacks.

Chromatic dragons are evil and merciless, and every battle against these creatures should be a life-or-death struggle. No dragon should ever fall without the heroes suffering during the battle. Chromatic dragons use every possible advantage with no regard for fairness, and their chief advantage is flight. A dragon never fights on foot where enemies might hack at it when it can soar majestically out of reach and slaughter foes with its breath weapon. Only in its lair will a dragon typically engage in melee, and then only if its hoard is threatened.": "龙是Faerûn和《龙与地下城》游戏中最古老、最聪明、最强大的怪物之一。色素龙是邪恶和无情的，每一次与这些生物的战斗都应该是一场生死攸关的斗争。在战斗中，没有任何一条龙可以在英雄们不受伤害的情况下倒下。色素龙利用一切可能的优势，不顾公平，而它们的主要优势是飞行。龙从不在敌人可能砍杀它的地方步行作战，因为它可以雄伟地翱翔在敌人的视野之外，用它的呼吸武器屠杀敌人。只有在它的巢穴里，龙才会进行近战，而且只有在它的囤积物受到威胁时才会进行。",

	"In the first council meeting, Lord Dagult's resources have been spread thin between the massive investments he's made in rebuilding Neverwinter and in maintaining dominance in Waterdeep.

Like Ontharr Frume of the Order of the Gauntlet, Connerad responds well to bold demonstrations of heroism.

Though not an actual member of the Lords' Alliance, he is present at the Council of Waterdeep as the alliance's nominal representative for Daggerford. That small settlement can contribute little to the effort to defeat the Cult of the Dragon, however, and in truth, Isteval has been drafted by Cormyr to gain insight into what looks to be a war brewing on its western border.": "伊斯特瓦尔爵士是一位前冒险家和科米尔的紫龙骑士。虽然他不是领主联盟的实际成员，但他作为联盟名义上的达格福特代表出席了沃特德普的议会。然而，这个小定居点对打败龙之崇拜的努力贡献不大，事实上，伊斯特瓦尔被科米尔征召，以深入了解其西部边境上似乎正在酝酿的一场战争。",
	"Isteval has too much respect for the other delegates to hide this information from them, and he assures those present that his loyalties—to Daggerford, to Cormyr, to the Lords' Alliance, and to all good folk—are not at cross-purposes. This forthright approach nevertheless causes an uproar among other delegates, and the adventurers must take a hand in insuring that Isteval is not expelled from the council meetings.": "伊斯特瓦尔非常尊重其他代表，不会对他们隐瞒这些信息，他向在场的人保证，他对达格福特、科米尔、领主联盟和所有善良的人们的忠诚并不相悖。但这种直截了当的做法还是在其他代表中引起了骚动，冒险家们必须参与其中，以确保伊斯特瓦尔不被驱逐出议会会议。",
	"A veteran dragon slayer, Isteval bears a wound in his leg that resists magical healing, and he walks with a cane made from a bone of the green dragon that dealt him the injury. The paladin can be a helpful source of dragon lore, but his advice is always guarded. He sees his infirmity as a reminder from his god Lathander of the dangers of hubris. As befits his deity's ethos, Isteval has chosen to treat his injury as a reason to encourage the heroics of others even as his own legend fades. Still, at times like these when the world needs heroes, he doesn't like being reminded that he must watch the fight from the sidelines.": "作为一名资深的屠龙者，伊斯特瓦尔的腿上有一道伤口，可以抵抗魔法的治疗，他用一根绿龙的骨头做成的手杖行走。这位圣骑士可以成为龙的传说的有用来源，但他的建议总是受到保护。他认为自己的虚弱是他的神Lathander对傲慢的危险的一种提醒。与他的神的精神相称，伊斯特瓦尔选择把他的伤痛当作鼓励他人的英雄事迹的理由，即使他自己的传说已经消失。不过，在这种世界需要英雄的时候，他并不喜欢被提醒他必须在一旁观战。",
	"Isteval believes in heroes as the spark that can ignite the flames of righteousness in others and the light that chases away the darkness of evil. Seeing this spark in the adventurers makes the paladin one of the party's strongest advocates at the Council of Waterdeep, as long as they pursue a principled path.": "伊斯特瓦尔相信英雄是能够点燃他人正义之火的火花，是驱赶邪恶黑暗的光芒。看到冒险者身上的这种火花，使圣骑士成为党在沃特德普议会最有力的支持者之一，只要他们追求有原则的道路。",
	"Sir Isteval has much in common with Ontharr Frume of the Order of the Gauntlet. The two are potential allies in all things, which worries some of the other Lords' Alliance members.": "伊斯特瓦尔爵士与高塔骑士团的昂赛尔-弗鲁姆有很多共同点。两人在所有事情上都是潜在的盟友，这让其他一些领主联盟的成员感到担忧。",
	"The Zhentarim—also known as the Black Network—is a loose affiliation of merchants, mercenaries, and malefactors. Common folk know the Zhentarim as the people to talk to when you need the best guards or mercenaries money can buy. And if the cargo is shady or the cause you're fighting for is questionable or even unjust, the Zhentarim don't mind.": "Zhentarim--也被称为黑网--是一个由商人、雇佣兵和恶棍组成的松散联盟。普通人都知道，当你需要用钱买到最好的警卫或雇佣兵时，可以和Zhentarim谈谈。如果货物有问题，或者你为之奋斗的事业有问题，甚至是不公正的，Zhentarim也不会介意。",
	"Affiliation with the Zhentarim can be profitable to sellswords, thieves, and rogues of every stripe. It's plausible that adventurers in your campaign might become members of the organization—but like most residents of Faerûn, they won't know the full extent of the Zhentarim's operations and goals.": "隶属于Zhentarim的组织对各种类型的卖家、盗贼和流氓来说都是有利可图的。在你的活动中，冒险者有可能成为该组织的成员，但就像法鲁恩的大多数居民一样，他们并不了解Zhentarim的全部活动和目标。",
	"Unknown to all but a few, the heart of the Zhentarim is a cabal of evil and sometimes monstrous leaders who seek to extend the Black Network's blood-soaked reach into every assassination, black market, and illegal deal that happens in Faerûn. The order's criminal connections burrow into every major city and thieves' guild in the Western Heartlands and along the Sword Coast. Wherever a city's coinage is disastrously undermined by counterfeiting, wherever an up-and-coming business runs roughshod over its established competitors, and wherever a political struggle turns to widespread intimidation, it's a safe bet that the Zhentarim are involved.": "除了少数人之外，根塔林的核心是一个由邪恶的、有时是畸形的领导人组成的阴谋集团，他们试图将黑色网络的血腥触角延伸到法鲁恩的每一次暗杀、黑市和非法交易中。该组织的犯罪关系深入到西部心脏地带和剑海岸的每个主要城市和盗贼公会。每当一个城市的钱币因造假而遭到灾难性破坏，每当一个新兴企业对其成熟的竞争对手采取粗暴手段，每当一场政治斗争演变成广泛的恐吓，都可以肯定根塔林会参与其中。",
	"However, engaging in mainstream corruption and wanting to see {@creature Tiamat|RoT} ascendant are two different things. The Zhentarim have no illusions about what the Dragon Queen's return would mean for their plans. Wanting to secretly rule the world from the shadows for themselves, the leaders of the Black Network have no desire to become agents and errand-runners for some petty god and her dragon cohorts.": "然而，参与主流腐败和希望看到（%0%）升天是两回事。镇塔林对龙女王的回归对他们的计划意味着什么不抱幻想。想要从阴影中为自己秘密统治世界，黑网的领导人并不希望成为某个小神和她的龙族同伙的代理人和跑腿者。",
	"This viewpoint makes the Zhentarim an interesting addition to the characters' possible allies. Under normal circumstances, the Harpers, the Lords' Alliance, the Order of the Gauntlet, and the Emerald Enclave would shun ties to the Black Network—and possibly arrest its emissaries. However, the crisis created by the Cult of the Dragon is unprecedented. Every resource that can be mustered will be needed in the final showdown against the cult, and the Zhentarim's network of spies, assassins, and mercenary armies cannot be ignored.": "这种观点使赞塔林成为人物可能的盟友中一个有趣的补充。在正常情况下，哈珀人（Harpers）、领主联盟（Lords' Alliance）、高塔骑士团（Order of the Gauntlet）和翡翠飞地（Emerald Enclave）会回避与黑网的关系，并可能逮捕其使者。然而，神龙教造成的危机是空前的。在与该邪教的最后决战中，将需要每一种可以调动的资源，而镇塔林的间谍、刺客和雇佣军网络是不容忽视的。",
	"Even with the fate of the world and the Zhentarim's own future hanging in the balance, the order demands payment for services—and where need and risk are greatest, the pay is expected to be equally great. This mercenary attitude does not sit well with the Lords' Alliance, however, and they are the only group with the resources to pay the Black Network's price. The heroes can attempt to sway the opinions of the other factions—and have a chance to buy the Zhentarim's allegiance outright in the follow-up to {@adventure chapter 15|RoT|6}.": "即使世界的命运和Zhentarim自己的未来都岌岌可危，该组织仍要求为服务付费--在需求和风险最大的地方，报酬也会同样巨大。然而，这种雇佣兵的态度让领主联盟很不满意，他们是唯一有资源来支付黑网代价的团体。英雄们可以尝试动摇其他派别的意见--并且有机会在后续的{@adventure chapter 15|RoT|6}中直接买下赞塔林的效忠。",
	"In the end, too much is at stake to sit this fight out, and the Zhentarim pitch in against the cult regardless of whether their price is paid. However, if the other factions want a voice in how the Zhentarim go to war against the cult, it will cost them. If the Zhentarim fight on their own, they strike when and how they choose.": "最后，这场战斗的利害关系太大了，无论是否付出代价，Zhentarim都会投向邪教。然而，如果其他派别想在根塔林人如何与邪教开战的问题上有发言权，他们就会付出代价。如果Zhentarim独立作战，他们会在自己选择的时间和方式上进行打击。",
	"At least one Black Network mission is carried out regardless of payment. Without the knowledge of anyone outside the Zhentarim, one of their agents has infiltrated the cult and gets close enough to Wyrmspeaker {@creature Varram|RoT} to steal the {@i White Dragon Mask}. This theft sets off a sequence of events that culminates in {@creature Varram|RoT}'s portion of the \"{@adventure Death to the Wyrmspeakers|RoT|3}\" chapter.": "至少有一个黑网任务是不计报酬地进行的。在Zhentarim以外的人不知道的情况下，他们的一个特工已经渗透到了邪教，并接近了Wyrmspeaker（%0%），偷走了（%1%）。这次偷窃引发了一连串的事件，在\"{@adventure Death to the Wyrmspeakers|RoT|3} \"章节的{@creature Varram|RoT}部分达到高潮。",

Characters who played {@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ} have already met one member of the Black Network—the female gnome Jamna Gleamsilver. If the characters need information or gear they can't obtain any other way, seeking out or being approached by a Zhentarim agent is an easy way for you to provide it.": "黑网特工是有用的NPC，你可以在冒险过程中的适当时候介绍他们。玩过{@adventure Hoard of the Dragon Queen|HotDQ}的角色已经见过黑网的一个成员--女地精Jamna Gleamsilver。如果角色需要他们无法通过其他方式获得的信息或装备，寻找或被一个Zhentarim特工接近是你提供信息的一个简单方法。",
	"A typical Black Network agent is a highly capable adventurer with no scruples. Some Zhentarim have winged snake companions that carry messages on scrolls as they fly, allowing agents to keep in contact with one another.": "一个典型的黑网特工是一个能力很强的冒险家，没有任何顾忌。一些真塔林人有带翅膀的蛇伙伴，它们在飞行时将信息写在卷轴上，使特工们能够保持彼此的联系。",
	"Although the Zhentarim as a whole oppose the cult's plans, not everyone in the Black Network shares that view. A number of Zhentarim agents believe that the cult's victory is inevitable, and that by standing against the cult, the Zhentarim risk losing everything. If events are going too smoothly for the heroes, you can introduce a few rogue Black Network agents to throw a wrench into the characters' plans at the worst possible moment.": "虽然根塔林作为一个整体反对邪教的计划，但在黑色网络中并不是每个人都赞同这种观点。一些Zhentarim特工认为，邪教的胜利是不可避免的，如果站在邪教的对立面，Zhentarim有可能失去一切。如果事件对英雄们来说太顺利了，你可以引入几个流氓黑网特工，在最糟糕的时刻给人物的计划带来麻烦。",

She disapproves of taking any wyrmspeakers alive, though, fearing the power of such dangerous figures and questioning the chance of success for attempts to turn or interrogate them.

	"The Black Network remains uncommitted until the final council when pledges are made. If the party has earned the Zhentarim's respect, they provide their services at only a nominal cost.

Brave and heroic feats that individual leaders might approve of could be frowned on by a faction as a whole if those deeds don't line up with the faction's agenda.": "大多数派系都向水底城议会派遣了一个代表团，由几个重要人物和他们的助手组成。一般来说，只有每个代表团的领导人会出席冒险家们参加的议会会议。然而，无论个别代表对人物的事迹有何反应，他们也会听从不出席议会会议的同僚的话。如果个别领导人可能赞同的勇敢和英雄事迹不符合派别的议程，那么整个派别就会对这些事迹不屑一顾。",
	"The format of the four council meetings as described below follows the flow of the adventure as set out in the \"Campaign Overview\" section. If events unfold differently in your campaign, adjust the meetings and their events accordingly. For each council meeting, a brief justification for the different attitudes of the factions is provided. More information on the factions and their delegates is provided under \"Allies\" in the book's introduction.": "下面描述的四次理事会会议的形式是按照 \"运动概述 \"部分所规定的冒险的流程进行的。如果在你的活动中，事件的发展情况不同，请相应地调整会议及其事件。对于每个议会会议，都提供了关于各派别不同态度的简要理由。关于各派别及其代表的更多信息，见本书介绍中的 \"盟友 \"部分。",
	"Each session of the council discusses the setup for chapters meant to be played as a result of that session, and the follow-up for previous chapters whose outcome is resolved in that session. In all cases, see those specific chapters for full details.": "理事会的每届会议都讨论了作为该届会议结果的各章节的设置，以及在该届会议上解决了结果的以前各章节的后续工作。在所有情况下，请参阅这些具体章节以了解全部细节。",
	"Two preliminary events help to set up the first session of the council: news of the assassination of Arthagast Ulbrinter, one of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep, and the sounding of the {@i Draakhorn}.": "两个初步的事件有助于建立议会的第一次会议：水底城假面领主之一阿尔萨加斯特-乌尔布林特被暗杀的消息，以及{@i Draakhorn}的声音。",
	"Though the leadership of the Cult of the Dragon could not have realized it, one of the key events in the fight to thwart {@creature Severin|RoT}'s plans was the cult's assassination of Arthagast Ulbrinter, a Masked Lord of Waterdeep and husband of Remi Haventree of the Harpers. News of Arthagast's recent murder has spread across the Sword Coast, and has galvanized opposition to the cult in Waterdeep.": "虽然神龙教的领导层不可能意识到这一点，但在挫败{@creature Severin|RoT}计划的斗争中，关键事件之一是该教派暗杀了沃特德普的假面领主、哈珀斯人雷米-哈文特里的丈夫阿萨加斯特-乌尔布林特。Arthagast最近被谋杀的消息已经传遍了整个剑海岸，并激发了水底世界对邪教的反对。",
	"In her grief, Remi Haventree has sworn to destroy the cult and the threat it presents to the Sword Coast. She has been instrumental in bringing the factions together for this Council of Waterdeep, setting up the potential for alliances that the adventurers must now complete.": "悲痛之余，雷米-哈文特里发誓要摧毁这个邪教，以及它对剑海岸的威胁。她在召集各派别参加这次水底议会中发挥了重要作用，为冒险家们现在必须完成的联盟设定了可能性。",
	"Shortly after the crash or capture of Skyreach Castle, operatives of the Cult of the Dragon sounded the {@item Draakhorn|RoT} at the distant Well of Dragons. An ancient magic relic, the {@item Draakhorn|RoT} is being used by the cult to summon chromatic dragons to their dark cause.": "在Skyreach城堡坠毁或被占领后不久，龙之教的成员在遥远的龙之井发出了（%0%）的声音。作为一个古老的魔法遗物，（1%）正被邪教用来召唤色龙，以实现他们的黑暗事业。",
	"As the characters are arriving in Waterdeep, read or paraphrase the following.": "当人物到达沃特迪普时，阅读或转述以下内容。",
	"A sudden shift in the wind brings with it a strange sense of unease. The feeling is akin to the drop in air pressure before the approach of a deadly storm, or faint tremors felt from a landslide or earthquake far away. You're not the only ones who have noticed. The city around you goes unnaturally quiet suddenly. No dogs bark, no birds squawk. Even the street vendors have gone silent.": "风的突然转变带来了一种奇怪的不安感。这种感觉类似于致命风暴来临前的气压下降，或者远处山体滑坡或地震带来的微弱震荡。你们不是唯一注意到的人。你周围的城市突然变得不自然的安静。没有狗叫，没有鸟叫。甚至连街上的小贩也变得沉默了。",
	"The silence lasts only a moment before the normal sounds of Waterdeep return to mask the unexplained sensation. If the characters get to a quiet place, they notice the disturbance again, like a rumbling almost too faint to hear. As well, subtle changes in the behavior of animals can be noted. Dogs are nervous and on edge, horses are skittish, cats are more feral than usual, and rats gather in large, bold packs. Sensitive NPCs are also affected, becoming nervous, fearful, and impatient.": "寂静只持续了一会儿，然后水底世界的正常声音又回来了，掩盖了这种无法解释的感觉。如果人物到了一个安静的地方，他们又会注意到这种干扰，就像隆隆声一样，几乎微弱得听不到。同样，也可以注意到动物行为的微妙变化。狗很紧张，马很胆小，猫比平时更野性，老鼠则聚集成大群。敏感的NPC也会受到影响，变得紧张、恐惧和急躁。",
	"During the first session of the council (or earlier if the characters make efforts to investigate the strange phenomenon), the adventurers are approached by Dala Silmerhelve—a Waterdhavian noble. Read or paraphrase the following when the characters speak to Dala.": "在议会的第一次会议上（如果人物努力调查这个奇怪的现象，则更早），冒险家们被达拉-西尔梅赫夫（Dala Silmerhelve）找去了，他是一个沃特达威的贵族。当人物与达拉交谈时，请阅读或转述以下内容。",
	"\"The disturbance that's been sensed across the Sword Coast is the {@item Draakhorn|RoT}—an ancient device whose sounding alerts dragons across Faerûn that great events are unfolding. It's impossible to say what the sounding means, but the dragons hear it clearly and will eventually answer its call. \"": "\"整个剑海岸所感应到的干扰是{@item Draakhorn|RoT}--一个古老的装置，它的声音提醒整个法鲁恩的龙，伟大的事件正在展开。不可能说这声音意味着什么，但龙能清楚地听到它，并且最终会响应它的召唤。\"",
	"Lady Silmerhelve learned this from her family's secret benefactor, an ancient bronze dragon named Nymmurh. She knows a little more about the {@item Draakhorn|RoT}, but she waits to reveal it until she attends the first council meeting. She flatly refuses to tell anyone the source of her knowledge if asked. This makes Ulder Ravengard, King Conneerad, and Ontharr Frume suspicious, but others take the secrecy in stride. If Lady Silmerhelve is treated poorly, It might affect how Nymmurh interacts with the characters in {@adventure Chapter 14.|RoT|5}\"": "西尔梅赫夫夫人是从她家族的秘密恩人那里得知的，那是一条名叫尼姆赫的古老青铜龙。她还知道一点关于{@item Draakhorn|RoT}的事情，但她等到参加第一次议会会议时才透露。如果被问及，她断然拒绝告诉任何人她的知识来源。这让乌尔德-拉文加德（Ulder Ravengard）、康奈拉德国王（King Conneerad）和昂赛尔-弗鲁姆（Ontharr Frume）起了疑心，但其他人对这种保密态度也很坦然。如果Silmerhelve女士受到恶劣的对待，可能会影响Nymmurh与{@adventure Chapter 14.|RoT|5}中人物的互动。\"",
	"Having accepted the invitation to the council meeting, the adventurers are received at the Lords' Palace. Make the introduction to the City of Splendors and the Lords' Palace as detailed or as simple as fits your campaign style.": "在接受了议会会议的邀请后，冒险家们在领主府受到了接待。根据你的活动风格，对辉煌之城和领主府的介绍可以很详细，也可以很简单。",
	"Once inside the Lords' Palace, the party is escorted to the secret council chambers by Leosin Erlanthar. The outer galleries are packed with nobles engaged in heated debate, and the guards are wearing livery from city-states across the North.": "进入领主府后，一行人在利奥辛-埃兰萨的陪同下前往秘密议事厅。外面的长廊挤满了正在进行激烈辩论的贵族，卫兵们穿着来自北方各城邦的制服。",
	"Although Erlanthar is not invited to the council discussions, Remallia Haventree has informed him of the agenda and the reason the party has been summoned. He advises the characters that though the factions are all nominally committed to stopping the Cult of the Dragon, none of the delegates have made substantive pledges yet.": "虽然埃尔兰萨没有被邀请参加议会的讨论，但雷玛利亚-哈文特里（Remallia Haventree）已经告诉了他议程和聚会被召集的原因。他告诉这些人物，虽然各派别在名义上都致力于阻止神龙教，但还没有一个代表做出实质性的承诺。",
	"Too much mistrust still burdens the factions, and not enough is known about the situation. Erlanthar thinks the leaders need someone to show them the right path—heroes who will lead the forces of the Sword Coast with certainty into the coming darkness. He believes that the adventurers have a chance to be those heroes. However, he explains that each faction will weigh every word the characters say and scrutinize every one of their decisions. What pleases one group might anger another, and it will be incredibly difficult to make all parties happy.": "太多的不信任仍然困扰着各派别，而且对局势的了解也不够多。埃兰萨认为领袖们需要有人为他们指明正确的道路--那些能够带领剑海岸的军队确定地进入即将到来的黑暗的英雄。他认为冒险者们有机会成为这些英雄。然而，他解释说，每个派别都会权衡人物所说的每一句话，仔细检查他们的每一个决定。让一个团体高兴的事可能会激怒另一个团体，要让各方都满意是非常困难的。",
	"Once introductions are made, Dagult Neverember summarizes the situation if the adventurers did not play through {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}. This includes the plan to summon {@creature Tiamat|RoT}, increased dragon raids led by the cult, the treasure collection system, the crash or capture of Skyreach Castle, and the importance of the wyrmspeakers and dragon masks to the cult.": "介绍完毕后，如果冒险者没有玩过{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}，达古特-纽伦堡就总结一下情况。这包括召唤（%1%）的计划，由邪教领导的龙族突袭的增加，宝藏收集系统，天际城堡的崩溃或被占领，以及巫术师和龙面具对邪教的重要性。",
	"If the party played through the previous adventure, Dagult explains that the council has heard reports from Ontharr, Leosin, and other witnesses, but that the delegates wish to hear from the heroes at the center of recent events. (At this point, use Neverember to also fill in any information the characters did not gather during {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen} that you deem important.)": "如果队伍经历了之前的冒险，达古特解释说议会已经听取了昂赛尔、利奥辛和其他证人的报告，但代表们希望听取处于最近事件中心的英雄们的意见。(在这一点上，请用 \"永生 \"来填补人物在{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}期间没有收集到的任何你认为重要的信息）。",
	"Most of the factions recognize that Skyreach Castle needed to be stopped, and they are happy if the castle was crashed. However, some members of the Lords' Alliance think it unconscionable that such a resource would be destroyed, intentionally or otherwise. These dissidents believe it would have been better for the characters to have waited for reinforcements, then attacked to secure the castle (regardless of how unrealistic that plan might have been).": "大多数派别都认识到，天际城堡需要被阻止，如果城堡被撞毁，他们也很高兴。然而，领主联盟的一些成员认为，不管是有意还是无意，这样的资源被摧毁是不合情理的。这些持不同意见的人认为，角色们最好先等待援军，然后再进攻以确保城堡的安全（不管这个计划可能有多么不现实）。",
	"The fate of the dragon hatchery divides opinion as well. Most delegates respect a decision to destroy the hatchery, accepting that having fewer dragons to deal with later on is an advantage. However, the Harpers would have preferred the eggs to be kept for ransoming back to their parents, potentially keeping those dragons from cooperating with the cult. Dagult would have sold the valuable eggs to \"responsible buyers,\" then used that gold to hire more mercenaries. The Emerald Enclave is firmly against any dragon eggs being destroyed, believing that the chromatic dragons are a part of the natural order and that killing their young upsets the balance of that order. Taern Hornblade and Lady Laeral Silverhand think there might have been a way to leverage the eggs as ransom, but both recognize that they would have been dangerous to hold onto—and even more dangerous to return.": "龙的孵化场的命运也存在意见分歧。大多数代表尊重摧毁孵化场的决定，认为以后少一些龙来处理是一个好处。然而，哈珀斯人更倾向于保留这些龙蛋，以便将其赎回给它们的父母，这可能会使这些龙不与邪教合作。达古特会把这些有价值的蛋卖给 \"负责任的买家\"，然后用这些黄金来雇佣更多的雇佣兵。翡翠飞地坚决反对销毁任何龙蛋，认为色龙是自然秩序的一部分，杀死它们的幼龙会破坏这种秩序的平衡。Taern Hornblade和Lady Laeral Silverhand认为可能有办法利用这些龙蛋作为赎金，但他们都认识到，持有这些龙蛋会很危险，而归还龙蛋则更危险。",
	"When the discussion around the events from {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen} is concluded, the council moves on to current matters. It's obvious to all that the adventurers have taken a firm hand in addressing this crisis, and that they have proven their worth. The council deputizes the characters with emergency investigative powers and a writ demonstrating such. This grants the characters access to resources and sites they deem necessary for their investigation, but carries with it the burden of oversight from the council. If the adventurers misbehave or abuse their powers, their actions will be reviewed and the writ will be revoked.": "当围绕{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}事件的讨论结束后，议会转而讨论当前的事务。很明显，冒险家们在处理这场危机时采取了坚定的态度，他们已经证明了自己的价值。议会授予这些人物紧急调查的权力和证明这种权力的文件。这使他们有机会进入他们认为必要的资源和地点进行调查，但同时也承担了理事会的监督责任。如果冒险者行为不端或滥用他们的权力，他们的行为将被审查，令状将被撤销。",
	"Once the characters have been vested with their powers, the first stages of the adventure await.": "一旦人物被赋予了他们的力量，冒险的第一阶段就会到来。",
	"One of Remallia Haventree's first acts in her fight against the Cult of the Dragon was to encourage the Harpers to focus all their resources on the cult's activities and its most powerful members. Those efforts have been successful, and Leosin Erlanthar reports to the adventurers of the movements of {@creature Varram|RoT}, the cult's White Wyrmspeaker. This leads to \"{@adventure Varram the White|RoT|3|Varram the White},\" Part of \"{@adventure Chapters 11 and 12: Death to the Wyrmspeakers|RoT|3}\".": "雷玛利亚-哈文特里（Remallia Haventree）在与巨龙教的斗争中的第一个行动就是鼓励哈珀人将所有的资源集中在该教派的活动和其最强大的成员身上。这些努力是成功的，Leosin Erlanthar向冒险者们报告了该邪教的白巫师（%0%）的动向。这导致了\"{@adventure Varram the White|RoT|3|Varram the White}\"，\"{@adventure Chapters 11 and 12: Death to the Wyrmspeakers|RoT|3} \"的一部分。",
	"The sounding of the {@item Draakhorn|RoT} weighs heavily on all the leaders of the Sword Coast. Seeking more information on the horn and its whereabouts leads the party on an expedition to the frozen North, and {@adventure chapter 10|RoT|2}.": "{@item Draakhorn|RoT}的响声让剑海岸的所有领导人感到沉重。为了寻求更多关于号角和它的下落的信息，党员们开始了对冰冷的北方的远征，并且（%%1%）。",
	"At the Second Council of Waterdeep, the adventurers see two new faces. Lord Neverember has been replaced as Open Lord of Waterdeep by Lady Laeral Silverhand, who now sits at the head of the council table. Dagult sits to her right, alongside a human female introduced as Elia (see below).": "在水底世界的第二次会议上，冒险者们看到了两张新面孔。永恒之神（Lord Neverember）已经被银手女士（Lady Laeral Silverhand）取代，成为水底世界的公开领主，她现在坐在议会桌的首位。达古特坐在她的右边，旁边还有一个被介绍为伊利亚的人类女性（见下文）。",
	"The delegates discuss the raids in their various domains after receiving the characters' report, providing flavor for the ongoing activities of the cult and giving a clear impression that the situation is escalating.": "代表们在收到人物的报告后讨论了他们各个领域的突击行动，为邪教正在进行的活动提供了味道，并给人以局势正在升级的清晰印象。",
	"In response to the fate of Wyrmspeaker {@creature Varram|RoT}, the Harpers and Taern are upset if the dwarf was slain without being interrogated, and Connerad is upset that {@creature Varram|RoT} was not captured and made an example of in a court of dwarven law. Though most are pleased with capturing {@creature Varram|RoT}, the Emerald Enclave is nonplussed, believing that capturing him only complicates matters. {@creature Varram|RoT} has already demonstrated a willingness to corrupt the natural order, making a trial excessive—and potentially opening the door to a rescue attempt.": "对于Wyrmspeaker{@creature Varram|RoT}的命运，哈珀斯和塔恩对这个矮人没有被审问就被杀死感到不满，而康纳德对{@creature Varram|RoT}没有被抓到并在矮人法庭上被当做例子感到不满。虽然大多数人对抓捕{@creature Varram|RoT}感到高兴，但翡翠飞地却不以为然，认为抓捕他只会让事情变得复杂。{@creature Varram|RoT}已经表现出了腐蚀自然秩序的意愿，使审判变得过分，并有可能为救援行动打开大门。",
	"The Arcane Brotherhood are powerful allies, and all are pleased if the party wins their allegiance—with the exception of the Order of the Gauntlet. Ontharr Frume knows that the Arcane Brotherhood does not police its members in what kinds of knowledge they pursue, and that they tolerate many evil wizards in their company. Bringing the Arcane Brotherhood into the alliance doesn't lose Frume's respect, but neither does it earn it.": "奥术兄弟会是强大的盟友，如果党派赢得了他们的效忠，所有人都会很高兴--除了高塔骑士团之外。昂赛尔-弗鲁姆知道，奥术兄弟会并不监管其成员追求什么样的知识，而且他们容忍许多邪恶的巫师与他们为伍。将奥术兄弟会带入联盟并不会失去弗鲁姆的尊重，但也不会赢得他的尊重。",
	"Delaan Winterhound of the Emerald Enclave is involved with investigations into recent dragon attacks in the Misty Forest. King Melandrach waves away Delaan's concerns, saying that dragon attacks in the area have stopped since his elves increased their patrols and fortified their positions. Discovering the truth will lead the adventurers to \"{@area Neronvain,|12d|x}\" part of \"{@adventure Chapters 11 and 12:Death to the Wyrmspeakers.|RoT|3}\"": "翡翠飞地的德拉安-温特猎犬参与了对迷雾森林最近发生的龙类攻击的调查。梅兰德斯国王对德拉恩的担忧置之不理，说自从他的精灵们加强巡逻和加固阵地后，该地区的龙攻击就停止了。发现真相后，冒险家们将前往\"{@area Neronvain,|12d|x} \"的一部分\"{@adventure Chapters 11 and 12:Death to the Wyrmspeakers.|RoT|3}\"",
	"During the council, the adventurers are introduced to the silver dragon Otaaryliakkarnos, in her human guise as Elia. She bears an invitation from the metallic dragons to a council of their own, and the council delegates ask the adventurers to attend. This leads into {@adventure chapter 14|RoT|5}.": "在议会期间，冒险家们被介绍给银龙奥塔里亚克卡诺斯，她的人类身份是埃利亚。她带着金属龙的邀请函参加他们自己的议会，议会代表要求冒险者们参加。这导致了{@adventure chapter 14|RoT|5}。",
	"The third council features another new face—the tiefling Rian Nightshade, introduced as a special adviser to Lord Neverember. Characters who pay attention notice that some at the meeting—including Sir Isteval, Ontharr Frume, and Ambassador Brawnanvil—are doing their best to ignore the secret Zhentarim delegate, who makes no statements unless addressed by the party.": "第三次会议的主角是另一张新面孔--铁皮人里安-夜影，他被介绍为纽伦堡爵士的特别顾问。有心人注意到，会议上的一些人--包括伊斯特瓦尔爵士、昂萨-弗鲁姆和布劳南维尔大使--都在尽力忽视那个秘密的赞塔林代表，除非有当事人发言，否则他是不会发言的。",
	"News that the dragon attacks in the elven forest have ended is gratefully received by all on the council. However, King Melandrach responds with cold fury to news of his son {@creature Neronvain|RoT}'s betrayal. He remains hesitant to put elves in the front lines of combat, but no longer acts as a roadblock to negotiations. His pragmatism means that he no longer has any qualms against the adventurers' securing the allegiance of Red Wizards, giants, or even devils in the fight against the Cult of the Dragon—as long as such allies are conveniently arrayed in front of his elves in battle.": "精灵森林中的龙族攻击已经结束的消息被议会中的所有人欣然接受。然而，梅兰德斯国王对他儿子{@creature Neronvain|RoT}背叛的消息做出了冷酷的反应。他仍然对把精灵放在战斗前线犹豫不决，但不再充当谈判的路障。他的实用主义意味着他不再对冒险者在对抗龙之教的斗争中获得红袍巫师、巨人甚至魔鬼的效忠有任何顾虑，只要这些盟友在战斗中能方便地排列在他的精灵面前。",
	"All the delegates are impressed if the party has gained the support of the metallic dragons, even if their own faction was asked to make concessions. The good dragons are wise and just creatures, and their acceptance of the party greatly boosts the adventurers' standing in everyone's eyes.": "如果党获得了金属龙的支持，即使他们自己的派别被要求做出让步，所有代表都会留下深刻印象。好的龙是明智而公正的生物，他们对党的接受大大提升了冒险者在大家眼中的地位。",
	"King Melandrach is furious if the characters agreed to an apology for the {@i Dracorage mythal}. He makes the apology because honor demands it, but he resents the party for forcing his hand. Connerad Brawnanvil is similarly unhappy if a concession was made in response to the ancient dragonmoots of the dwarves. The traditions of the dragonmoot saved many lives in their time, and the fact that one metallic dragon was injured indicates that it was probably misbehaving. Dwarves have no patience for tolerating misbehaving dragons, no matter what their color.": "如果人物同意为（%0%）道歉，梅兰德斯国王很生气。他做出道歉是因为荣誉的要求，但他怨恨党人强迫他出手。如果针对矮人的古老龙卷风做出让步，康纳德-布劳南威尔也同样不高兴。Dragonmoot的传统在他们的时代拯救了许多人的生命，而一条金属龙受伤的事实表明，它可能是行为不端。矮人没有耐心容忍行为不端的龙，无论其颜色如何。",
	"Bartering away portions of the hoard that the cult stole is the only way some factions can make concessions. For every concession that was made for a share, circle a negative (−) icon in the following order: Dagult Neverember, Connerad, Melandrach, Lady Laeral, Ulder Ravengard, Taern Hornblade, the Harpers, Sir Isteval, and the Order of the Gauntlet. The Emerald Enclave is not affected by such concessions, since the order has not been overly affected by the dragon raids.": "用邪教偷来的囤积物的一部分进行交换，是一些派别做出让步的唯一方式。对于每一个做出让步的份额，按以下顺序圈出一个负数（-）的图标。Dagult Neverember, Connerad, Melandrach, Lady Laeral, Ulder Ravengard, Taern Hornblade, the Harpers, Sir Isteval, and the Order of the Gauntlet。翡翠飞地不受这种让步的影响，因为该骑士团没有受到龙族突袭的过度影响。",
	"As an effect of the way in which the adventurers have impressed the dragon council, it now falls to them to allocate the dragons that have pledged their service to the factions. Dragons allocated to a delegate of the Lords' Alliance are assigned to protect the capital city of the delegate's territory. A dragon assigned to the Harpers will be used for intelligence gathering. The Order of the Gauntlet sends any dragons to the city of Elturel, while the Emerald Enclave sends dragons to guard the ancient treant known as the Grandfather Tree. The party can also distribute dragons to specific regions. In such a scenario, a dragon protects a 100-mile-radius area around the point where it is assigned, stopping draconic raids in that area.": "由于冒险家们给龙会留下了深刻的印象，现在由他们来分配那些已经承诺为各派别服务的龙。分配给领主联盟代表的龙被指派保护该代表领地的首都。分配给哈珀斯的龙将被用于收集情报。高塔骑士团将任何龙派往Elturel城，而翡翠飞地则派龙守护被称为祖父树的古老树人。党派也可以将龙分配到特定区域。在这种情况下，一条龙会保护它被分配到的地点周围100英里半径的区域，阻止龙族在该区域的突袭。",
	"At the summit, information comes to the characters revealing that a senior member of the Cult of the Dragon seeks to defect from the group, and that the cultist is offering a dragon mask as part of his plea for aid. Though the offer could be a trap, the council delegates believe that the risk is worth it. The defector is holed up in a fortress known as Xonthal's Tower, recently taken over by the cult. Because a small team has a better chance to successfully infiltrate the tower than a larger force, the adventurers are asked to investigate. This leads to {@adventure chapter 15|RoT|6}.": "在峰会上，这些人物得到的信息显示，神龙教的一名高级成员试图叛离该组织，而且该邪教分子提供了一个龙的面具作为他请求援助的一部分。虽然这个提议可能是一个陷阱，但议会代表们认为这个风险是值得的。叛逃者被藏在一个被称为Xonthal's Tower的堡垒里，最近被邪教组织占领了。因为小队比大队更有机会成功潜入塔内，所以冒险家们被要求进行调查。这导致了{@adventure chapter 15|RoT|6}。",
	"The Red Wizards are integral to the cult's plans for summoning {@creature Tiamat|RoT}, but the Red Wizards allied with the Cult of the Dragon are exiles with no connection to Thay. The Thayan Red Wizards approach the Council of Waterdeep asking for an envoy to be sent to Thay, where they must convince the most reviled wizards in Faerûn to join with the forces of the Sword Coast for the common good. This paves the way for {@adventure chapter 16|RoT|7}.": "红袍巫师在邪教的召唤计划中不可或缺（%0%），但与神龙教结盟的红袍巫师是流亡者，与泰伊没有关系。泰伊的红袍巫师找到水底议会，要求派遣特使前往泰伊，他们必须说服法鲁恩最遭人唾弃的巫师，为了共同的利益与剑岸的力量联合起来。这为{@adventure chapter 16|RoT|7}铺平了道路。",
	"The fourth council is the final meeting between the faction leaders and the adventurers. Hundreds of chromatic dragons have been sighted near the Well of Dragons, and the time has come to strike. At the end of this council, the delegates make their final decisions of support for the adventurers and their cause, if they haven't done so already.": "第四次会议是各派别领导人和冒险者之间的最后一次会议。在龙之井附近发现了数百条色龙，现在是出击的时候了。在这次会议结束时，如果代表们还没有做出支持冒险者和他们的事业的最后决定，他们会做出这样的决定。",
	"At an appropriate point in the council meetings, Rian Nightshade approaches the characters and asks for a private audience. She explains her position as an emissary of the Zhentarim, and of the Zhentarim's interest in current affairs. She bemoans the dithering of the other factions, stating that the Black Network is willing to act immediately and unflinchingly—if the party can help arrange agreeable terms for the Zhentarim's support.": "在理事会会议的一个适当时刻，里安-夜影走近这些人物，要求进行私人会谈。她解释了她作为Zhentarim使者的身份，以及Zhentarim对当前事务的兴趣。她哀叹其他派别的犹豫不决，并表示黑网愿意立即毫不犹豫地采取行动--如果该党能够帮助安排赞塔林支持的合意条款。",
	"Rian points out that the Zhentarim have a keen interest in Xonthal's Tower. Ownership of the tower is under discussion by the council, but the tiefling wants to deal directly with the adventurers, who have claim to the tower by right of conquest. The Zhentarim are willing to purchase the adventurers' interest in the tower for 50,000 gold pieces, and Rian can throw in a {@item Potion of Greater Healing|| greater healing potion}, a {@item potion of frost giant strength}, and a {@item spell scroll} of {@spell earthquake} to sweeten the deal. This price could go up considerably if the party negotiates agreeable terms from the other factions for the Zhentarim's support—up to an additional 25,000 gp, at your discretion.": "里安指出，Zhentarim对Xonthal的塔有浓厚的兴趣。议会正在讨论该塔的所有权，但铁皮人想直接与冒险者打交道，因为他们有征服权，对该塔有要求。镇塔人愿意以50,000金币的价格购买冒险者在塔中的权益，而且里安可以在{@item Potion of Greater Healing|| greater healing potion}、{@item potion of frost giant strength}和{@item spell scroll}的{@spell earthquake}中加入甜头。如果党派从其他派别那里谈判出同意的条款，以获得Zhentarim的支持，这个价格可能会大幅上升--最多可额外增加25000金币，由你决定。",
	"Any alliance with the Red Wizards is a mixed blessing. More pragmatic factions and delegates—including the Harpers, King Melandrach, Dagult Neverember, and Taern Hornblade—are impressed by the diplomacy such an arrangement demonstrates, and know that regardless of the Red Wizards' character and previous plots against the Sword Coast, they are a significant asset. Sir Isteval, Ambassador Brawnanvil, and the Order of the Gauntlet object to the idea of even opening dialogue with the Red Wizards, and believe that the Thayans would agree to an alliance only if it furthered their own plots to rule the Sword Coast and all Faerûn. Lady Laeral and Ulder Ravengard both think the Red Wizards unpredictable but necessary, believing that the only important factor is how the Thayans influence the outcome of the final battle.": "任何与红袍巫师的联盟都是喜忧参半的。更加务实的派别和代表--包括哈珀人、梅兰德斯国王、达古特-纽伦堡和泰恩-霍恩布拉德--对这种安排所展现的外交手段印象深刻，并知道无论红袍巫师的性格和之前对剑海岸的阴谋如何，他们都是一笔重要的资产。Isteval爵士、Brawnanvil大使和Gauntlet骑士团反对与红袍巫师展开对话的想法，并认为只有在促进他们自己统治剑海岸和整个Faerûn的阴谋的情况下，Thayans才会同意建立联盟。拉伊尔夫人和乌尔德-拉文加德都认为红袍巫师是不可预测的，但也是必要的，他们认为唯一重要的因素是塔扬人如何影响最后的战斗结果。",
	"The outcome of the support of the metallic dragons (as allocated in the third council) is accounted for in this fourth council. Factions that did not receive draconic aid suffer terribly in the cult's raids, and some delegates resent the adventurers for withholding the service of their dragon allies. Only Isteval, Connerad, and the Harpers maintain their respect for the adventurers regardless of how the dragons were assigned. Cormyr remains largely untouched by the cult, whose operations remain focused on the Sword Coast. The Harpers have no strongholds, and so suffer less than other factions. Ambassador Brawnanvil appreciates the value of dragon guards, but his strongholds are deep underground and hard for the cult to reach—and all dwarves know how even good dragons covet dwarven gems and gold.": "金属龙支持的结果（如在第三次议会中的分配）在这第四次议会中得到了说明。没有得到龙族援助的派别在邪教的袭击中遭受了极大的伤害，一些代表对冒险者扣留龙族盟友的服务感到不满。只有伊斯特瓦尔（Isteval）、康纳德（Connerad）和哈珀斯（Harpers）对冒险者保持尊重，不管龙是如何被分配的。科米尔在很大程度上没有受到邪教的影响，他们的行动仍然集中在剑海岸。哈珀人没有据点，所以比其他派别受到的影响要小。布劳南威尔大使很欣赏龙族守卫的价值，但他的据点深入地下，邪教很难到达--所有矮人都知道即使是好龙也会觊觎矮人的宝石和黄金。",
	"Every faction will donate troops and resources to the struggle against the Cult of the Dragon. However, to win the battle requires the full, unconditional support of multiple factions.

	"Which way a faction leans is determined by the adventurers' actions and accomplishments during the adventure. Successfully completing an chapter of the adventure will usually gain support from multiple factions. However, each faction has its own priorities, and sometimes a heroic deed that pleases one faction can anger or disappoint another. In some cases, a faction might even prefer that the characters engage in antiheroic acts—by executing certain enemies rather than taking prisoners, for example. The adventurers might also be seen to be favoring certain factions, if metallic dragon allies are sent to defend the interests and settlements of one faction over another.": "一个派别倾向于哪个方向是由冒险者在冒险过程中的行动和成就决定的。成功完成冒险的某一章节通常会获得多个派系的支持。然而，每个派别都有自己的优先权，有时一个英雄的行为如果让一个派别高兴，就会让另一个派别感到愤怒或失望。在某些情况下，一个派别甚至可能希望人物从事反英雄的行为--例如，处决某些敌人而不是俘虏。如果金属龙的盟友被派去捍卫一个派别的利益和定居点，而不是另一个派别，那么冒险者也可能被视为偏袒某些派别。",

Gigantic icebergs wander listlessly through this glasslike sea, or are sent smashing and grinding against each other by bitterly cold winds, the sea spray transformed into fantastic frozen shapes around them. Only creatures adapted to severe cold can survive such frigid extremes, but many beasts—and even people—make their homes in the Sea of Moving Ice. One such creature is the white dragon Arauthator, known as \"Old White Death\" by those he stalks and terrorizes. In this section of the adventure, the heroes' battle against the cult leads them to one of Arauthator's iceberg lairs.": "在遥远的北方，在世界之脊之外，甚至在冰风谷之上，是移动的冰海。巨大的冰山无精打采地在这片玻璃般的海洋中游荡，或者被严寒的风吹得粉碎，相互摩擦，海浪在它们周围变成了奇妙的冰冻形状。只有适应严寒的生物才能在如此寒冷的极端环境中生存，但许多野兽，甚至人类都在移动的冰海中安家。白龙Arauthator就是这样一种生物，他被那些被他跟踪和恐吓的人称为 \"老白死\"。在冒险的这一部分中，英雄们与邪教的战斗将他们带到了阿劳特的一个冰山巢穴中。",

More than a century ago, during one of the cyclical periods of draconic violence known as the Rage of Dragons, Arauthator joined with a dozen other dragons in attacking the Hosttower of the Arcane in Luskan. Their assault toppled the west arm of the tower, and Arauthator was seen scooping up numerous items of great magical importance and power, including at least three tomes of rare spells. The possibility of recovering those books is part of what drew {@creature Maccath the Crimson|RoT} to the Sea of Moving Ice.": "除了他的体型、狡猾和凶猛之外，Arauthator还拥有法术能力，这使他成为一个特别危险的敌人。一个多世纪以前，在被称为 \"龙之怒 \"的龙族暴力周期中，Arauthator与其他十几条龙一起袭击了卢斯坎的奥术主机塔。他们的攻击推翻了塔的西臂，人们看到Arauthator捡起了许多具有巨大魔法重要性和力量的物品，包括至少三本稀有的法术书。恢复这些书籍的可能性是吸引{@creature Maccath the Crimson|RoT}来到移动冰海的部分原因。",

At one time, Arveiaturace served a wizard named Meltharond, whose corpse remains strapped to a saddle on the dragon's back. She has never accepted his death, and still speaks to him as if he were alive.

If the characters and crew don't intend to haul {@i Frostskimmr} onto an ice floe for the night, one of the scrags swims beneath the ship and wrenches a plank loose, causing a serious leak that requires the ship to be pulled onto the ice for repairs.": "这个事件只在晚上发生，而且只在冰上发生。当{@i Frostskimmr}坐在浮冰上等待天亮时，三个被称为{@creature Scrag|TftYP|scrags}的水生巨魔（游泳速度30英尺，可以在水下呼吸）攻击了船只。如果角色和船员不打算把{@i Frostskimmr}拖到浮冰上过夜，其中一个水怪就会游到船下，把一块木板拧松，造成严重的泄漏，需要把船拉到冰上修理。",
	"This event can occur only by day. A hunting party from Oyaviggaton (12 {@creature Tribal Warrior|| tribal warriors}) is spotted pursuing seals on an ice floe, whether {@i Frostskimmr} is on the water or on an adjacent ice floe. The hunters are surly and uncommunicative if approached, knowing that they must return to the iceberg before nightfall or their kin will be punished. Captain Lerustah is puzzled by their behavior, knowing that the Ice Hunter people are shy but never hostile. The hunters quickly paddle their khyeks away to the northeast. If the characters follow the hunters or use that bearing for the next stage of their journey, they gain a +1 bonus to their next daytime event roll.": "此事件只能在白天发生。来自奥亚维加顿（12（%0%））的狩猎队被发现在浮冰上追捕海豹，无论（%1%）是在水上还是在相邻的浮冰上。如果有人接近，猎人们会很生气，不善言辞，因为他们知道必须在天黑前返回冰山，否则他们的亲属会受到惩罚。勒鲁斯塔船长对他们的行为感到疑惑，他知道猎冰人很害羞，但从来没有敌意。猎人们很快就划着船向东北方向走去。如果人物跟随猎人，或在下一阶段的旅程中使用该方位，他们的下一次日间活动卷轴将获得+1奖励。",
	"This event occurs only during the day. A group of fishers from Oyaviggaton (12 {@creature Tribal Warrior||tribal warriors}) are spotted in their characteristic boats, whether {@i Frostskimmr} is in the water or on a nearby ice floe. They are unfriendly and uncommunicative if approached, paddling away to the northeast as soon as they are able. If the characters follow the hunters or use that bearing for the next stage of their journey, they gain a +1 bonus to their next daytime event roll.": "这一事件只发生在白天。一群来自奥亚维加顿的渔民（12人（%0%））被发现在他们特有的船上，无论（%1%）是在水中还是在附近的浮冰上。如果接近他们，他们是不友好的，也不善于沟通，一有机会就会向东北方向划去。如果人物跟随猎人或使用该方位进行下一阶段的旅行，他们的下一个白天事件卷获得+1奖励。",
	"This event can occur by day or night. There's no mistaking the silhouette of this massive iceberg as matching the description given by {@creature Maccath the Crimson|RoT}. With a flattened expanse at one end rising to jagged peaks at the other, the characters' objective is at hand.": "这一事件可以在白天或晚上发生。这座巨大的冰山的轮廓与{@creature Maccath the Crimson|RoT}给出的描述一致，不会有错。一端是平坦的大山，另一端是参差不齐的山峰，人物的目标就在眼前。",
	"Arauthator's iceberg lair rises from the sea to form a floating island. The portion of the berg above the water appears roughly triangular, with rounded corners. The plateau portion of the iceberg rises more than a hundred feet above the water, and the jagged ice peaks add another two hundred feet above that.": "Arauthator的冰山巢穴从海中升起，形成一个浮动的岛屿。冰山高出水面的部分看起来大致呈三角形，有圆角。冰山的高原部分高出水面一百多英尺，参差不齐的冰峰在此之上又增加了两百英尺。",
	"The Ice Hunter village is a collection of snow shelters and tents sitting at the center of the island. The village can't be seen from the sea because of the berg's height, but a large shelf of ice where the Ice Hunters beach their boats is clearly visible from the water. Approximately 60 feet across, the shelf rises a few feet above sea level and is littered with enormous, cracked bones—including ribs that arch taller than a human.": "猎冰者村是一个由雪棚和帐篷组成的集合体，坐落在岛屿的中心。由于冰山的高度，从海上看不到村子，但从水面上可以清楚地看到猎冰人停泊船只的一个大冰架。冰架大约有60英尺宽，高出海平面几英尺，到处都是巨大的、破裂的骨头--包括比人还高的肋骨。",
	"A character proficient in {@skill Nature} recognizes that the bones are mostly from whales and huge seals (or Captain Lerustah can supply that information). Any character who spends a few minutes examining the bones discovers tooth marks with a monstrous bite radius—evidence that a gigantic predator (Arauthator) ate at least some of these creatures. Examining the bones reveals smaller human bones in the pile as well, all of which show the same bite marks.": "一个精通{@skill Nature}的人物认识到，这些骨头主要来自鲸鱼和巨大的海豹（或者Lerustah船长可以提供这些信息）。任何花几分钟检查这些骨头的人物都会发现具有巨大咬合半径的牙印--这证明一个巨大的食肉动物（Arauthator）至少吃了这些生物中的一部分。检查这些骨头时发现，在这堆骨头中还有一些较小的人骨，它们都有同样的咬痕。",
	"An ice chasm splits the cliff face above the ice shelf, rising to the top of the plateau. The chasm is 20 feet wide near the bottom but narrows to 5 feet wide at the top. Steps are cut into the ice, making for an easy climb to the top of the plateau.": "一条冰鸿沟劈开了冰架上方的悬崖面，上升到高原的顶部。鸿沟在底部有20英尺宽，但在顶部缩小到5英尺宽。冰面上开有台阶，可以很容易地爬到高原的顶部。",
	"Captain Lerustah would like to keep his crew members aboard {@i Frostskimmr} rather than marching them up to the plateau. He's not at all comfortable with the idea of leaving his ship without the strongest possible complement of guards. If the characters are unable to communicate with the Ice Hunters (who speak only their own language, Uluik), one of the crew members speaks enough Uluik to get by. The translator will accompany the characters onto the iceberg if he's paid a bonus of at least 50 gp, but he returns to the ship as soon as the characters descend into the ice caves.": "Lerustah船长想把他的船员留在船上（%0%），而不是把他们赶到高原上。他对在没有最强大的警卫的情况下离开他的船的想法一点也不舒服。如果角色无法与猎冰人（他们只说自己的语言，Uluik）沟通，其中一名船员会说足够的Uluik语。如果翻译得到至少50金币的奖励，他就会陪同人物进入冰山，但当人物进入冰洞后，他就会返回船上。",
	"The top of Oyaviggaton is a plateau, but it's not level. The ground is uneven, fractured by narrow ice chasms and divided by rills, snowdrifts, and ice ridges taller than a human, sculpted by sea spray and wind. The ridges block the view of the village until characters are 200 feet from the nearest shelter.": "奥亚维加顿的顶部是一个高原，但它并不平整。地面凹凸不平，被狭窄的冰裂缝分割，被山丘、雪堆和比人还高的冰脊分割，被海浪和风雕琢而成。这些冰脊挡住了村庄的视线，直到人物离最近的避难所有200英尺。",
	"The first sight that greets the adventurers when they emerge onto the plateau is a row of ten corpses frozen into a wall of ice: three Luskar warriors, a dwarf, and six Ice Hunters. The bodies have been preserved in the ice, making it impossible to tell how long they've been here. The southerners and the dwarf were some of {@creature Maccath the Crimson|RoT}'s companions, killed by Arauthator. The Ice Hunters used the bodies to put up this grisly warning, in the hope that other intruders might fear the same fate and turn back. The dead Ice Hunters tried to flee from the iceberg but were hunted and killed by Arauthator, who forced their kin to add them to the horrid display.": "当冒险者出现在高原上时，迎接他们的第一个景象是一排被冻成冰墙的十具尸体：三个卢斯卡战士、一个矮人和六个猎冰者。这些尸体被保存在冰中，无法判断他们在这里呆了多久。南方人和矮人是(%%)的一些同伴，被阿劳特杀死。猎冰者们用这些尸体发出了这个可怕的警告，希望其他入侵者会害怕同样的命运而回头。死去的猎冰人试图逃离冰山，但被阿劳特追杀，阿劳特强迫他们的亲属将他们加入到这个可怕的展览中。",
	"The village sits in a sheltered spot near the center of the iceberg. When the wind blows—which is most of the time—snow whips off the surrounding drifts and surrounds the settlement in a swirling shroud of white.": "这个村子坐落在靠近冰山中心的一个避风点。当风吹来时--大部分时间都是如此--雪从周围的漂流物上拂过，将定居点包围在一片白色的漩涡中。",
	"Twenty structures make up the village, divided between snow-block shelters similar to igloos and double-walled yurts made from sealskin stretched over whalebone frames. Sixteen of these structures are small, one-room family dwellings. One ice-block shelter is a storeroom used for gear owned in common by the tribesfolk, including fishing nets and heavy ropes used for whaling. One yurt near the center of the village is slightly larger than the others, and is home to the Ice Hunter chieftain, Barking Seal. A yurt standing apart from the rest of the shelters is home to the shaman Bonecarver, as indicated by the many animal totems and whalebone carvings around the hut. The shaman's hut features a lesser-used entrance to the ice caves.": "该村有20座建筑，分为类似于冰屋的雪块棚和用海豹皮延伸到鲸骨框架上的双壁蒙古包。这些建筑中有16个是小型的、单间的家庭住宅。有一个冰块住所是一个储藏室，用来存放部落居民共同拥有的装备，包括捕鲸用的渔网和沉重的绳索。靠近村子中心的一个蒙古包比其他的稍大一些，是猎冰人首领巴金海豹的家。一个与其他住所分开的蒙古包是萨满Bonecarver的家，从小屋周围的许多动物图腾和鲸骨雕刻就可以看出。萨满的小屋有一个较少使用的冰洞入口。",
	"The largest structure in the village is the meeting hall, heavily decorated with whalebone and the skulls of fish and mammals. Consisting of one large room, the hall has a wooden floor made of planks salvaged from ships caught and crushed in the Sea of Moving Ice. Beneath the planks in a back corner is an entrance to the ice caves under the village, which lead to Arauthator's grotto. A long coil of rope hangs on the wall near that corner, and a large iron pulley has been left suspended from a beam above the hole.": "村里最大的建筑是会议厅，用鲸骨以及鱼和哺乳动物的头骨进行了大量的装饰。大厅由一个大房间组成，其木质地板是由在移动的冰海中被捕获和压碎的船只打捞上来的木板制成。在木板下面的一个角落里，有一个通往村子下面的冰洞的入口，它通向阿劳特的石窟。在那个角落附近的墙上挂着一卷长长的绳子，一个大铁滑轮被悬挂在洞口上方的横梁上。",
	"No columns of smoke rise above the village to give away its location, since the Sea of Moving Ice features no wood or peat to burn. The only artificial heat comes from lamps and tiny stoves burning whale oil. The villagers live on fish, whale meat, and seal meat, eaten raw or dried on racks scattered around the village. With a successful DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Survival}) check, a character examining the racks realizes that the village must produce far more food than the number of villagers alone would require.": "由于移动的冰海没有木材或泥炭可供燃烧，所以村子上空没有烟柱，也不会泄露它的位置。唯一的人工热量来自于灯和燃烧鲸油的小炉子。村民们以鱼、鲸鱼肉和海豹肉为生，生吃或晒在散落在村庄周围的架子上。在成功通过DC10智力（（%0%））检查的情况下，检查架子的人物意识到，村子里生产的食物必须远远超过村民人数的需求。",
	"If the characters approach by the obvious path up the chasm from the ice ledge, they are noticed by the village's 12 sled dogs (treat as {@creature Wolf||wolves}). As soon as the dogs begin barking and growling, the whole village turns out armed and alert—25 {@creature Tribal Warrior||tribal warriors} (males and females; including the chieftain, Barking Seal), 30 {@creature Commoner||commoners}, 1 {@creature druid} (Bonecarver, tribal shaman, female), and 1 {@creature gladiator} (Orcaheart, village champion, male).": "如果角色从冰架上的明显路径接近鸿沟，他们会被村里的12只雪橇犬注意到（视为（%0%））。当狗开始吠叫和咆哮时，整个村子就会出现武装和警戒--25个（1%）（男性和女性；包括首领Barking Seal）、30个（2%）、1个（3%）（Bonecarver，部落萨满，女性）和1个（4%）（Orcaheart，村庄冠军，男性）。",
	"The chieftain and shaman do all the talking for the villagers, who speak only their own language, Uluik. The chieftain also knows a little of a rough Illuskan dialect. The Ice Hunters have two main interests: finding out why strangers have come to Oyaviggaton, and getting them to leave. They lie freely and well, telling tales of sea monsters and ravaging scrags in the area. If the characters ask about Arauthator or other dragons, the shaman claims a dragon known as Old White Death was killed a year ago by frost giants. She describes the heap of whale and seal bones on the waterside ice shelf as all that's left of the monster. Otherwise, the bones are described as evidence of monstrous predators in the area.": "酋长和萨满为村民们做所有的谈话，他们只说自己的语言--乌卢克语。酋长还懂一点粗略的伊鲁斯坎方言。猎冰人有两个主要兴趣：找出陌生人来到奥亚维格顿的原因，并让他们离开。他们自由自在地撒谎，讲述海怪和蹂躏该地区的擦伤的故事。如果角色们问起Arauthator或其他龙，萨满声称一条被称为老白死的龙在一年前被冰霜巨人杀死。她将水边冰架上的一堆鲸鱼和海豹的骨头描述为那个怪物的全部遗物。除此之外，这些骨头被描述为该地区怪物捕食者的证据。",
	"While Barking Seal and Bonecarver speak with the adventurers, the other members of the tribe circle around the party, frowning and muttering as the dogs growl. Eight warriors lope off with their weapons toward the icy staircase and the ice shelf below, where they keep a cautious eye on {@i Frostskimmr}. Wizards, sorcerers, and warlocks among the party attract scornful looks. Do your best to communicate an atmosphere of tense hostility to the players.": "当 \"吠叫海豹 \"和 \"波纳佛 \"与冒险者交谈时，部落的其他成员围着队伍转，在狗的咆哮声中皱着眉头，嘀咕着。八个战士拿着武器向冰冷的楼梯和下面的冰架蹒跚而去，他们在那里谨慎地注视着（%0%）。队伍中的魔法师、巫师和术士都吸引了鄙夷的目光。尽力向玩家传达一种紧张的敌对气氛。",
	"Any crew member accompanying the characters can point out that this behavior is highly unusual. Though the Ice Hunters avoid contact with outsiders, they are almost never hostile.": "任何陪同人物的船员都可以指出，这种行为是非常不寻常的。虽然猎冰人避免与外人接触，但他们几乎从不敌视。",
	"During this interaction, allow the characters to attempt DC 20 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks. A character who succeeds notices several villagers slipping away one by one and disappearing into the meeting hall. From the hall, the villagers descend into the ice caves to warn Arauthator's servants that strangers have come, then quickly slip back up to the surface.": "在这个互动过程中，允许角色尝试DC20智慧（（%0%））检查。成功的角色注意到几个村民一个接一个地溜走，消失在会议厅里。从大厅里，村民们下到冰洞里，警告Arauthator的仆人有陌生人前来，然后迅速溜回地面。",
	"Encounters in the ice caves assume that the presence of intruders on the iceberg is already known. If the party has maintained stealth since they arrived, they have a chance to surprise creatures in the ice caves.": "在冰洞中的遭遇假定已经知道冰山上有入侵者的存在。如果队伍在抵达后一直保持隐身状态，他们就有机会让冰洞中的生物感到惊讶。",
	"The Ice Hunters are determined not to allow the strangers inside the village hall, where they might discover the entrance to the ice caves. They know that letting powerful adventurers get past them into the dragon's lair means torture or death for every adult and child of the tribe.": "猎冰人决心不允许陌生人进入村庄大厅，因为他们可能会在那里发现冰洞的入口。他们知道，让强大的冒险者越过他们进入龙的巢穴，意味着对部落的每一个成人和儿童都是折磨或死亡。",
	"As they stall for time, Barking Seal, Bonecarver, and Orcaheart are also sizing up the adventurers' strength. If the characters refuse to leave the iceberg, Barking Seal proposes a contest: the village's champion against any warrior among the strangers. If the champion wins, the characters must hand over some of their fine steel weapons and sail away immediately, never to return. If the adventurer wins, the strangers will have earned their place among the villagers. They can spend the night in the village, after which Bonecarver will answer their questions to the best of her ability.": "在拖延时间的同时，Barking Seal、Bonecarver和Orcaheart也在衡量冒险家们的实力。如果角色们拒绝离开冰山，Barking Seal提议进行一场比赛：村里的冠军对阵陌生人中的任何一个战士。如果冠军赢了，人物必须交出他们的一些精钢武器，并立即驶离，不再回来。如果冒险家赢了，陌生人就会在村民中赢得自己的地位。他们可以在村子里过夜，之后波纳弗会尽其所能回答他们的问题。",
	"If the characters agree to the duel, one of them must fight Orcaheart one-on-one. No magic is allowed, but if the character possesses a magic weapon or magic armor with no obvious effects, the villagers are unlikely to notice. The fight continues until one contestant is {@condition unconscious} and dying. (Allow Orcaheart to make death saving throws if he drops to 0 hit points.) At that point, the match ends and each combatant's allies can step in to provide healing and assistance.": "如果角色同意决斗，他们中的一个必须与奥卡心一对一地战斗。不允许使用魔法，但如果角色拥有一件没有明显效果的魔法武器或魔法盔甲，村民们不太可能注意到。战斗继续进行，直到有一个参赛者{@condition unconscious}并死亡。(如果Orcaheart的命中率降到0，允许他进行死亡拯救。)在这一点上，比赛结束，每个战斗人员的盟友可以介入提供治疗和援助。",
	"During the fight, a combatant forfeits if he or she gains assistance of any kind from allies. Despite this, however, Bonecarver aids Orcaheart during the fight if she can. She positions herself so that when he is struck, he can fall backward and land in front of her. When she helps him back onto his feet, she surreptitiously casts {@spell cure wounds}. If a player states specifically that a character is watching the crowd for signs of interference, that character can attempt a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. Success means that Bonecarver was spotted in the act, though she denies providing assistance if accused of cheating.": "在战斗中，如果战斗者从盟友那里获得任何形式的援助，那么他或她就会放弃。然而，尽管如此，波纳弗在战斗中还是尽可能地帮助奥卡心。她摆好姿势，当他被击中时，他可以向后倒下，落在她面前。当她帮助他重新站起来的时候，她偷偷地施放了（%0%）。如果有玩家特别说明某个角色正在观察人群中的干扰迹象，该角色可以尝试进行DC15智慧（（%1%））检查。成功意味着博纳弗的行为被发现了，尽管如果被指控作弊，她会否认提供帮助。",
	"If Orcaheart loses the match, the Ice Hunters go through the motions of honoring their pledge. They offer to let the characters sleep in the village storage hut, which barely qualifies as shelter. Bonecarver brings them a platter of slightly spoiled raw fish, explaining (truthfully) that her people prefer the tanginess of meat that's gone past its prime. The fish won't hurt characters who eat it—but the poison Bonecarver added to it will. The sharp tang of the fish covers the bitter poison so well that a successful DC 20 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check or DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check is needed to detect it.": "如果Orcaheart输掉了比赛，猎冰人就会去履行他们的承诺。他们提出让这些人物睡在村里的储藏室里，这几乎不能算作住所。博纳弗给他们带来了一盘略微变质的生鱼，解释说（如实）她的族人更喜欢已经过了黄金期的肉的味道。这条鱼不会伤害吃它的人，但博纳卡弗在里面添加的毒药会伤害他们。鱼的尖锐味道很好地掩盖了苦涩的毒药，需要成功地进行DC20智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查或DC15智力（{@skill Investigation}）检查才能发现它。",
	"Any character who eats the poisoned fish must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. Failure means the character takes 13 ({@dice 3d8}) poison damage and becomes {@condition unconscious} for 8 hours. On a successful save, the character takes 9 ({@dice 2d8}) poison damage. If all the characters are rendered {@condition unconscious} by the poison, they are tied up and carried down to area 1 in the ice caves, where they awaken to see 5 {@creature Ice Toad|RoT|ice toads} (see {@adventure appendix D|RoT|12}) examining their belongings.": "任何吃了毒鱼的角色都必须做一个DC15的宪法救赎动作。失败意味着该角色会受到13({@dice 3d8})的中毒伤害，并在8小时内变成{@condition unconscious}。救赎成功时，角色会受到9({@dice 2d8})的中毒伤害。如果所有的角色都被毒药弄得{@condition unconscious}，他们就会被捆绑起来，并被带到冰洞的1号区域，在那里他们会醒来看到5个{@creature Ice Toad|RoT|ice toads}（见{@adventure appendix D|RoT|12}）在检查他们的物品。",
	"Of all the Ice Hunters, Bonecarver is the only one whose favor the characters have any chance of winning. She does not initially trust the adventurers, and is as keen to see them depart Oyaviggaton as the rest of her people. However, she knows that the Ice Hunters will eventually perish under Arauthator's wrath, and she has long dreamed that the totem spirits will send heroes with the strength to best the dragon.": "在所有的猎冰人中，博纳卡弗是唯一一个人物有机会赢得其青睐的人。她一开始并不信任这些冒险者，并且和其他的人一样热衷于看到他们离开奥雅维格顿。然而，她知道猎冰者最终会在阿劳特的愤怒下灭亡，而且她长期以来一直梦想图腾之灵会派出有实力的英雄来打败龙。",
	"With effective roleplaying and a DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check, Bonecarver will meet privately with the adventurers and speak the truth of her people's plight. A druid, ranger, or some other character who can truthfully express an understanding of the shaman's animal totem-based faith has advantage on this check. Bonecarver is not willing to risk the lives of her tribesfolk in a battle against the dragon.

	"Beneath the village lies a network of ice caves inhabited by Arauthator and his minions. Two entrances lead into the caves from the village: one hidden inside the meeting hall and the other inside the shaman's hut.

	"Arauthator has attracted a number of ice toads to Oyaviggaton, where they help to maintain the iceberg and the dragon's many treasures and trophies. The ice toads are good at this job, thanks to their exceptionally intelligent leader, {@creature Marfulb|RoT}.": "Arauthator吸引了许多冰蟾蜍来到奥亚维加顿，它们帮助维护冰山和龙的许多宝藏和战利品。冰蟾蜍很擅长这项工作，这要归功于他们异常聪明的领袖，（%0%）。",
	"Feeding on seals, sea birds, and fish caught for them by the Ice Hunters, Oyaviggaton's ice toads are not automatically hostile to strangers. Once characters get inside Arauthator's lair, they might find that these creatures can be helpful to their quest. Ice toads normally speak only their own obscure language. Those in Oyaviggaton know a little Draconic and Uluik (the language of the Ice Hunters), but their accents are thick and their pronunciation atrocious. {@creature Marfulb|RoT} is fluent in Draconic thanks to many hours spent conversing with Arauthator.": "奥亚维加顿的冰蟾蜍以海豹、海鸟和猎冰人为食，对陌生人不会自动产生敌意。一旦人物进入阿劳特的巢穴，他们可能会发现这些生物会对他们的探索有所帮助。冰蟾蜍通常只说自己的晦涩语言。Oyaviggaton的人知道一点Draconic和Uluik（冰雪猎人的语言），但他们的口音很重，发音很难听。{@creature Marfulb|RoT}由于与Arauthator交谈了很多时间，所以能说一口流利的Draconic语。",
	"When the characters encounter ice toads, their intelligence won't be apparent until they act or attempt to speak. Even then, characters might not recognize the ice toads' croaking as language. Ice toads move on all fours, but their webbed front feet are surprisingly dexterous. Some carry tools and useful items in pouches slung around their necks.": "当人物遇到冰蟾蜍时，他们的智力不会被发现，直到他们采取行动或试图说话。即使如此，角色们也未必能认出冰蟾的呱呱叫声是语言。冰蟾以四肢移动，但它们有蹼的前脚却出奇的灵巧。有些冰蟾将工具和有用的物品放在脖子上的袋子里。",

	"The floors inside the iceberg are worn glass-smooth from decades of traffic. Arauthator, the ice trolls, and the ice toads move across the slick ice with ease thanks to claws and bony spurs on their feet that give them traction.

The cloak is fastened with a silver-and-ivory brooch bearing a design reminiscent of a stylized, branching tree—the symbol of the Arcane Brotherhood. Two kobold attendants stand nearby, glancing nervously between you and the tiefling. After a few moments, the tiefling looks up with an expression of pale disinterest and asks, \"Have you come to save me or kill me?

	"When Maccath arrived at Oyaviggaton three years ago, Arauthator would normally have killed her without a second thought. However, the brooch of the Arcane Brotherhood she wore suggested to Arauthator that the tiefling might present a solution to two problems. First, the dragon possessed numerous items stolen from the Arcane Brotherhood, some of which defied his understanding even after decades of study. Second, Arauthator had long sought to help his mate Arveiaturace overcome her grief over the death of the wizard she once served. Replacing that wizard with a member of the Arcane Brotherhood seemed a perfect solution.": "三年前，当马卡斯来到奥亚维加顿时，Arauthator通常会不假思索地杀死她。然而，她佩戴的奥术兄弟会的胸针向Arauthator建议，这个铁皮人可能是两个问题的解决方案。首先，这条龙拥有许多从奥术兄弟会那里偷来的物品，其中一些物品即使经过几十年的研究也让他无法理解。第二，Arauthator长期以来一直试图帮助他的伴侣Arveiaturace克服她对她曾经服务的巫师的死亡的悲痛。用一个奥术兄弟会的成员取代那个巫师似乎是一个完美的解决方案。",
	"Maccath was smart enough to convince the dragon that his offer had won her over, expecting that she would eventually be able to seek a means of escape from the iceberg. However, she has so far been thwarted by Arauthator's potent magic—including spells and rituals stolen from the Arcane Brotherhood—which have kept her sealed and helpless in Oyaviggaton, invisible to scrying and unable to use {@spell sending} to call for help. Before he turns Maccath over to Arveiaturace, Arauthator has had the tiefling deciphering his stolen writings, though the work has gone slowly thanks to the inherent complexity and danger of the material. Maccath is studying one of the stolen scrolls when the characters walk in.": "马卡斯很聪明，他说服了龙，他的提议赢得了她，期望她最终能够寻求一种逃离冰山的方法。然而，到目前为止，她一直被阿罗伊特的强大魔法--包括从奥术兄弟会偷来的咒语和仪式--所挫败，这些魔法使她被封印在奥亚维加顿而无能为力，对窥探术不可见，也无法使用（%0%）来呼救。在他把马卡思交给阿尔维雅图拉斯之前，阿罗伊特让这个盗贼破译他偷来的文字，尽管由于这些材料本身的复杂性和危险性，这项工作进展缓慢。当这些人物走进来时，马卡斯正在研究其中一份被盗的卷轴。",
	"If the characters announced their presence by fighting the {@creature ice troll|RoT}, the 2 {@creature Kobold||kobolds} will be visibly agitated, even though Maccath shows little concern. The kobolds have been directed to stay with the tiefling and follow her orders, which mostly means undertaking errands to the scriptorium (area 11).

The trolls might flee without a word, or they might decide they like Oyaviggaton and make it their permanent home.": "{@b If Arauthator is killed}，冰蟾蜍很悲伤，但它们不会对角色采取任何行动。与此相反，哥布林因悲痛而暴怒，以狂热的、自杀式的攻击方式向角色投掷。冰巨魔的反应可能会受到角色们之前与他们的互动的影响。巨魔可能一言不发地逃走，也可能决定喜欢奥亚维加顿并把它作为自己的永久家园。",
	"The Ice Hunters are elated over the dragon's death. When the characters emerge from the iceberg, the normally reserved villagers greet them with cheers and offers of the choicest fermented fish. The villagers then begin packing their few belongings into their hide boats and prepare to leave immediately.": "猎冰人对龙的死亡感到欣喜。当这些人物从冰山中走出来时，平时矜持的村民们欢呼着迎接他们，并提供了最美味的发酵鱼。然后，村民们开始把他们为数不多的财物装进他们的皮船，准备立即离开。",
	"{@b If Arauthator is wounded and driven off}, Maccath or {@creature Marfulb|RoT} know enough of the dragon to predict that he will spend months recovering at one of his other lairs before returning to Oyaviggaton. The Ice Hunters believe that this gives them enough time to lose themselves in the vast expanse of the Sea of Moving Ice and find a new home where Arauthator can't track them. The dragon is vengeful, but with everything else going on, Maccath believes Arauthator won't put any real effort into seeking out his former thralls. The Ice Hunters have no contact with civilization, so they can't possibly spread word of his humiliating defeat.": "{@b If Arauthator is wounded and driven off}, Maccath或{@creature Marfulb|RoT}对龙的了解足以预测他在返回奥亚维加顿之前会在他的一个其他巢穴中度过几个月的恢复期。猎冰人认为，这使他们有足够的时间在广袤的移动冰海中迷失自我，并在阿罗伊特无法追踪他们的地方找到一个新家。这条龙是报复性的，但由于发生了其他事情，马卡斯相信阿劳特不会花任何真正的精力去寻找他以前的王族。猎冰者与文明社会没有联系，所以他们不可能传播他的耻辱性失败的消息。",
	"With the dragon's disappearance, the kobolds hide if they can, while the ice toads demonstrate the same impassive stoicism they show if the dragon is killed. The ice trolls shy away from Arauthator's treasure as long as he is alive, knowing better than to come between a dragon and its hoard. They don't really care if someone else plunders items from the dragon's hoard, and they're too stupid to think they might be blamed for any such thefts.": "随着龙的消失，哥布林们尽可能地躲藏起来，而冰蟾蜍则表现出与龙被杀时一样的无动于衷。只要Arauthator还活着，冰巨魔就对他的财宝敬而远之，因为他们知道最好不要在龙和它的囤积物之间来回穿梭。他们并不关心是否有其他人从龙的囤积物中掠夺物品，而且他们太愚蠢了，认为自己可能会因为任何此类盗窃而受到指责。",
	"The characters have no chance to sail away from the iceberg aboard {@i Frostskimmr} while Arauthator is free to attack. The dragon can strike just as easily from the sky or from beneath the water, freezing or capsizing the ship, then picking off the crew at his leisure. If the adventurers try to sneak away with Maccath, the sorcerer's absence is noticed by the kobolds and ice toads within a day.": "当Arauthator可以自由攻击时，人物没有机会从冰山上驶离（%0%）。这条龙可以很容易地从天上或水底发动攻击，冻结或击沉船只，然后在他的闲暇时挑走船员。如果冒险者试图带着马卡思溜走，巫师的缺席在一天之内就会被哥布林和冰蟾蜍发现。",
	"If Arauthator was beaten in combat and forced to retreat, he will not pursue {@i Frostskimmr} as the characters sail away. The adventurers and the crew might see the dragon shadowing them in the far distance, but Arauthator is too proud and fearful to face the party again.": "如果Arauthator在战斗中被击败并被迫撤退，那么当人物扬长而去时，他将不会追击（%0%）。冒险者和船员们可能会看到龙在远处的影子，但Arauthator太过骄傲和恐惧，不敢再面对队伍。",
	"If Old White Death is killed or driven away, he leaves his iceberg lair's treasure hoard behind. (Because Oyaviggaton is just one of a number of minor lairs maintained by the dragon, the treasure here represents only the smallest part of his total wealth.)": "如果老白死被杀或被赶走，他就会把他的冰山巢穴的财宝囤积起来。(因为奥亚维加顿只是巨龙维护的若干小巢穴之一，这里的宝藏只代表他总财富的最小部分)。",
	"Areas 19 and 20 contain a total of 700 gp, 1,000 sp, and 20 precious stones (five each worth 200 gp, 400 gp, 600 gp, and 800 gp). In addition, add potions, scrolls, and magic items at your discretion. Alternatively, use the {@book treasure tables|DMG|7|Treasure Tables} in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} to generate a hoard whose value is in line with your campaign.": "19区和20区共有700金币、1,000英镑和20块宝石（每块宝石价值200金币、400金币、600金币和800金币）。此外，可酌情添加药水、卷轴和魔法物品。或者，使用{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中的{@book treasure tables|DMG|7|Treasure Tables}来生成一个价值与你的活动相一致的囤积物。",
	"To claim this treasure, it must be hacked out of the ice in the lair cavern. Doing so takes half a day (and is thus impossible if Arauthator is still in the lair).": "要想得到这个宝藏，必须把它从巢穴的冰层中砍出来。这样做需要半天时间（因此，如果阿劳特还在巢穴中，就不可能做到）。",
	"{@creature Marfulb|RoT}'s four decades of data on Arauthator is priceless to the Arcane Brotherhood (a fact Maccath will recognize if the characters don't) or to other collectors of draconic lore. If the dragon is dead, {@creature Marfulb|RoT} can be talked into letting this material be transported south, provided she gets to come along. If Arauthator still lives, the ice toad would prefer to stay and continue her work with her records intact.": "{@creature Marfulb|RoT}四十年来关于Arauthator的资料对奥术兄弟会来说是无价之宝（如果角色不认识，Maccath会认识到这一点），对其他龙族传说的收集者来说也是如此。如果龙已经死了，{@creature Marfulb|RoT}可以被说服让这些材料被运往南方，只要她能一起去。如果Arauthator还活着，冰蟾更愿意留下来继续她的工作，并保留她的记录。",
	"Arauthator is a strong ally of the Cult of the Dragon, and the adventurers deal a solid blow to the cult by defeating him. Additionally, by returning Maccath and the stolen lore of the Hosttower, the characters can earn the allegiance of the Arcane Brotherhood in the fight against the cult's plans.": "Arauthator是神龙教的强大盟友，冒险者们通过击败他给神龙教带来了沉重的打击。此外，通过归还马卡思和被盗的主塔传说，人物可以在对抗邪教计划的斗争中赢得奥术兄弟会的效忠。",

	"This section comprises two distinct chapters. In the first chapter, the characters track {@creature Varram|RoT}, keeper of the {@item White Dragon Mask|RoTOS}, to an ancient crypt overrun by yuan-ti in the Serpent Hills. In the second chapter, the adventurers go up against {@creature Neronvain|RoT}, wyrmspeaker of the {@item Green Dragon Mask|RoTOS}, in a hidden stronghold and dragon lair in the Misty Forest. These chapters play out at different points during the first and second sessions of the Council of Waterdeep, but are presented together because they form two halves of a single mission—taking the fight to the wyrmspeakers as a means of thwarting {@creature Severin|RoT}'s plots.": "本节包括两个不同的章节。在第一章中，人物追踪{@item White Dragon Mask|RoTOS}的守卫者{@creature Varram|RoT}，来到蛇山中被元帝占领的古老墓穴。在第二章中，冒险者在迷雾森林的一个隐藏据点和龙穴中与{@creature Neronvain|RoT}，{@item Green Dragon Mask|RoTOS}的巫师对话。这些章节在水底议会的第一和第二届会议期间的不同时间点上进行，但由于它们构成了一个任务的两个部分--向巫术师作战，作为挫败{@creature Severin|RoT}阴谋的一种手段，所以被一起介绍。",

They do not manifest again if destroyed.": "这个区域由3个{@creature Wraith||wraiths}和3个{@creature Specter||specters}守卫。这些裹尸人是那些将自己的灵魂许配给（%2%）以换取巫师的异域知识的战士的魂魄。他们可以在战斗中被击败，但他们的灵魂被古老的魔法束缚在房间里，导致他们在被摧毁24小时后再次显现出来。这些亡灵是三个死在这里的邪教徒和三个在废墟中死去的元老的灵魂的复活。如果被摧毁，它们就不会再显现出来。",

Each of the goblets can be used to produce this effect once per seven days.": "床边的银制陶器和四个高脚杯是有魔力的。如果一个角色从空的银壶中倒入一个空的高脚杯中，一种发烟的气体会在两个容器之间流动。从充满气体的高脚杯中 \"喝 \"下去的人，在3小时内对毒药和毒药伤害的抵抗有优势。每个高脚杯每七天可以产生一次这种效果。",
