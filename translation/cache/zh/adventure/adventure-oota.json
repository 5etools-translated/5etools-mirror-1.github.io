	"Deep beneath the surface of the world lies the Underdark, a realm of endless labyrinthine tunnels and caverns where the sun never shines. The Underdark is filled with races and creatures too numerous to count or list, and foremost among these are the dark elves—the drow. Hated and feared even by their fellow dwellers in darkness, the drow raid other settlements in the Underdark as well as the surface world, taking prisoners back with them. Rendered {@condition unconscious} with drow poison, then collared and shackled, these prisoners are eventually sold as slaves or entertainment in the dark elves' subterranean cities.": "在世界表面之下的深处是暗黑世界，一个由无尽的迷宫般的隧道和洞穴组成的领域，太阳从不照耀。黑暗世界充满了众多的种族和生物，数也数不清，其中最重要的是黑暗精灵--乌鸦。乌鸦甚至被他们在黑暗中的同伴所憎恨和恐惧，他们袭击了暗黑世界的其他定居点以及表面世界，并将囚犯带回去。这些囚犯被施以鸦人的毒药，然后被戴上项圈和镣铐，最终被卖到黑暗精灵的地下城市作为奴隶或娱乐。",
	"The adventurers have all had the misfortune of falling to such a fate. Captured by the drow, they are prisoners at one of the dark elves' outposts, awaiting transportation to Menzoberranzan, the City of Spiders. Whether they came into the Underdark seeking knowledge or fortune, or were just in the wrong place at the wrong time, they were ripe prey for a drow raid.": "冒险家们都曾不幸落入这样的命运。他们被乌鸦俘虏，在黑暗精灵的某个前哨站成为囚犯，等待被送往蜘蛛之城门索布兰赞。无论他们是来暗黑世界寻求知识或财富，还是在错误的时间出现在错误的地点，他们都是乌鸦突袭的成熟猎物。",
	"The setup of {@i Out of the Abyss} is such that the characters need have no connections with events in the Underdark, or with each other, prior to the start of the adventure. They can meet and get to know each other as prisoners of the drow. Players who would like their characters to have a stronger Underdark connection can choose from the background options in {@adventure appendix A|OotA|17}.": "{@i Out of the Abyss}的设置是这样的：在冒险开始之前，人物不需要与暗黑世界的事件或彼此之间有任何联系。他们可以作为乌鸦的俘虏来认识和了解对方。如果玩家希望他们的角色与暗黑世界有更强的联系，可以从{@adventure appendix A|OotA|17}的背景选项中选择。",
	"\"Prisoners of the Drow\" assumes the characters start at 1st level, and that they will achieve 2nd level (if not 3rd) by the end of this chapter of the adventure. Given the challenges of the adventure and the dangers of the Underdark, you can start the characters at a higher level (2nd or 3rd) to make things a bit easier for the players.": "\"乌鸦的囚徒 \"假设角色从1级开始，在冒险的这一章结束时他们将达到2级（如果不是3级）。考虑到冒险的挑战和地下城的危险，你可以让角色从更高的等级开始（2级或3级），让玩家更容易一些。",
	"The characters' goal in this chapter of the adventure is straightforward: escape from the drow outpost of Velkynvelve, with an eye toward escaping from the Underdark. However, this goal is complicated by the adventurers' lack of familiarity with their surroundings. Even if the prisoners can get away from the drow, where will they go and how will they survive?": "在这一章的冒险中，人物的目标很直接：从维尔基维尔的乌鸦前哨逃出，并着眼于逃离暗黑世界。然而，由于冒险者们对周围环境的不熟悉，这个目标变得很复杂。即使囚犯们能够摆脱乌鸦，他们将去哪里，如何生存？",
	"All the drow's prisoners, including the characters, wear iron slave collars along with manacles connected to iron belts by a short length of chain. This leaves the prisoners {@condition restrained}, but doesn't affect their movement or speed.": "所有乌鸦的囚犯，包括人物在内，都戴着铁制的奴隶项圈，以及用短链连接到铁质腰带的手铐。这让囚犯们（%0%），但并不影响他们的行动和速度。",
	"In addition to being manacled, spellcasters don't have any spell components or focuses, initially limiting their spellcasting ability. (Wizard characters don't need their spellbooks to cast spells, but will be unable to change their prepared spells without them. As such, give wizard characters some leeway in determining which spells they had previously prepared before being captured.) Moreover, spellcasting isn't possible inside the slave pen because of its magical wards (see area 11).": "除了被戴上手铐外，施法者没有任何法术组件或焦点，最初限制了他们的施法能力。(巫师角色不需要他们的法术书来施法，但没有法术书将无法改变他们准备的法术）。因此，在确定他们在被俘之前准备了哪些法术时，要给巫师角色一些余地）。此外，由于奴隶营内有魔法屏障，所以施法是不可能的（见区域11）。",
	"Slipping out of manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check, while breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. A character can unlock the manacles using thieves' tools with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. The manacles have 15 hit points. The iron collars can be broken with a successful DC 20 Strength check. The collars have 12 hit points. A character who fails a check to break a collar, break a set of manacles, or escape from a set of manacles can't attempt checks of that kind again until he or she finishes a long rest. A character can still use the {@action Help} action to aid another character, however.": "溜出手铐需要成功地进行DC20灵巧检查，而打破手铐则需要成功地进行DC20力量检查。一个角色可以用盗贼的工具解开手铐，但需要成功地进行DC 15的灵巧检查。手铐有15个打击点。铁领子可以通过成功的DC20力量检查来打破。项圈有12点生命值。一个角色如果在挣脱项圈、挣脱一套手铐或从一套手铐中逃脱的检查中失败，在他或她完成长时间的休息之前，不能再尝试此类检查。然而，一个角色仍然可以使用{@action Help}动作来帮助另一个角色。",
	"The characters begin the adventure in the slave pens of Velkynvelve. Stripped of everything but their underclothing, they are at the mercy of the dark elves and in the company of other prisoners, many of who aren't what they seem.": "角色们在Velkynvelve的奴隶牢房里开始冒险。他们被剥夺了所有的东西，只剩下内衣，任由黑暗精灵摆布，与其他囚犯为伍，其中许多人并不像他们看起来那样。",
	"Captured by the drow! You wouldn't wish this fate upon anyone, yet here you are—locked in a dark cave, the cold, heavy weight of metal tight around your throat and wrists. You are not alone. Other prisoners are trapped in here with you, in an underground outpost far from the light of the sun. Your captors include a cruel drow priestess who calls herself Mistress Ilvara of House Mizzrym. Over the past several days, you've met her several times, robed in silken garments and flanked by two male drow, one of whom has a mass of scars along one side of his face and neck. Mistress Ilvara likes to impress her will with scourge in hand and remind you that your life now belongs to her. \"Accept your fate, learn to obey, and you may survive.\" Her words echo in your memory, even as you plot your escape.": "被乌鸦抓走了！你不希望任何人遭受这种命运。你不希望任何人遭受这种命运，但你现在却被锁在一个黑暗的山洞里，冰冷、沉重的金属紧紧箍住你的喉咙和手腕。你并不孤单。其他囚犯和你一起被困在这里，在一个远离阳光的地下哨所。俘虏你的人包括一个残酷的鸦人女祭司，她自称是米兹林家族的伊尔瓦拉女主人。在过去的几天里，你见过她好几次，她身穿丝质服装，身旁有两个男性乌鸦，其中一个的脸部和脖子一侧有大量的伤疤。女主人伊尔瓦拉喜欢用手中的鞭子打动她的意志，并提醒你，你的生命现在属于她了。\"接受你的命运，学会服从，你就可能活下来。\" 她的话在你的记忆中回响，甚至在你策划逃跑的时候。",
	"Assume that each player character has been a prisoner in Velkynvelve for {@dice 1d10} days. (Roll separately for each character.)

	"Feel free to play out any interaction between the drow, the player characters, and the other prisoners. This is an opportunity to reveal who the characters are and to flesh out their backgrounds and personalities through roleplaying, even as you introduce some of their fellow prisoners. Ilvara's newest consort, Shoor, wants to impress his mistress, while Jorlan, her former consort, sullenly does his duty but casts a curious eye over the prisoners. Any hostile move is met with poisoned crossbow bolts from the drow, and possibly a strike from Ilvara's scourge or a {@spell ray of sickness} spell. The giant spiders attack and poison anyone who attacks the drow. The drow don't kill any of the prisoners (leaving them {@condition unconscious} at 0 hit points) but have no compunction about beating them.": "请自由发挥乌鸦、玩家角色和其他囚犯之间的任何互动。这是一个揭示人物身份的机会，通过角色扮演来充实他们的背景和个性，甚至在你介绍他们的一些同伴的时候。伊尔瓦拉的新妃子肖尔想给他的女主人留下深刻印象，而她的前妃子乔兰则闷闷不乐地履行职责，但对囚犯们投以好奇的目光。任何有敌意的举动都会遭到乌鸦的毒弩箭的攻击，也可能是伊尔瓦拉的祸害或（%0%）法术的打击。巨型蜘蛛会攻击并毒死任何攻击乌鸦的人。乌鸦人没有杀死任何囚犯（让他们（%1%）的命中率为0），但对殴打他们却毫无怨言。",

	"The prisoners are provided with clay chamber pots, and one of the duties of slaves is to empty them into the pool during their shift. There are no other comforts in the slave pen. Prisoners must sit or lie on the stone floor, and are fed only once each day—a thin mushroom broth served in small clay bowls passed through gaps in the bars of the gate.": "囚犯们被提供了粘土箱，奴隶们的职责之一是在轮班时将其倒入水池。奴隶牢房里没有其他舒适的地方。囚犯必须坐在或躺在石板上，每天只吃一次饭--用小土碗盛着稀薄的蘑菇汤，从大门的栅栏缝隙中穿过。",

This pleasant facade conceals the soul of an insane killer. {@creature Buppido|OotA} secretly believes he is the living incarnation of the derro god Diinkarazan—an avatar of murder offering bloody sacrifices to create a path of carnage through the Underdark for his people to follow to glory. He rationalizes any setbacks (including his capture and imprisonment) as part of his \"divine plan.\" His killings are carefully ritualized, following an exacting process of cutting open the victims and arranging their organs.": "一个男性{@creature derro|MTF}，{@creature Buppido|OotA}出人意料地好客和健谈，表现出敏锐的头脑和迷人的态度。这种令人愉快的外表下隐藏着一个疯狂的杀手的灵魂。{@creature Buppido|OotA}秘密地相信他是德鲁神Diinkarazan的活生生的化身--谋杀的化身，提供血腥的牺牲，为他的人民创造一条穿越暗黑世界的屠杀之路，以获得荣耀。他把任何挫折（包括他的被捕和监禁）都合理化为他 \"神圣计划 \"的一部分。他的杀戮是仔细的仪式化的，遵循严格的过程，切开受害者并排列他们的器官。",
	"Although mad, {@creature Buppido|OotA} is cunning and capable of hiding his true nature to serve his own ends. Because he believes he is a god, he is convinced that he can't be killed (or at least that the death of his mortal form means nothing to him), so he is completely fearless. He assumes everything is part of his divine plan, and enthusiastically participates in any plot to escape from the drow so he can continue his holy work. {@creature Buppido|OotA} is happy to consider his fellow prisoners allies until such time as he no longer needs them, or becomes convinced that the omens point toward the need for one or more of them to be sacrificed to his greater glory.": "虽然疯了，但（%0%）很狡猾，能够隐藏自己的真实本性，为自己的目的服务。因为他相信自己是个神，所以他坚信自己不会被杀死（或者至少他的凡人形态的死亡对他来说毫无意义），所以他完全无畏。他认为一切都是他神圣计划的一部分，并热情地参与任何逃离乌鸦的阴谋，以便他能继续他的神圣工作。(在他不再需要他的同伴之前，他很乐意将他们视为盟友，或者确信预兆表明他们中的一个或多个需要为他更大的荣耀而牺牲掉。",

If any of the characters speak to him, however, the quaggoth replies in urbane Elvish. He explains that he is not, in fact, a quaggoth, but a gold elf prince polymorphed into quaggoth form by a curse. He claims to be {@creature Prince Derendil|OotA} of the kingdom of Nelrindenvane in the High Forest. His crown was usurped by the evil wizard Terrestor, who trapped him in this form and exiled him from his people.": "这个大块头（%0%）是奴隶营里看起来最凶猛的囚犯，其他囚犯对他敬而远之。然而，如果有任何人物和他说话，这个夸父就会用彬彬有礼的Elvish语回答。他解释说，事实上他不是夸父，而是一个被诅咒变成夸父形态的金精灵王子。他声称自己是高等森林中的奈尔林登凡王国的（1%）。他的王位被邪恶的巫师泰瑞斯托篡夺，泰瑞斯托将他困在这个形态中，并将他从他的人民中放逐。",
	"Although Derendil behaves like the highborn prince he believes himself to be, he responds to stress—and particularly threats—like a quaggoth: violently tearing foes limb from limb and rending their flesh with sharp claws and teeth. He comes back to himself only after battle, or when someone reinforces his \"true identity\" to snap him out of it. Derendil laments that he is slowly but surely losing himself to the savagery of his quaggoth form.": "虽然德兰迪尔的行为就像他认为自己是高高在上的王子，但他对压力的反应--尤其是对威胁的反应--就像夸父一样：猛烈地将敌人的肢体撕裂，用锋利的爪子和牙齿撕碎他们的肉。只有在战斗结束后，或者当有人强化他的 \"真实身份 \"使他摆脱这种状态时，他才会恢复自我。德兰迪尔哀叹说，他正在慢慢地但肯定地失去自己，被他的夸父形态的野蛮所取代。",
	"In fact, Derendil is simply mad, touched by the delusions of the demon lord Fraz-Urb'luu. The kingdom of Nelrindenvane doesn't exist, and all of \"Derendil's\" recollections and personality are an illusion created by the Demon Prince of Deception. The quaggoth refuses to believe the truth, and any incontrovertible evidence as to his real nature sends him into a murderous rage.": "事实上，Derendil只是疯了，被恶魔领主Fraz-Urb'luu的错觉所触动。内尔林登凡王国并不存在，所有 \"德兰迪尔 \"的回忆和个性都是由欺骗的恶魔王子创造的幻觉。夸父拒绝相信真相，任何关于他真实本性的无可争议的证据都会让他陷入杀戮的愤怒之中。",
	"A female shield dwarf {@creature scout} from Gauntlgrym, Eldeth is high spirited and proud of both her heritage and her people's achievement in reclaiming the ancient dwarven kingdom; she suggests Gauntlgrym as a destination to escape from the Underdark. Eldeth is stubborn and hates the drow and all other \"corrupt dark dwellers\" such as the derro and duergar.": "埃尔德斯是一个来自高特格林姆的女性盾牌矮人（%0%），她热情高涨，为她的遗产和她的人民在夺回古老的矮人王国方面取得的成就感到骄傲；她建议将高特格林姆作为逃离暗黑世界的目的地。埃尔德斯很固执，憎恨鸦人和所有其他 \"腐败的黑暗居民\"，如德鲁人和杜尔加人。",
	"Eldeth wants to get back home, but she is also defiant and self sacrificing—and therefore among the most likely prisoners to perish before getting the opportunity. If that happens, Eldeth asks a character she trusts to promise to carry word of her fate back to her family in Gauntlgrym, along with her shield and warhammer if they are recovered. This might win the characters the approval of Eldeth's kin when they later visit Gauntlgrym.": "埃尔德斯想回家，但她也是个挑衅和自我牺牲的人--因此是最有可能在得到机会之前丧生的囚犯之一。如果发生这种情况，埃尔德斯要求一个她信任的角色承诺将她的命运带回去给她在Gauntlgrym的家人，如果她的盾牌和战锤被找回来的话。这可能会使角色在以后访问Gauntlgrym时赢得Eldeth的亲属的认可。",
	"A male deep gnome {@creature spy}, {@creature Jimjar|OotA} is a feckless rogue with a devil-may-care attitude, a fondness for coin, and an obsession with betting on virtually anything and everything.

He sometimes uses betting to goad others into doing things, but characters can easily turn the tables knowing that {@creature Jimjar|OotA} finds it difficult to refuse a wager. His behavior is unusual for the dour deep gnomes, and others of his kind (including {@creature Topsy|OotA} and {@creature Turvy|OotA}) find {@creature Jimjar|OotA} annoying at best, and unstable and potentially mad at worst.": "一个男性深地精（%0%），（%1%）是一个无精打采的流氓，有一种不顾一切的态度，喜欢钱币，并且痴迷于在几乎所有事情上打赌。一旦他认识了这些人物，{@creature Jimjar|OotA}就经常为他们提供赌注，从他们自己的努力（\"我赌10个金币，你不能在不被发现的情况下通过那个哨兵\"）到随机事件的结果（\"我赌20个金币，这个隧道是正确的\"）。他有时会用打赌来诱导别人做事，但人物很容易翻脸，因为知道（3%）发现很难拒绝赌注。他的行为对于沉闷的深山地精来说是不寻常的，他的其他同类（包括{@creature Topsy|OotA}和{@creature Turvy|OotA}）发现{@creature Jimjar|OotA}充其量是很烦人，最糟糕的是不稳定，可能会发疯。",
	"{@creature Jimjar|OotA} is always true to his word, and he manages to keep exact track of his debits and credits in his head, paying up on his bets (or demanding payment) as soon as possible. He's not above pocketing a little extra coin when no one is watching, and he has an amazing ability to secret significant wealth on his person.": "{@creature Jimjar|OotA}总是言出必行，他设法在脑子里准确地记录下他的借贷情况，尽快付清他的赌注（或要求付款）。他不惜在没人注意的情况下多掏一点钱，而且他有一种惊人的能力，可以将大量的财富藏在自己身上。",

He does his best to get along with everyone, although some find his gregariousness and constant wagers grating.": "{@creature Jimjar|OotA}觉得这对双胞胎{@creature Topsy|OotA}和{@creature Turvy|OotA}好像有些奇怪，但除非被问到，否则他不会发表自己的意见。他尽力与每个人相处，尽管有些人觉得他的好客和不断的赌注令人厌烦。",
	"A male {@creature orc} from the Iceshield tribe, {@creature Ront|OotA} fled from the slaughter of a band of orcs at the hands of the dwarves, falling down a shaft and wandering in the Underdark before being captured by the drow. He's ashamed of his cowardly act and knows that Gruumsh, the god of the orcs, is punishing him. But he also doesn't want to die, or at least not in drow captivity. {@creature Ront|OotA} is mean, stupid, and hateful, but he also knuckles under to authority and threats.

He is aware of his people's well-deserved reputation for madness, and claims to have spent a lifetime in contemplation and solitary meditation to overcome that legacy.

Infected with the curse of lycanthropy, neither deep gnome has entirely embraced it yet, and they struggle to control their wererat instincts and urges. They are fearful of what potential allies might do if they learn the truth, and are looking out for each other and their own survival. With their transformations controlled by the unseen cycle of the moon, you can use the twins' impending change as a wild card in the adventure. They've been prisoners for less than a month, meaning the full moon is coming.": "{@creature Topsy|OotA}和{@creature Turvy|OotA}隐藏了他们是{@creature Wererat||wererats}的事实。感染了狼人的诅咒，两个深山地精都还没有完全接受它，他们努力控制自己的狼人本能和冲动。他们害怕潜在的盟友在得知真相后会做出什么事来，他们正在为彼此和自己的生存着想。由于他们的转变受到看不见的月亮周期的控制，你可以把这对双胞胎即将发生的变化作为冒险中的一张底牌。他们被囚禁了不到一个月，意味着满月即将到来。",
	"The other prisoners who manage to escape with the player characters are likely to become their companions for a substantial part of the adventure, so it is good to lay the groundwork for those relationships early on. Some of the NPCs might not survive the initial escape attempt. Others might be lost to the dangers of the Underdark—or might reveal their true colors and betray the party. A few could become true companions. Keep in mind the other prisoners have their own personalities and goals, but are generally willing to cooperate for their own benefit. Their knowledge of the Underdark should encourage the player characters to keep them around at least initially.": "与玩家角色一起逃脱的其他囚犯可能会在冒险的大部分时间里成为他们的同伴，所以在早期为这些关系打下基础是很好的。有些NPC可能无法在最初的逃跑尝试中存活下来。其他人可能会在暗黑世界的危险中迷失方向，或者可能暴露出他们的真面目并背叛队伍。有几个可能成为真正的伙伴。请记住，其他囚犯有他们自己的个性和目标，但一般都愿意为自己的利益而合作。他们对暗黑世界的了解应该鼓励玩家角色至少在开始时把他们留在身边。",
	"Since managing such a large cast of NPCs can be quite involved, enlist the aid of the players if you wish, having each of them take on the role of managing one or more of the party's companions. The player generally decides what that NPC is doing, with the knowledge that you, as Dungeon Master, can overrule them as needed by the story. Not only does this make the secondary characters easier to manage, it helps the players get to know them and strengthens the bonds between the NPCs and the adventurers.": "由于管理这么多的NPC可能会很麻烦，如果你愿意的话，可以争取玩家的帮助，让他们每个人都扮演管理一个或多个聚会同伴的角色。一般来说，玩家决定该NPC在做什么，而作为地牢主管的你可以根据故事的需要否决他们。这不仅使次要角色更容易管理，而且有助于玩家了解他们，加强NPC和冒险者之间的联系。",
	"Allow the characters to freely mingle and interact with their fellow prisoners or even the drow guards, although the guards rarely talk to the \"surface-dweller scum.\" Of all the prisoners, only Eldeth and {@creature Jimjar|OotA} speak fluent Common.

	"You might wish to consult the social interaction rules in the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}, in which case the other prisoners are initially indifferent toward the characters. Handle the interactions using roleplaying, Charisma checks, or a balance of the two as best suits your group and the way the adventure unfolds.": "你可能希望参考{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}中的社会互动规则，在这种情况下，其他囚犯最初对这些角色是无动于衷的。使用角色扮演、魅力检查或两者的平衡来处理互动，这最适合你的小组和冒险的展开方式。",

	"The drow divide their prisoners into three roughly equal-sized groups and put them to work for a third of the day, supervised by the quaggoths. Their menial tasks include filling and hauling water barrels, operating the lift, cleaning any or all parts of the outpost (whether they need it or not), emptying chamber pots, food preparation and service, washing dishes, and laundry. The prisoners are also given cruel or pointless tasks to occupy them, and for the dark elves' amusement. Such labors include moving or stacking rocks, coiling ropes, and organizing supplies, with prisoners forced to redo work that doesn't meet the drow's arbitrary standards.": "乌鸦把他们的囚犯分成三个大小大致相同的小组，让他们在夸父的监督下工作一天的三分之一。他们的琐碎任务包括填充和拖动水桶、操作电梯、清洁前哨的任何或所有部分（无论他们是否需要）、清空室内的盆子、准备食物和服务、洗碗和洗衣。囚犯们也会被赋予残酷或无意义的任务，以占据他们的时间，并供黑暗精灵们娱乐。这类劳动包括移动或堆放岩石、盘绕绳索、整理物资，囚犯们被迫重做不符合乌鸦任意标准的工作。",
	"Characters might or might not work together, depending on how the drow split them up. Prisoners known to be friendly to each other are usually kept apart, and no more than two or three prisoners are allowed to work at a single task at once.": "角色可能在一起工作，也可能不在一起工作，这取决于鸦人如何将他们分开。已知彼此友好的囚犯通常会被分开，而且不允许超过两到三个囚犯同时从事一项工作。",
	"The drow and quaggoths are cruel and capricious, but also somewhat bored and looking for amusement. The quaggoths are poor conversationalists, hateful and mistrustful toward the prisoners. The drow are more inclined to talk, if only to boast of their superiority. Characters might trick them into dropping useful bits of information, such as how long the journey to Menzoberranzan is expected to take, or that the outpost is relatively close to the Darklake.": "乌鸦和食人魔残忍而任性，但也有些无聊，想找点乐子。奎格斯人不善言谈，对囚犯充满仇恨和不信任。鸦人更倾向于交谈，如果只是为了夸耀他们的优越性的话。角色可能会骗他们说出一些有用的信息，比如去门索布兰赞的旅程预计需要多长时间，或者前哨站离黑暗湖比较近。",
	"The characters' sleep in the slave pen is troubled and fitful, filled with strange dreams and disturbing images. Dark shadows seem to move and reach out toward them as the characters wander lost through endless mazes of tunnels. Oily tentacles slide to brush up against them, while a great buzzing and howling rises in the distance. Suppurating wounds burst open in clouds of spores or crawling masses of maggots or insects. At least one or more of the characters should wake in a cold sweat from these nightmares after every rest, feeling as though something is out there in the dark depths—something far worse than the drow.": "奴隶营中的人物的睡眠是混乱和不稳定的，充满了奇怪的梦和令人不安的图像。当人物在无尽的隧道迷宫中迷失方向时，黑暗的阴影似乎在移动，并向他们伸出手来。油腻的触手滑向他们，而远处传来巨大的嗡嗡声和嚎叫。化脓的伤口在孢子云或爬行的蛆虫或昆虫群中爆裂开来。每次休息后，至少有一个或多个角色应该从这些噩梦中惊醒，感觉好像有什么东西在黑暗的深处--远比乌鸦更可怕。",
	"You need not explain the cause of these dreams and images at this time. Characters can chalk them up to the conditions in the slave pen, or to the aftereffects of drow poison, but they are omens of what is happening in the Underdark. Spellcasters, particularly clerics and warlocks, might be most prone to these dreams, but they can visit any or all of the characters.": "你现在不需要解释这些梦和图像的原因。角色们可以把它们归结为奴隶监狱的条件，或归结为鸦人毒药的后遗症，但它们是暗黑世界正在发生的事情的预兆。施法者，尤其是牧师和术士，可能最容易做这些梦，但它们可以拜访任何或所有角色。",
	"Most of the other prisoners aren't looking for trouble, and even killers such as {@creature Buppido|OotA} are careful to bide their time. Still, both Derendil and {@creature Ront|OotA} have quick tempers, and Sarith the drow is prone to bouts of violence as Zuggtmoy's spores take over his mind. It's possible the characters could provoke a fight. If they do, some of the prisoners (including the deep gnomes) egg on the fighters while others keep their distance or even try to break up the brawl.": "大多数其他的囚犯并不是在找麻烦，即使是像{@creature Buppido|OotA}这样的杀手也会小心翼翼地等待时机。不过，德兰迪尔和(1%)都有急躁的脾气，而乌鸦人萨利斯在祖格莫伊的孢子占据他的头脑时，很容易发生暴力行为。这些人物有可能挑起一场战斗。如果他们这样做了，一些囚犯（包括深层地精）就会对战士们大打出手，而其他人则会保持距离，甚至试图打破争吵的局面。",
	"Any violent conflict draws the attention of the drow guards, who initially order any prisoners to stand down from a fight, threatening them with hand crossbows from outside the gate. If necessary, they shoot prisoners with poisoned crossbow bolts to incapacitate them. (See {@book chapter 8|DMG|8|Poisons} of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide} for information on drow poison.) The guards let any fight play out for their own amusement as long as the prisoners don't seem likely to actually kill one another.": "任何暴力冲突都会引起鸦人守卫的注意，他们最初会命令任何囚犯从战斗中退下，在门外用手弩威胁他们。如果有必要，他们会用带毒的弩箭射杀囚犯，使他们丧失能力。(关于乌鸦毒药的信息，请看{@book chapter 8|DMG|8|Poisons}的{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}。只要囚犯看起来不可能真的互相残杀，守卫们就会让任何争斗上演，供他们自己取乐。",
	"If a prisoner becomes too much trouble, or if the drow need to mete out a lesson on the price of disobedience, they make a gruesome spectacle of feeding a malcontent to the giant spiders in the webs beneath Velkynvelve. Drow guards or quaggoth servants throw the bound prisoner over the edge into the webs, where the spiders quickly converge to bite the victim, injecting their venom. Once the victim is {@condition paralyzed}, the spiders wrap their meal up in webbing.": "如果一个囚犯变得太麻烦了，或者如果鸦人需要教训一下不服从的代价，他们就会制造一个可怕的场面，把不满的人喂给Velkynvelve下面的网里的巨大蜘蛛。鸦人守卫或夸哥特仆人将被捆绑的囚犯从边缘扔进网里，蜘蛛们迅速聚集在一起，咬住受害者，注入毒液。一旦受害者被咬死（%0%），蜘蛛就会用网状物把它们的食物包裹起来。",
	"This event is a convenient opportunity to get rid of one or more of the other prisoners before the escape attempt if you don't want them around. As well, you can drive home the cruelty and threat of the drow by eliminating an NPC with whom the characters have formed a bond.": "如果你不希望其他囚犯在你身边，这个事件是一个方便的机会，可以在逃跑前除掉他们中的一个或多个。此外，你还可以通过消灭一个与角色建立了联系的NPC，让他们明白鸦人的残酷和威胁。",

	"A member of a drow house with a long history as slavers, Ilvara is a cruel mistress who enjoys taunting and tormenting enemies and underlings alike. In addition to a scourge, she wields a {@item tentacle rod}. Although she has taken Shoor Vandree as her lover, Ilvara cares no more about him than she did about Jorlan Duskryn, the lover she discarded due to his crippling injuries.": "伊尔瓦拉是一个有着悠久历史的奴隶主家族的成员，她是一个残忍的女主人，喜欢嘲弄和折磨敌人和下属。除了祸害之外，她还挥舞着一把（%0%）。虽然她把肖尔-范德里当作她的情人，但伊尔瓦拉对他的关心不亚于她对乔兰-杜斯克林的关心，后者是她因伤残而抛弃的情人。",

	"Asha is ambitious enough to know she could assume command of the outpost if anything was to happen to Ilvara, but not courageous enough to challenge her superior openly. She also knows that she would have to impress her superiors in the City of Spiders for any such field promotion to become permanent.

	"This drow elite warrior has assumed the role of Ilvara's lieutenant and lover after the injuries suffered by his predecessor, Jorlan Duskryn. Shoor is relatively young and quite arrogant for a drow male, proud of his abilities and accomplishments.

Still insecure in his position, Shoor feels the need to demonstrate his skill and effectiveness to his mistress and to find ways to please her.": "在他的前任乔兰-杜斯克林受伤后，这位鸦人精英战士承担了伊尔瓦拉的副手和情人的角色。肖尔比较年轻，作为一个鸦人男性，他相当傲慢，对自己的能力和成就感到骄傲。他还在为自己成功赢得伊尔瓦拉的青睐和提升自己在前哨站的地位而感到兴奋，这表现在他的豪迈和他对维尔基维尔其他男性的支配方式上，尤其是乔兰。肖尔对自己的地位仍然没有安全感，他觉得有必要向他的女主人展示他的技能和效率，并想办法取悦她。",

Even the lowest drow understands the inferiority of other creatures, behaving toward the prisoners like sneering nobility. With their superiors, however, the drow are fawning sycophants with a passive-aggressive edge. The males defer to the females, the rank-and-file warriors defer to the elite warriors, and everyone defers to the priestess Ilvara.": "乌鸦人傲慢、残忍、恶毒，把他们的奴隶看成不过是牲畜，对他们冷眼旁观。即使是最低级的乌鸦也明白其他生物的劣势，对囚犯的行为就像讥讽的贵族。然而，对于他们的上级，乌鸦是带着消极攻击性的媚俗的佞人。男性服从于女性，普通战士服从于精英战士，而每个人都服从于女祭司伊尔瓦拉。",

	"A {@creature gray ooze} lurks in the pool's shallows, blending perfectly with the dark, wet stone. It feeds on the waste dumped into the pool, along with the occasional creature that finds its way into the cavern or falls into the pool.": "一只{@creature gray ooze}潜伏在水池的浅滩上，与黑暗、潮湿的石头完美融合。它以倾倒在池子里的废物为食，还有偶尔发现进入洞穴或落入池中的生物。",
	"The inhabitants of Velkynvelve remain unaware that the recent arrival of the demon lord Juiblex in the Underdark has made this ooze particularly aggressive and malevolent. In addition to attacking any creature in the pool, the ooze surges up to 10 feet out of the pool to attack creatures at its edge. When it does so, creatures within 30 feet of the ooze telepathically sense a voice cry out, \"Flesh for the Faceless Lord!\"": "Velkynvelve的居民仍然不知道，最近恶魔领主Juiblex来到地下世界，使得这种渗水变得特别有侵略性和恶意。除了攻击池子里的任何生物外，这股泥浆还能从池子里涌出10英尺，攻击池子边缘的生物。当它这样做的时候，淤泥周围30英尺内的生物会通过心灵感应感觉到一个声音在呼喊：\"为无面者之主的肉体！\"",
	"Unless they want to spend the rest of their lives as drow slaves, the characters should quickly begin looking for ways they can escape. Though the task will not be easy, the characters can take advantage of certain opportunities if they use their heads.": "除非他们想一辈子做乌鸦的奴隶，否则人物应该迅速开始寻找他们可以逃跑的方法。虽然这个任务并不容易，但如果他们动脑筋的话，可以利用某些机会。",
	"One or more of the characters might have useful items in their possession (see \"Scavenged Possessions\"), and working outside the slave pen creates new opportunities for the characters to acquire and hide small items, including makeshift weapons or tools, or even lift a key to the slave pen from a guard. What they can acquire depends on the work they do and where they go. Use the description of the different locations throughout the outpost as a guide to opportunities. Taking something without being noticed requires a successful Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check contested by the Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks of any active observers, or using an observer's passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score as the base DC. A prisoner that fails the check is commanded to relinquish the item, on pain of death.": "一个或多个角色可能拥有有用的物品（见 \"拾取的财物\"），在奴隶营外工作为角色创造了新的机会，可以获得和隐藏小物品，包括临时的武器或工具，甚至可以从守卫那里取到奴隶营的钥匙。他们能获得什么，取决于他们所做的工作和他们去的地方。用整个前哨站不同地点的描述作为机会的指南。在不被注意的情况下拿东西需要成功的灵巧（（%0%））检查，由任何主动观察者的智慧（（%1%））检查来争夺，或者用观察者的被动智慧（（%2%））得分作为基础DC。检查失败的囚犯会被命令放弃该物品，否则将被处以死刑。",
	"What equipment and treasures the characters claim during their escape depend on how much of the outpost they are able to explore before fleeing. For some characters, it might be a fun challenge to escape into the Underdark with little more than the clothes on their backs. For others (including spellcasters who need spellbooks or components), consider placing the party's captured equipment (normally in Ilvara's quarters) in an alternate location if the characters are intent on escaping without exploring all of the outpost, such as the elite drow barracks (area 4) or the armory (area 10).": "角色在逃亡过程中能得到什么装备和宝物，取决于他们在逃亡前能探索多少前哨站的地方。对于一些角色来说，除了身上的衣服之外，逃到地下世界可能是一个有趣的挑战。对于其他人（包括需要法术书或组件的施法者）来说，如果角色们打算在没有探索完前哨站的情况下逃跑，可以考虑将队伍中缴获的装备（通常在伊尔瓦拉的住处）放在另一个地方，比如精英鸦人兵营（4区）或军械库（10区）。",
	"When the initial contact between the adventurers and the other prisoners has been played out, Jorlan Duskryn arranges to bring the prisoners their food during his guard duty. (Shoor delights in giving Jorlan such menial work). Standing at the gate to the slave pen and passing in bowls, he mutters to the nearest character: \"If I could give you a means to escape from here, would you take it?\"": "当冒险者和其他囚犯之间的初步接触结束后，乔兰-杜斯克林安排他在看守期间为囚犯们送去食物。(肖尔以给乔兰这样的琐碎工作为乐）。他站在通往奴隶围栏的门口，递上碗，对最近的人物嘀咕道。\"如果我可以给你一个逃离这里的方法，你会接受吗？\"",
	"If the answer is affirmative, Jorlan quickly and quietly proposes to leave the gate to the slave pen unlocked, as well as to create a distraction during the changing of the guards on duty. He tells the characters about the armory, located in the chamber above the guard post in the hanging guard tower in front of the slave pen. The escapees can jump down into the webs below, then over the edge into the pool, making their escape from there.": "如果答案是肯定的，乔兰迅速而悄悄地提议不锁上通往奴隶圈的大门，并在换岗时制造分心。他告诉人物关于军械库的情况，军械库位于奴隶围栏前的悬空警卫塔的岗哨上方的密室中。逃跑的人可以跳到下面的网里，然后从边缘跳到水池里，从那里逃跑。",
	"Jorlan doesn't particularly care if the prisoners actually escape, which is why he doesn't offer any further help or warn them about the {@creature gray ooze} in the pool. It suits him just as well if the prisoners are killed during their attempt to flee. He simply wants to create an embarrassing incident for Shoor and Ilvara.": "乔兰并不特别关心囚犯是否真的逃脱，这就是为什么他没有提供任何进一步的帮助，也没有警告他们池子里的（%0%）。如果囚犯在试图逃跑的过程中被杀，这对他来说也很合适。他只是想给肖尔和伊尔瓦拉制造一个尴尬的事件。",
	"Jorlan furtively glances around as he speaks quickly to the characters. If they question him or ask for changes to the plan, he insists it is all he can do. If they accept, he is true to his word, leaving the gate unlocked close to the next guard shift change and delaying the replacement guards for a few minutes.": "乔兰一边对人物快速说话，一边鬼鬼祟祟地四处扫视。如果他们质疑他或要求改变计划，他坚持认为这是他能做的一切。如果他们接受了，他就言出必行，在接近下一次警卫换班的时候把大门解锁，把替换的警卫推迟几分钟。",
	"During a guard change, the prisoners hear a horrible droning buzz echoing through the cavern, followed by inhuman shrieking. Alarm horns sound out as four {@creature chasme} demons pursue a pair of {@creature vrock} demons into the cavern from the northern passage. The demons swoop and buzz around, initially ignoring other creatures as both groups savagely assault each other. The demons' arrival catches all of the drow off guard.": "在换岗时，囚犯们听到可怕的嗡嗡声在洞穴里回荡，接着是非人的尖叫声。当四个{@creature chasme}恶魔追赶一对{@creature vrock}恶魔从北部通道进入洞穴时，警报喇叭响了起来。恶魔们俯冲着，嗡嗡作响，最初无视其他生物，因为两组恶魔都在野蛮地攻击对方。恶魔们的到来让所有的乌鸦都措手不及。",
	"The drow rush to defend the outpost from a possible attack. The demons initially buzz past the hanging towers, leaving the walkways and caverns out of range of the effects of their droning and screeching. However, drow and quaggoths in the towers are close enough to be affected. The aerial battle eventually circles around the platform and the towers of the elite warriors as the demons savagely tear into each other.": "乌鸦们匆匆忙忙地保卫前哨站，以免受到可能的攻击。恶魔们最初从悬空的塔楼上嗡嗡作响，将走道和洞穴排除在它们的叨叨声和尖叫声的影响范围之外。然而，塔楼里的乌鸦和夸父都很近，足以受到影响。空中战斗最终围绕着平台和精锐战士的塔楼展开，因为恶魔们野蛮地撕咬着对方。",
	"The drow move to engage the demons and defend the outpost, leaving the characters with an opportunity to escape. You can combine this event with Jorlan's offer to leave the gate unlocked, making it easy for the characters to slip away. Alternatively (or if they refuse Jorlan's offer), the characters can use the distraction to engineer their own breakout, then decide how to get down to the cavern floor and where to go after that.": "乌鸦人开始与恶魔交战并保卫前哨，给角色们留下了逃跑的机会。你可以将这一事件与乔兰的提议结合起来，让大门不上锁，让角色们很容易溜走。另外（或者如果他们拒绝了乔兰的提议），角色们可以利用这次分心来设计自己的突围，然后决定如何下到洞穴的地板上，之后去哪里。",
	"Describe the chaos of the demon attack and the drow's response as the escaped prisoners try to flee. The characters can follow Jorlan's suggestion to drop into the webs and then dive into the pool, possibly dealing with a {@creature giant spider} or two and the {@creature gray ooze} along the way. Alternatively, they can look for another way down. Reaching the lift requires getting past the drow clustered on the platform and then attempting to operate it during the attack, which might prove difficult.": "描述恶魔袭击的混乱场面以及逃跑的囚犯试图逃离时乌鸦的反应。角色们可以按照乔兰的建议掉进网里，然后跳进池子里，沿途可能要对付一两个（%0%）和（%1%）。或者，他们也可以寻找另一条路下去。到达升降机需要越过聚集在平台上的乌鸦，然后在攻击期间尝试操作它，这可能会证明是困难的。",
	"If you want to provide an additional challenge for the characters, a {@creature vrock} tumbles almost in front of them as they reach the cavern floor or move toward their chosen exit. The demon is badly wounded, but even with only 11 hit points remaining and having expended its spores and stunning screech abilities, it is still quite dangerous. It screeches at the characters, but if they do nothing to threaten it for 1 round, the demon takes wing and launches itself back into the fight overhead.": "如果你想为角色提供一个额外的挑战，当他们到达洞穴地面或向他们选择的出口移动时，一个（%0%）几乎在他们面前翻滚着。这只恶魔受了重伤，但即使只剩下11点命中率，而且已经用完了它的孢子和令人震惊的尖叫能力，它仍然相当危险。它对着角色尖叫，但如果他们在一回合内没有做任何事情来威胁它，恶魔就会展翅高飞，回到头顶的战斗中。",
	"If the adventurers take on the fallen vrock and defeat or escape from it, award them a quarter of its usual XP value, or 575 XP, given its weakened state.": "如果冒险家们对付堕落的岩浆并击败它或从它手中逃脱，鉴于它的虚弱状态，奖励他们四分之一的通常XP值，或575XP。",
	"If Jorlan is alive when the demons attack, he might use the distraction to free the prisoners (as described in \"Jorlan's Gambit\").

	"The characters have three choices for leaving Velkynvelve: the north, west, and south passages.": "角色们有三种离开Velkynvelve的选择：北部、西部和南部的通道。",
	"This leads toward Menzoberranzan (see {@area chapter 15|4e4|x}) and, eventually, Blingdenstone (see {@adventure chapter 6|OotA|5}).

	"Unless they obtain a supply of food and water, the adventurers must forage to survive on their journey. Finding sustenance in the Underdark is difficult but not impossible. Characters can gather food and water if the party travels at a normal or slow pace. A foraging character makes a Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check.

If the pursuit level reaches 5, the drow forward scouts catch up to them, and the drow leaders arrive not long thereafter (see \"{@area Catching Up|07b|x}\"). If the pursuit level drops to 0, the party has eluded the drow until circumstances bring both factions into contact again (see \"{@area Eluding Pursuit|07c|x}\").": "乌鸦追击的密切程度由追击等级来衡量。它从4级开始，乌鸦在人物后面不远处。如果追击等级达到5，乌鸦的前哨侦察兵就会追上他们，而乌鸦首领也会在不久之后到达（见\"{@area Catching Up|07b|x}\"）。如果追击水平下降到0，那么这支队伍就躲过了乌鸦的追击，直到环境使两派再次接触（见\"{@area Eluding Pursuit|07c|x}\"）。",
	"Characters can increase or decrease the pursuit level in the following ways:": "角色可以通过以下方式提高或降低追求水平。",
	"Decrease the pursuit level by 1 for each day the party travels at a fast pace.": "队伍在快速行进的过程中，每一天减少1个追击等级。",
	"Decrease the pursuit level by 1 if a character spends time covering up the party's trail that day, requiring a successful DC 16 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check.": "如果一个角色在当天花时间掩盖队伍的踪迹，则追击等级降低1，需要成功进行DC 16智慧（（%0%））检查。",
	"Decrease the pursuit level by 1 each time the characters cross or traverse some feature that obscures their trail, such as a subterranean river.": "每次人物穿过或穿越一些掩盖其踪迹的特征时，如地下河，追击等级就会降低1。",
	"Decrease the pursuit level by 1 if the party splits into two or more groups. Each group becomes a separate party for purposes of determining random encounters and whether or not the group becomes lost.": "如果队伍分成两组或更多组，追击等级减少1。在确定随机遭遇和是否迷路时，每组都成为一个单独的队伍。",
	"Increase the pursuit level by 1 each time the party has a random encounter with one or more creatures, unless the encounter is bypassed or avoided entirely.": "每次聚会与一个或多个生物发生随机遭遇时，追击等级增加1，除非该遭遇被绕过或完全避开。",
	"Increase the pursuit level by 1 for each day the adventurers travel at a slow pace.": "冒险者以缓慢的速度旅行，每一天增加1个追击等级。",
	"Certain terrain encounters increase or decrease the pursuit level. See the individual descriptions in the \"Random Encounters\" section.": "某些地形的遭遇会增加或减少追击水平。见 \"随机遭遇 \"部分的个别描述。",
	"The players might come up with additional ways of evading pursuit. Adjudicate these as you see fit. For example, if the characters convince a randomly encountered creature to let them pass by telling them about the wealthy drow following them, you might reduce the pursuit level by 1 as the drow are forced to deal with the encounter before they can resume tracking the party. Similarly, the adventurers could lay traps to slow down their pursuers, or they might convince a friendly creature to lie to the drow about which way the party went.": "队员们可能会想出更多的方法来逃避追捕。按照你认为合适的方式进行裁决。例如，如果角色们说服一个随机遇到的生物让他们通过，告诉他们有一个富有的乌鸦在跟踪他们，你可以将追捕等级降低1，因为乌鸦被迫在继续跟踪队伍之前处理好这次遭遇。同样地，冒险者们可以布置陷阱来减缓追捕者的速度，或者他们可以说服一个友好的生物向乌鸦撒谎，告诉他们队伍走了哪条路。",
	"If you choose to skip over a few days of travel (as described under \"{@area Summarizing Travel|0ac|x}\" later in this chapter), the pursuit level doesn't change during that time.": "如果你选择跳过几天的旅行（如本章后面的\"{@area Summarizing Travel|0ac|x} \"中所述），在这段时间里，追求水平不会改变。",
	"When the pursuit level reaches 5, the drow forward scouts spot the party. At this point, the pursuit might become an encounter if the characters spot the drow and engage them. The characters might try to run, at which point a chase ensues (see \"{@book Chases|DMG|8|Chases}\" in chapter 8 of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}), or they might stand and fight. They might even try to set up some sort of ambush, since the front ranks of the party are likely out of sight of the drow when they first catch up.": "当追击等级达到5级时，乌鸦的前哨侦察兵发现了这支队伍。这时，如果角色们发现了乌鸦并与之交战，追击就可能变成一场遭遇战。角色们可能会试图逃跑，这时就会发生追逐（见《(1%)》第8章的\"{@book Chases|DMG|8|Chases}\"），或者他们可能会站起来战斗。他们甚至可以尝试设下某种埋伏，因为当他们第一次追上乌鸦时，队伍的前排很可能已经离开了他们的视线。",
	"If the adventurers flee and successfully escape, they lower the pursuit level to 4 and begin avoiding their pursuers again. If they fight the drow, run the encounter. The drow scouts focus on maintaining close pursuit and peppering the characters with poisoned hand crossbow bolts. After {@dice 1d6 + 4} rounds, the remainder of the drow party (Ilvara, Asha, Jorlan, and Shoor) catches up and joins the encounter.": "如果冒险者逃跑并成功逃脱，他们会将追击等级降低到4级，并再次开始躲避追兵。如果他们与乌鸦战斗，则进行遭遇战。乌鸦人的侦察兵专注于保持近距离追击，并用带毒的手弩箭攻击角色。在{@dice 1d6 + 4}回合之后，乌鸦队伍的其余成员（伊尔瓦拉、阿莎、乔兰和肖尔）追了上来，加入了这场遭遇战。",
	"If the adventurers lower the pursuit level to 0, the drow lose the trail unless circumstances allow them to locate the characters again. This might include the characters spending a day or more in a place where they are recognized, or where they talk openly about their escape from Velkynvelve. If the characters pass through an area watched over by drow scouts or spies, Ilvara will inevitably hear word of the characters' location. When this occurs, increase the pursuit level to 1 and begin tracking it again as the drow pick up the trail once more.": "如果冒险者将追捕等级降至0，那么乌鸦就会失去踪迹，除非情况允许他们再次找到这些人物。这可能包括人物在一个他们被认出的地方呆上一天或更久，或者他们在那里公开谈论他们从Velkynvelve逃出来的事情。如果这些角色经过了一个由鸦人侦察员或间谍监视的区域，伊尔瓦拉将不可避免地听到这些角色位置的消息。当这种情况发生时，将追捕级别提高到1，并在乌鸦再次拾起线索时再次开始追踪。",
	"If an encounter with the drow is going badly and you don't want the characters recaptured, you can always have fate intercede on their behalf with another encounter or event offering a distraction.": "如果与乌鸦的遭遇很糟糕，而你又不想让角色被抓回来，你可以让命运替他们出面，用另一个遭遇或事件来转移他们的注意力。",
	"For example, a wandering stone giant, a purple worm, or a pack of savage gnolls whipped into a frenzy by Yeenoghu might show up just as the drow have the characters cornered, giving them a chance to run. Likewise, a minor earthquake (caused by instability from the demonic incursion or a wild magic surge) might cause a cave-in, cutting off a tunnel between the party and their pursuers, and dropping the pursuit level by 1 or 2.": "例如，一个游荡的石巨人、一只紫色的虫子，或者一群被耶诺古激怒的野蛮地精，可能会在乌鸦把角色逼到角落时出现，给他们一个逃跑的机会。同样地，一场小地震（由恶魔入侵的不稳定性或狂野的魔法涌动引起）可能会导致洞穴坍塌，切断队伍与追兵之间的通道，并使追击等级下降1或2。",
	"Don't do this so often that the players feel they haven't earned it, but use it as an option to keep the pursuit going rather than coming to an anticlimactic conclusion.": "不要经常这样做，以至于玩家觉得他们没有赚到钱，但要把它作为一个选项，让追击的过程继续下去，而不是以一种反常的方式结束。",
	"The drow try to capture the escaped prisoners if at all possible, since Ilvara wants the pleasure of teaching them a lesson about disobedience. If the dark elves reduce any characters to 0 hit points, those characters are knocked out rather than dying (see \"{@book Knocking a Creature Out|PHB|9|Knocking a Creature Out}\" in chapter 9 of the {@i Player's Handbook}). Even if one or more of the characters are accidentally killed, Ilvara is obsessed enough to cast {@spell raise dead} to restore them to life (assuming the character's soul is willing to return).": "如果可能的话，乌鸦人试图抓住逃跑的囚犯，因为伊尔瓦拉希望能愉快地给他们一个关于不服从的教训。如果黑暗精灵将任何角色的命中率降至0，这些角色就会被击倒而不是死亡（见《{@book Knocking a Creature Out|PHB|9|Knocking a Creature Out}》第九章的\"{@i Player's Handbook}\"）。即使一个或多个角色被意外杀死，伊尔瓦拉也会执着地施展（%%2%）来恢复他们的生命（假设该角色的灵魂愿意回归）。",
	"Captured characters are disarmed, their hands bound with spider-silk rope, and gagged. The drow march them back to Velkynvelve unless Menzoberranzan is closer, in which case Ilvara takes them there instead. The characters will need to come up with a new plan of escape, ideally before Ilvara has the opportunity to torture them or sell them into slavery in the City of Spiders. If they escape her clutches again, the drow priestess continues her pursuit until she is dead or the party leaves the Underdark (see {@adventure chapter 7|OotA|6}).": "被俘的人物被解除武装，双手被蜘蛛丝绳绑住，并被塞住嘴。鸦人将他们押送回维尔基维尔，除非门索伯兰山更近，在这种情况下，伊尔瓦拉将他们带到那里。角色们需要想出一个新的逃跑计划，最好是在伊尔瓦拉有机会折磨他们或把他们卖到蜘蛛之城为奴之前。如果他们再次逃出她的魔掌，鸦人女祭司就会继续追捕他们，直到她死了或者队伍离开暗黑世界（见（%0%））。",
	"Each day of travel through the Underdark, check twice to see if the characters encounter anything unusual: once while they are traveling, and again while they are camped or resting.

	"Since there is no wind in the Underdark, all water travel involves either rowing at 1½ miles per hour, or floating with prevailing currents at 1 mile per hour. Characters can work in shifts to row more than 8 hours per day, but crewing a boat for longer than that is considered a forced march (see {@book chapter 8|PHB|8|Travel Pace} of the {@i Player's Handbook}).": "由于暗黑世界没有风，所有的水上旅行都是以每小时1.5英里的速度划船，或者以每小时1英里的速度随水流漂浮。角色可以轮流工作，每天划船超过8小时，但划船时间超过8小时则被视为强制行军（见{@i Player's Handbook}的{@book chapter 8|PHB|8|Travel Pace}）。",

Some are completely submerged, navigable only by those able to breathe underwater.": "黑暗湖是由湖泊、水路和运河组成的巨大迷宫，连接着无数的洞穴和房间。其中一些洞穴非常巨大，水深不可估量，拱形的天花板远远超出任何光线的范围。另一些则很狭窄，天花板和水面之间只有几英尺的空间。有些则完全被淹没，只有能够在水下呼吸的人才能航行。",
	"Without the sky or the stars to navigate by, any successful passage of the Darklake relies on one's familiarity with its intricate network of caverns, passages, and currents.

Such knowledge is something that takes years, if not decades, of wandering the Darklake to acquire.Those without the skill to navigate the Darklake (including the adventurers) must employ maps or guides.

Ploopploopeen wants the characters to disrupt the upstart faction's rituals, allowing his true believers of the Sea Mother to cut off the head of the cult. The archpriest promises that the characters will be \"well rewarded\" for their aid.": "海之母的大神官告诉这些人物，他想用他们作为诱饵。深海之父的大神官需要人形的祭品，而这一行人在这方面代表了一个奖品的收集。Ploopploopeen将把这些角色作为 \"和平与和解的信物\"，以接近深海之父的大祭司--只不过冒险者们将不是无助的囚犯，而是渗透者。Ploopploopeen希望角色们能破坏新晋派别的仪式，让他的海之母的真正信徒砍掉邪教的头。大祭司承诺，这些人物将因为他们的帮助而得到 \"丰厚的回报\"。",

	"It might well be that the kuo-toa's former masters—the mind flayers—used them as ferry pilots and navigators in the Underdark, and the fish-folk continue to do so out of habit or some deep-seated need. Certainly, their relative usefulness to the other races of the Underdark has served the kuo-toa well. Only the duergar have shown any interest in navigating the waters of the Darklake on their own, and not even they do it as well as the kuo-toa.": "很可能是Kuo-toa以前的主人--心灵传播者--把它们作为暗黑世界的渡轮驾驶员和导航员，而鱼人继续这样做是出于习惯或某种根深蒂固的需要。当然，他们对暗黑世界其他种族的相对有用性对Kuo-toa很有帮助。只有杜尔加人对自己在暗黑湖的水域中航行表现出任何兴趣，甚至他们也没有像国土人那样做得好。",
	"There is a persistent myth among the inhabitants of Sloobludop that the maze of tunnels, passages, and pools of the Darklake is a kind of meditation—a spiritual journey.

	"{@creature Buppido|OotA} (see {@area chapter 1|008|x}) and Hemeth (see {@area chapter 3|12a|x}) are the only NPCs who actively suggest going to Gracklstugh. They know that duergar have no love for the drow, and their draconian laws keep all foreigners in check, which should provide some measure of sanctuary from drow pursuit. Gracklstugh is as good a place as any in the Underdark to sell stolen gear and buy more useful equipment. Additionally, the duergar trade actively with other subterranean and surface-dwelling races. Gracklstugh's Blade Bazaar might be the ideal place to find traders or explorers heading to the surface world.": "{@creature Buppido|OotA}（见{@area chapter 1|008|x}）和Hemeth（见{@area chapter 3|12a|x}）是唯一积极建议去Gracklstugh的NPC。他们知道杜尔加人对乌鸦没有好感，他们的严酷法律控制着所有的外国人，这应该能提供某种程度的避难所，让他们免受乌鸦的追捕。Gracklstugh是暗黑世界中最适合出售偷来的装备和购买更多有用装备的地方。此外，杜尔加人还积极地与其他地下和地面居住的种族进行贸易。格拉克斯图的刀锋集市可能是寻找前往地表世界的商人或探险家的理想场所。",
	"If {@creature Buppido|OotA} or Hemeth isn't with the party, others can provide the above information. Sarith resists plans to travel to the city at first, conscious of the low regard the duergar have for drow. He changes his mind quickly, however, as Zuggtmoy's spores drive him to seek a densely populated area where he can spread his contagion.": "如果{@creature Buppido|OotA}或Hemeth不在队伍中，其他人可以提供上述信息。Sarith起初抵制前往城市的计划，因为他意识到杜尔加人对乌鸦的轻视。然而，他很快就改变了主意，因为祖格莫伊的孢子促使他寻找一个人口稠密的地区，在那里他可以传播他的传染病。",
	"It's also possible the party arrives at Gracklstugh involuntarily. Duergar slavers scour the Underdark in search of new \"merchandise,\" and they might deceive or outright capture the characters and bring them to their city's slave markets. The random encounters in chapters 2 and 3 can easily set up this scenario.": "他们也有可能不由自主地来到了格拉克尔斯图。Duergar奴隶主在暗黑世界中寻找新的 \"商品\"，他们可能会欺骗或直接捕获角色，并将他们带到他们城市的奴隶市场。第2章和第3章中的随机遭遇可以很容易地设置这个场景。",
	"Taking refuge in Gracklstugh has its advantages. Each day they spend in the duergar capital, the characters can attempt a DC 16 group Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check to move around cautiously, with success indicating that they avoid drawing attention to themselves. The characters can also attempt a DC 13 group Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check to assess the mood in the city, with success allowing them to avoid trouble before it starts. Characters who lie low for the day have advantage on this Wisdom check.": "在Gracklstugh避难有其好处。在duergar首都度过的每一天，人物都可以尝试用DC16的团体灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）检查来谨慎行动，成功后表明他们可以避免引起注意。角色还可以尝试DC13的群体智慧（{@skill Insight}）检查来评估城市的情绪，成功后可以在麻烦开始之前避免麻烦。躺在地上一天的人物在这个智慧检查上有优势。",
	"Success with either check reduces the party's pursuit level by 1 (see \"{@area Drow Pursuit|078|x}\" in chapter 2).": "任何一项检查的成功都会使本方的追击等级降低1（见第2章的\"（%0%）\"）。",
	"The Darklake District is a likely entry point to the city for the characters, whether they arrive via the water or travel one of the many tunnels leading to the district's gates. Non-duergar arriving from tunnels that lead to other districts are stopped and escorted to the Darklake District under heavy guard, as every other district is normally off limits to outsiders, and trespassers risk being confronted by an {@condition invisible} patrol of four duergar.": "黑暗湖区是人物进入城市的一个可能的入口，无论他们是通过水路还是通过通往该区大门的许多隧道到达。从通往其他地区的隧道到达的非龙人被拦住，并在严密的警卫下被护送到暗湖区，因为其他地区通常是禁止外人进入的，闯入者有可能被四名龙人组成的（%0%）巡逻队撞见。",
	"The party's fellow escapees know that trying to enter through the main entrances is a sure way to get enslaved, unless one of the characters is an epic liar who can convince the guards the party is a legitimate diplomatic or trade delegation. Anyone with a merchant or criminal background has heard rumors that the Zhentarim trade in the Underdark, but posing as Zhentarim has its own risks, as such claims are bound to be questioned. A character who is actually a member of the Zhentarim can buy the adventurers a couple of days inside the city before the duergar slavers start taking their measure.": "队伍的同伴们知道，试图从主要入口进入肯定会被奴役，除非其中一个角色是个史诗般的骗子，能让守卫相信队伍是一个合法的外交或贸易代表团。任何有商人或犯罪背景的人都听说过赞塔林在暗黑世界进行贸易的传闻，但冒充赞塔林也有其风险，因为这种说法必然会受到质疑。一个真正是赞塔林成员的角色可以为冒险者争取到几天的时间，在杜尔加奴隶主开始打量他们之前，他们可以在城内停留几天。",
	"Arriving by way of the Darklake Docks is easier and more discreet. If the characters are traveling by boat, {@creature Buppido|OotA} can guide them to a deserted pier where they can dock quietly. He warns them that they have to keep a low profile and head directly to the only inn in the city devoted to outsiders. The Ghohlbrorn's Lair is frequented by merchants, mercenaries, and other foreigners who can offer information about traveling elsewhere in the Underdark—or perhaps even to the surface world.": "通过暗湖码头到达更容易，也更隐蔽。如果人物是乘船旅行，{@creature Buppido|OotA}可以引导他们到一个废弃的码头，在那里他们可以安静地停靠。他警告他们必须保持低调，并直接前往城市中唯一专门为外来者服务的旅馆。Ghohlbrorn's Lair是商人、雇佣兵和其他外国人经常光顾的地方，他们可以提供有关在暗黑世界其他地方旅行的信息，甚至可能是到地面世界的信息。",
	"Sweltering heat and cloying smoke cling to every corner of the duergar city, spewing from smelters housed inside massive stalagmites and stalactites. These protrude from the cavern's floor and ceiling like the teeth of some great maw.": "闷热的天气和令人窒息的烟雾笼罩着杜尔加城市的每一个角落，从装在巨大的石笋和钟乳石里的冶炼厂喷出。这些石笋和钟乳石从洞穴的地板和天花板上伸出来，就像一些大嘴的牙齿。",
	"Gracklstugh's glowing forges and smithies operate continuously. Most of the city is dimly lit by a hellish red glow, with patches of darkness here and there.": "Gracklstugh的发光锻造厂和铁匠铺持续运作。城市的大部分地区都被地狱般的红光照亮，这里和那里都有一些黑暗的斑点。",
	"The clanging and clacking of hammers and machinery echoes constantly throughout the city. Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks made to listen in Gracklstugh have disadvantage.": "锤子和机器的叮叮当当声在整个城市不断回响。在Gracklstugh进行的智慧({@skill Perception})检查对倾听是不利的。",
	"Despite vents dug into the walls and ceiling of the city's great cavern, fumes from smelters and forges linger at ground level (as does the gas tapped in Laduguer's Furrow). Visitors might contract the illness known as grackle-lung (see the Grackle-lung sidebar).": "尽管在城市大洞穴的墙壁和天花板上挖有通风口，但冶炼厂和锻造厂的烟气仍在地面上徘徊（就像在拉杜古尔沟挖掘的气体一样）。游客可能会感染被称为鹩哥肺的疾病（见 \"鹩哥肺 \"边栏）。",
	"With routine patrols of heavily armed gray dwarves who can turn {@condition invisible}, Gracklstugh is a relatively safe place for those who know where they belong and stay there. However, tensions are rising because of the influence of Demogorgon, and the characters have many opportunities to participate in events unfolding in the city. At the end of each long rest, roll a {@dice d20}; on a roll of 17–20, an encounter takes place.

	"Wary outsiders visiting Gracklstugh quickly learn the most important details of life in the city.": "警惕的外来者在访问格拉克斯图的时候，很快就了解到了城市生活中最重要的细节。",
	"The duergar power of invisibility plays a significant role in their society. The potential presence of unseen spies everywhere enforces honesty among duergar. Slaves rarely, if ever, talk or act against their masters, never knowing who might be watching.": "杜尔加人的隐形能力在他们的社会中起着重要作用。到处都有看不见的间谍的潜在存在，这使得杜尔加人的诚实性得到加强。奴隶们很少（如果有的话）谈论或采取行动反对他们的主人，因为他们从不知道谁可能在监视。",
	"Not only is the layout of Gracklstugh divided, so are its people. Nearly five hundred years ago, the derro launched a Uniting War against the Deepkingdom, but were swiftly crushed, and the survivors brought back to Gracklstugh in chains. Though their status as slaves was eventually set aside, the derro have always been second-class citizens, living in squalor and scrounging food and resources, even as their leaders on the Council of Savants live in secret opulence.": "不仅Gracklstugh的布局是分裂的，其人民也是如此。近五百年前，德鲁人发起了一场针对深海王国的联合战争，但被迅速击溃，幸存者被锁链带回了格拉克尔斯特。虽然他们的奴隶身份最终被搁置，但德鲁人一直是二等公民，生活在肮脏的环境中，四处搜刮食物和资源，即使他们在救世主议会中的领导人也生活在秘密的富足之中。",
	"The gray dwarves value efficiency, stoicism, and hard work, and these values are exemplified in their capital. Everything the duergar make or build has a purpose and function; the only aesthetic they value in architecture is imposing vastness, and even that is secondary to a building's structural function. The only ornamentations found in Gracklstugh are iconic representations of rank and function within duergar society, and the only music is the ceaseless rhythmic hammering in the forges. The duergar consider art a frivolous pursuit, and only rarely appreciate or create it.": "灰矮人重视效率、坚忍和努力工作，这些价值观在他们的资本中得到了体现。灰矮人制造或建造的所有东西都有其目的和功能；他们在建筑方面唯一重视的美学就是宏伟的规模，即使这也是次要的，因为建筑的结构功能。在Gracklstugh发现的唯一的装饰品是二重奏社会中等级和功能的标志性代表，唯一的音乐是锻造厂里无休止的有节奏的敲击声。duergar人认为艺术是一种轻浮的追求，而且很少欣赏或创造它。",
	"The lairds and merchants who sit at this council make sure that trade and commerce flow smoothly. They employ slave labor to maintain trade routes in the dangerous Underdark, and are always open to hiring explorers to check out leads on potential new routes. Expendable outsiders hired as caravan guards always take point and receive little aid or support from the caravan masters. Despite these unfair assignments, the duergar always live up to their bargains, paying survivors as promised.": "坐在议会里的领主和商人们确保贸易和商业的顺利进行。他们雇佣奴隶来维护危险的暗黑世界的贸易路线，并且总是愿意雇佣探险家来检查潜在的新路线的线索。被雇为商队守卫的消耗品的外来者总是拿着点，很少得到商队主人的援助或支持。尽管有这些不公平的任务，杜尔加人总是履行他们的协议，按照承诺支付幸存者。",
	"In addition to the clans' regular armies, Gracklstugh trains specialized warriors whose oaths of service always supersede their original loyalties. See {@adventure appendix C|OotA|19} for more information.": "除了部族的正规军，格拉克尔斯特还训练专门的战士，他们的服役誓言总是取代他们原来的忠诚。更多信息见{@adventure appendix C|OotA|19}。",

	"Despite reports that the darkhafts and the Stone Guards have received about the growing crisis outside the city's walls, hubris and the onset of madness prevents them from mounting any sort of response or campaign, blind to the corruption that festers around them.": "尽管暗堡和石卫收到了关于城墙外日益严重的危机的报告，但傲慢和疯狂的出现使他们无法采取任何形式的回应或行动，对他们周围发酵的腐败视而不见。",
	"The constant smog in Gracklstugh causes grackle-lung in living, breathing creatures, resulting in persistent, wracking coughs and the spewing of thick, black phlegm. Whenever a living, breathing creature finishes a long rest in Gracklstugh, it must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On each failed save, the creature gains one level of {@condition exhaustion} as its airways become increasingly clogged. A creature that reaches level 6 {@condition exhaustion} dies, as normal.": "在Gracklstugh的持续烟雾会导致生物的grackle-lung，导致持续的、痛苦的咳嗽和喷出浓厚的、黑色的痰液。每当一个会呼吸的生物在Gracklstugh中完成长时间的休息时，它必须做一个DC11的宪法救赎动作。在每一次失败的救赎中，该生物都会增加一个等级的（%0%），因为它的呼吸道变得越来越堵塞。达到6级{@condition exhaustion}的生物会死亡，如常。",
	"A creature with one or more levels of {@condition exhaustion} brought on by grackle-lung must succeed on a Constitution check to take the {@action Dash} action. If the check fails, the action cannot be attempted. If the creature attempts to cast a spell with a verbal component, it must succeed on a Constitution check or be unable to complete the spell, causing the spell to fail with no effect. The DC for each check is 10 + the creature's current {@condition exhaustion} level.": "一个被格拉克龙带来的{@condition exhaustion}等级的生物必须在宪法检查中成功，才能采取{@action Dash}的行动。如果检定失败，则不能尝试该行动。如果该生物试图施放一个有语言成分的咒语，它必须在体质检查中成功，否则无法完成咒语，导致咒语失败，没有效果。每次检定的DC是10+该生物当前的{@condition exhaustion}等级。",
	"If a creature's {@condition exhaustion} level drops below 1, it no longer suffers the effects of grackle-lung and becomes immune to it for the next week. Duergar and derro are inured to grackle-lung, making Constitution checks against it with advantage. Any spell or effect that cures disease also cures grackle-lung, effectively removing all levels of {@condition exhaustion} brought on by the affliction.": "如果一个生物的{@condition exhaustion}等级下降到1以下，它就不再受到grackle-lung的影响，并在下一周内对它免疫。Duergar和derro对grackle-lung有免疫力，对它进行体质检查时有优势。任何能治疗疾病的法术或效果也能治疗格拉克勒之肺，有效地消除该病症带来的所有级别的（%1%）。",
	"The stone giants of Clan Cairngorm lead quiet lives of art and contemplation in Gracklstugh. Although reclusive and averse to conflict, the giants have sworn an ancient oath of loyalty to the Deepking, and have been serving his line for as long as any can remember. This oath, however, was given only to the Steelshadow clan. If the throne passes to another dynasty, the stone giants will cease to be the city's allies.": "凯恩戈姆氏族的石头巨人在格雷克尔斯图过着安静的艺术和沉思的生活。虽然隐居并不喜欢冲突，但这些巨人对深王发下了古老的忠诚誓言，并且从人们有记忆以来就一直为他的家族服务。然而，这个誓言只给了钢影氏族。如果王位传给另一个王朝，石巨人将不再是城市的盟友。",
	"The leader of the stone giants is Stonespeaker Hgraam, a priest of Skoraeus Stonebones, the god of his people. Hgraam is wise and knowledgeable. He has sensed that some great evil has broken into the Underdark, but isn't aware of the threat's danger or extent. The giants will rise to defend Gracklstugh if any demons dare to invade, but they are unaware of the danger creeping into the city from within.": "石巨人的领袖是讲石人赫格莱姆（Stonespeaker Hgraam），他是他的族人之神斯科雷欧-石骨的祭司。Hgraam是个聪明的人，知识渊博。他感觉到一些巨大的邪恶已经闯入了地下世界，但并不清楚威胁的危险性和程度。如果有恶魔敢于入侵，巨人们会奋起保卫格拉克斯图，但他们不知道危险正从城市内部悄悄进入。",

	"This {@creature adult red dragon} keeps the city's smelters and forges ablaze, receiving treasure, free meals, and constant pampering in exchange. {@creature Themberchaud|OotA} doesn't know that, like other Wyrmsmiths before him, he is doomed to be slain before he grows too strong, replaced by a new red hatchling. However, the line of succession was interrupted when the Gray Ghosts stole a red dragon egg from the Keepers of the Flame.": "这个{@creature adult red dragon}让城市的冶炼厂和锻造厂火力全开，接受宝藏、免费的饮食和不断的宠爱作为交换。{@creature Themberchaud|OotA}不知道，像他之前的其他巫师一样，他注定要在成长得太强之前被杀死，被新的红色孵化器取代。然而，当灰鬼从火焰守护者那里偷了一颗红龙蛋时，继承的路线被打断了。",
	"The Wyrmsmith is beginning to chafe under the Keepers' control. He now wonders why he is content with a mere trickle of gold and a paltry handful of slaves, when he could simply force the entire city to bend knee to him and give him everything he desires. For now, his actions are limited by how little he cares about the duergar and how much the Keepers speak \"on his behalf.\" But he has begun taking an interest in the affairs of Gracklstugh and the opportunity to recruit new servants from outside the Keepers of the Flame, using his outings to rekindle forges and smelters as a means to keep an eye out for promising subjects.": "在守护者的控制下，巫师开始感到不安。他现在想知道为什么他只满足于涓涓细流的黄金和一小撮奴隶，而他可以简单地迫使整个城市向他屈膝，给他想要的一切。目前，他的行动受到了限制，因为他对杜尔加的关心程度很低，而且守卫者们 \"代表他 \"说话。但他已经开始对格拉克尔斯图的事务和从火焰守护者之外招募新仆人的机会感兴趣，利用他外出重燃锻造厂和冶炼厂的机会，留意有前途的对象。",

	"The Keepers of the Flame caught and executed the Gray Ghosts' previous leader, who stole their red dragon egg but never revealed its whereabouts.

	"The {@i Forak-Erach-Naek} (\"Empty-Scabbard Killers\" in Common) are a folktale in Gracklstugh, their name derived from an ancient, obscure Dwarvish dialect.

More than a myth, these killers have been plying their trade for centuries, their motives unknown and their methods inscrutable.": "{@i Forak-Erach-Naek} (\"Empty-Scabbard Killers\" in Common)是Gracklstugh的一个民间故事，他们的名字来自一种古老而晦涩的矮人方言。他们是一个幻术刺客组织，练习的是连最精明的德鲁人或最聪明的牧师都不知道的学科。这不仅仅是一个神话，这些杀手已经从事他们的工作几个世纪了，他们的动机不明，他们的方法难以捉摸。",
	"The Empty-Scabbard Killers are {@creature Duergar Soulblade|MTF|duergar soulblades} (see {@adventure appendix C|OotA|19}) who roam the streets of Gracklstugh searching for psionically gifted children to abduct and train.

	"The duergar are called gray dwarves not only because of the color of their skin, but also because of their drab and joyless lifestyle. While they make no time for merriment, the duergar have a culture as rich and complex as any other, and nowhere is this so evident as in Gracklstugh.": "杜尔加人被称为灰矮人，不仅是因为他们的皮肤颜色，而且还因为他们单调和无趣的生活方式。虽然他们没有时间欢乐，但杜尔加人的文化和其他任何人一样丰富和复杂，这一点在格拉克斯图格最明显不过了。",

They are merciless masters to the derro and slaves who toil and suffer under them.": "在刀锋之城，工作从未停止，灰矮人以效率和完美为荣，即使他们憎恶浪费和粗心。对于在他们手下劳作和受苦的德鲁人和奴隶，他们是无情的主人。",
	"By appearance and bearing, all duergar know their place and where they belong. Whether as individuals, families, or entire clans, duergar below other duergar in the social order don't seek to bring their rivals down through intrigue and deceit. Rather, they roll up their sleeves and work harder to increase their prestige through the fruits of their labor.": "从外表和气质上看，所有的龙骑兵都知道自己的位置和归属。无论是作为个人、家庭还是整个家族，在社会秩序中地位低于其他二人组的二人组并不寻求通过阴谋和欺骗打倒对手。相反，他们卷起袖子，更加努力地工作，通过他们的劳动成果提高自己的威望。",

	"Duergar clans use caverns under Gracklstugh and choice outlying caves to farm a variety of plants and fungi. These crops are complemented by meat from Underdark beasts and fish from the Darklake.

	"The bottom rung in Gracklstugh society is mostly occupied by the underclass of the derro. Enslaved by the duergar centuries ago, then freed, the derro aren't allowed to hold honest jobs, and their rights are hardly ever recognized by the duergar. Even slaves are held in higher regard. Derro scuttle about like vermin and are mostly confined to hovels built along the walls of Laduguer's Furrow in the West Cleft District and East Cleft District.": "在Gracklstugh社会的最底层，大部分被底层的德鲁人所占据。几个世纪前，德鲁人被杜尔加人奴役，然后被释放，德鲁人不被允许从事诚实的工作，他们的权利也几乎不被杜尔加人承认。即使是奴隶也被看得很重。德罗人像害虫一样四处游荡，大多被限制在西裂谷区和东裂谷区沿着拉杜古尔之墙建造的小屋里。",
	"Another kind of outcasts are those duergar who dishonor their clans so grievously they are stripped of all but their lives: the {@i calassabrak}, meaning \"the flawed who aren't to be trusted\" in Dwarvish. They are shunned by other duergar, many eventually taking their lives rather than face an existence apart from family and clan. Those who live on become bitter and tough, with many leaving Gracklstugh as hermits or adventurers, or turning to crime and a life in the shadows. Members of both the Gray Ghosts and the Empty-Scabbard Killers include a significant number of calassabrak, no longer bound by oath, honor, and duty.": "另一种被遗弃的人是那些严重玷污了自己家族的人，他们被剥夺了所有的东西，除了他们的生命：{@i calassabrak}，在矮人语中的意思是 \"不值得信任的瑕疵者\"。他们被其他矮人回避，许多人最终宁可牺牲自己的生命也不愿面对与家人和家族分离的生活。那些活着的人变得痛苦而强硬，许多人离开格拉克斯图成为隐士或冒险家，或者转向犯罪和阴影中的生活。灰色幽灵和空鞘杀手的成员包括大量的卡拉萨布拉克人，他们不再受誓言、荣誉和责任的约束。",

	"A splinter group of the Council of Savants began worshiping Demogorgon even before the current crisis, and their foul rituals accelerated the spread of madness in the city.

The derro cultists plan to offer the entire city to their newly arrived master.": "救世主委员会的一个分裂团体甚至在当前的危机之前就开始崇拜德摩根，他们的肮脏仪式加速了城市中疯狂的蔓延。更糟糕的是，这个城市的分裂性质，无论是地理上还是社会上，都与德摩根的双重性产生了强烈的共鸣。德罗邪教徒计划将整个城市献给他们新来的主人。",

	"Minor crime is relatively rare in Gracklstugh. The duergar live by a strict code of honor, and their laws are few, simple, and practical. Both guards and regular citizens can be {@condition invisible} and watching, which keeps any potential criminals and dissenters uncertain and fearful. A laird may punish any member of his or her clan who commits a crime, but offenses between clans are immediately brought before the Council of Lairds, which resolves matters swiftly and harshly. The code of punishment is simple. Because dishonor, mutilation and imprisonment are a waste of resources and create weakness in society, a duergar who intentionally commits any crime receives a death sentence. Accidental crime by a duergar is compensated by goods or work equivalent to the damages. Derro, slaves or outsiders caught committing any crime can be executed on the spot by any duergar present.": "轻微犯罪在格拉克尔斯图相对罕见。杜尔加人奉行严格的荣誉准则，他们的法律很少，很简单，很实用。守卫和普通公民都可以{@condition invisible}和监视，这让任何潜在的罪犯和异议者感到不确定和恐惧。一个领主可以惩罚他或她的部族中任何犯罪的成员，但部族之间的犯罪行为会立即被提交给领主委员会，该委员会会迅速而严厉地解决问题。惩罚的准则很简单。因为羞辱、残害和监禁是对资源的浪费，并会造成社会的软弱，所以故意犯下任何罪行的duergar会被判处死刑。杜尔加人的意外犯罪将得到与损失相当的物品或工作的补偿。犯有任何罪行的德鲁人、奴隶或外人被抓获后，可由在场的任何一个杜尔加人当场处决。",
