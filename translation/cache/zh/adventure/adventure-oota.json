	"Deep beneath the surface of the world lies the Underdark, a realm of endless labyrinthine tunnels and caverns where the sun never shines. The Underdark is filled with races and creatures too numerous to count or list, and foremost among these are the dark elves—the drow. Hated and feared even by their fellow dwellers in darkness, the drow raid other settlements in the Underdark as well as the surface world, taking prisoners back with them. Rendered {@condition unconscious} with drow poison, then collared and shackled, these prisoners are eventually sold as slaves or entertainment in the dark elves' subterranean cities.": "在世界表面之下的深处是暗黑世界，一个由无尽的迷宫般的隧道和洞穴组成的领域，太阳从不照耀。黑暗世界充满了众多的种族和生物，数也数不清，其中最重要的是黑暗精灵--乌鸦。乌鸦甚至被他们在黑暗中的同伴所憎恨和恐惧，他们袭击了暗黑世界的其他定居点以及表面世界，并将囚犯带回去。这些囚犯被施以鸦人的毒药，然后被戴上项圈和镣铐，最终被卖到黑暗精灵的地下城市作为奴隶或娱乐。",
	"The adventurers have all had the misfortune of falling to such a fate. Captured by the drow, they are prisoners at one of the dark elves' outposts, awaiting transportation to Menzoberranzan, the City of Spiders. Whether they came into the Underdark seeking knowledge or fortune, or were just in the wrong place at the wrong time, they were ripe prey for a drow raid.": "冒险家们都曾不幸落入这样的命运。他们被乌鸦俘虏，在黑暗精灵的某个前哨站成为囚犯，等待被送往蜘蛛之城门索布兰赞。无论他们是来暗黑世界寻求知识或财富，还是在错误的时间出现在错误的地点，他们都是乌鸦突袭的成熟猎物。",
	"The setup of {@i Out of the Abyss} is such that the characters need have no connections with events in the Underdark, or with each other, prior to the start of the adventure. They can meet and get to know each other as prisoners of the drow. Players who would like their characters to have a stronger Underdark connection can choose from the background options in {@adventure appendix A|OotA|17}.": "{@i Out of the Abyss}的设置是这样的：在冒险开始之前，人物不需要与暗黑世界的事件或彼此之间有任何联系。他们可以作为乌鸦的俘虏来认识和了解对方。如果玩家希望他们的角色与暗黑世界有更强的联系，可以从{@adventure appendix A|OotA|17}的背景选项中选择。",
	"\"Prisoners of the Drow\" assumes the characters start at 1st level, and that they will achieve 2nd level (if not 3rd) by the end of this chapter of the adventure. Given the challenges of the adventure and the dangers of the Underdark, you can start the characters at a higher level (2nd or 3rd) to make things a bit easier for the players.": "\"乌鸦的囚徒 \"假设角色从1级开始，在冒险的这一章结束时他们将达到2级（如果不是3级）。考虑到冒险的挑战和地下城的危险，你可以让角色从更高的等级开始（2级或3级），让玩家更容易一些。",
	"The characters' goal in this chapter of the adventure is straightforward: escape from the drow outpost of Velkynvelve, with an eye toward escaping from the Underdark. However, this goal is complicated by the adventurers' lack of familiarity with their surroundings. Even if the prisoners can get away from the drow, where will they go and how will they survive?": "在这一章的冒险中，人物的目标很直接：从维尔基维尔的乌鸦前哨逃出，并着眼于逃离暗黑世界。然而，由于冒险者们对周围环境的不熟悉，这个目标变得很复杂。即使囚犯们能够摆脱乌鸦，他们将去哪里，如何生存？",
	"All the drow's prisoners, including the characters, wear iron slave collars along with manacles connected to iron belts by a short length of chain. This leaves the prisoners {@condition restrained}, but doesn't affect their movement or speed.": "所有乌鸦的囚犯，包括人物在内，都戴着铁制的奴隶项圈，以及用短链连接到铁质腰带的手铐。这让囚犯们（%0%），但并不影响他们的行动和速度。",
	"In addition to being manacled, spellcasters don't have any spell components or focuses, initially limiting their spellcasting ability. (Wizard characters don't need their spellbooks to cast spells, but will be unable to change their prepared spells without them. As such, give wizard characters some leeway in determining which spells they had previously prepared before being captured.) Moreover, spellcasting isn't possible inside the slave pen because of its magical wards (see area 11).": "除了被戴上手铐外，施法者没有任何法术组件或焦点，最初限制了他们的施法能力。(巫师角色不需要他们的法术书来施法，但没有法术书将无法改变他们准备的法术）。因此，在确定他们在被俘之前准备了哪些法术时，要给巫师角色一些余地）。此外，由于奴隶营内有魔法屏障，所以施法是不可能的（见区域11）。",
	"Slipping out of manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check, while breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. A character can unlock the manacles using thieves' tools with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. The manacles have 15 hit points. The iron collars can be broken with a successful DC 20 Strength check. The collars have 12 hit points. A character who fails a check to break a collar, break a set of manacles, or escape from a set of manacles can't attempt checks of that kind again until he or she finishes a long rest. A character can still use the {@action Help} action to aid another character, however.": "溜出手铐需要成功地进行DC20灵巧检查，而打破手铐则需要成功地进行DC20力量检查。一个角色可以用盗贼的工具解开手铐，但需要成功地进行DC 15的灵巧检查。手铐有15个打击点。铁领子可以通过成功的DC20力量检查来打破。项圈有12点生命值。一个角色如果在挣脱项圈、挣脱一套手铐或从一套手铐中逃脱的检查中失败，在他或她完成长时间的休息之前，不能再尝试此类检查。然而，一个角色仍然可以使用{@action Help}动作来帮助另一个角色。",
	"The characters begin the adventure in the slave pens of Velkynvelve. Stripped of everything but their underclothing, they are at the mercy of the dark elves and in the company of other prisoners, many of who aren't what they seem.": "角色们在Velkynvelve的奴隶牢房里开始冒险。他们被剥夺了所有的东西，只剩下内衣，任由黑暗精灵摆布，与其他囚犯为伍，其中许多人并不像他们看起来那样。",
	"Captured by the drow! You wouldn't wish this fate upon anyone, yet here you are—locked in a dark cave, the cold, heavy weight of metal tight around your throat and wrists. You are not alone. Other prisoners are trapped in here with you, in an underground outpost far from the light of the sun. Your captors include a cruel drow priestess who calls herself Mistress Ilvara of House Mizzrym. Over the past several days, you've met her several times, robed in silken garments and flanked by two male drow, one of whom has a mass of scars along one side of his face and neck. Mistress Ilvara likes to impress her will with scourge in hand and remind you that your life now belongs to her. \"Accept your fate, learn to obey, and you may survive.\" Her words echo in your memory, even as you plot your escape.": "被乌鸦抓走了！你不希望任何人遭受这种命运。你不希望任何人遭受这种命运，但你现在却被锁在一个黑暗的山洞里，冰冷、沉重的金属紧紧箍住你的喉咙和手腕。你并不孤单。其他囚犯和你一起被困在这里，在一个远离阳光的地下哨所。俘虏你的人包括一个残酷的鸦人女祭司，她自称是米兹林家族的伊尔瓦拉女主人。在过去的几天里，你见过她好几次，她身穿丝质服装，身旁有两个男性乌鸦，其中一个的脸部和脖子一侧有大量的伤疤。女主人伊尔瓦拉喜欢用手中的鞭子打动她的意志，并提醒你，你的生命现在属于她了。\"接受你的命运，学会服从，你就可能活下来。\" 她的话在你的记忆中回响，甚至在你策划逃跑的时候。",
	"Assume that each player character has been a prisoner in Velkynvelve for {@dice 1d10} days. (Roll separately for each character.)

	"Feel free to play out any interaction between the drow, the player characters, and the other prisoners. This is an opportunity to reveal who the characters are and to flesh out their backgrounds and personalities through roleplaying, even as you introduce some of their fellow prisoners. Ilvara's newest consort, Shoor, wants to impress his mistress, while Jorlan, her former consort, sullenly does his duty but casts a curious eye over the prisoners. Any hostile move is met with poisoned crossbow bolts from the drow, and possibly a strike from Ilvara's scourge or a {@spell ray of sickness} spell. The giant spiders attack and poison anyone who attacks the drow. The drow don't kill any of the prisoners (leaving them {@condition unconscious} at 0 hit points) but have no compunction about beating them.": "请自由发挥乌鸦、玩家角色和其他囚犯之间的任何互动。这是一个揭示人物身份的机会，通过角色扮演来充实他们的背景和个性，甚至在你介绍他们的一些同伴的时候。伊尔瓦拉的新妃子肖尔想给他的女主人留下深刻印象，而她的前妃子乔兰则闷闷不乐地履行职责，但对囚犯们投以好奇的目光。任何有敌意的举动都会遭到乌鸦的毒弩箭的攻击，也可能是伊尔瓦拉的祸害或（%0%）法术的打击。巨型蜘蛛会攻击并毒死任何攻击乌鸦的人。乌鸦人没有杀死任何囚犯（让他们（%1%）的命中率为0），但对殴打他们却毫无怨言。",

	"The prisoners are provided with clay chamber pots, and one of the duties of slaves is to empty them into the pool during their shift. There are no other comforts in the slave pen. Prisoners must sit or lie on the stone floor, and are fed only once each day—a thin mushroom broth served in small clay bowls passed through gaps in the bars of the gate.": "囚犯们被提供了粘土箱，奴隶们的职责之一是在轮班时将其倒入水池。奴隶牢房里没有其他舒适的地方。囚犯必须坐在或躺在石板上，每天只吃一次饭--用小土碗盛着稀薄的蘑菇汤，从大门的栅栏缝隙中穿过。",

This pleasant facade conceals the soul of an insane killer. {@creature Buppido|OotA} secretly believes he is the living incarnation of the derro god Diinkarazan—an avatar of murder offering bloody sacrifices to create a path of carnage through the Underdark for his people to follow to glory. He rationalizes any setbacks (including his capture and imprisonment) as part of his \"divine plan.\" His killings are carefully ritualized, following an exacting process of cutting open the victims and arranging their organs.": "一个男性{@creature derro|MTF}，{@creature Buppido|OotA}出人意料地好客和健谈，表现出敏锐的头脑和迷人的态度。这种令人愉快的外表下隐藏着一个疯狂的杀手的灵魂。{@creature Buppido|OotA}秘密地相信他是德鲁神Diinkarazan的活生生的化身--谋杀的化身，提供血腥的牺牲，为他的人民创造一条穿越暗黑世界的屠杀之路，以获得荣耀。他把任何挫折（包括他的被捕和监禁）都合理化为他 \"神圣计划 \"的一部分。他的杀戮是仔细的仪式化的，遵循严格的过程，切开受害者并排列他们的器官。",
	"Although mad, {@creature Buppido|OotA} is cunning and capable of hiding his true nature to serve his own ends. Because he believes he is a god, he is convinced that he can't be killed (or at least that the death of his mortal form means nothing to him), so he is completely fearless. He assumes everything is part of his divine plan, and enthusiastically participates in any plot to escape from the drow so he can continue his holy work. {@creature Buppido|OotA} is happy to consider his fellow prisoners allies until such time as he no longer needs them, or becomes convinced that the omens point toward the need for one or more of them to be sacrificed to his greater glory.": "虽然疯了，但（%0%）很狡猾，能够隐藏自己的真实本性，为自己的目的服务。因为他相信自己是个神，所以他坚信自己不会被杀死（或者至少他的凡人形态的死亡对他来说毫无意义），所以他完全无畏。他认为一切都是他神圣计划的一部分，并热情地参与任何逃离乌鸦的阴谋，以便他能继续他的神圣工作。(在他不再需要他的同伴之前，他很乐意将他们视为盟友，或者确信预兆表明他们中的一个或多个需要为他更大的荣耀而牺牲掉。",

If any of the characters speak to him, however, the quaggoth replies in urbane Elvish. He explains that he is not, in fact, a quaggoth, but a gold elf prince polymorphed into quaggoth form by a curse. He claims to be {@creature Prince Derendil|OotA} of the kingdom of Nelrindenvane in the High Forest. His crown was usurped by the evil wizard Terrestor, who trapped him in this form and exiled him from his people.": "这个大块头（%0%）是奴隶营里看起来最凶猛的囚犯，其他囚犯对他敬而远之。然而，如果有任何人物和他说话，这个夸父就会用彬彬有礼的Elvish语回答。他解释说，事实上他不是夸父，而是一个被诅咒变成夸父形态的金精灵王子。他声称自己是高等森林中的奈尔林登凡王国的（1%）。他的王位被邪恶的巫师泰瑞斯托篡夺，泰瑞斯托将他困在这个形态中，并将他从他的人民中放逐。",
	"Although Derendil behaves like the highborn prince he believes himself to be, he responds to stress—and particularly threats—like a quaggoth: violently tearing foes limb from limb and rending their flesh with sharp claws and teeth. He comes back to himself only after battle, or when someone reinforces his \"true identity\" to snap him out of it. Derendil laments that he is slowly but surely losing himself to the savagery of his quaggoth form.": "虽然德兰迪尔的行为就像他认为自己是高高在上的王子，但他对压力的反应--尤其是对威胁的反应--就像夸父一样：猛烈地将敌人的肢体撕裂，用锋利的爪子和牙齿撕碎他们的肉。只有在战斗结束后，或者当有人强化他的 \"真实身份 \"使他摆脱这种状态时，他才会恢复自我。德兰迪尔哀叹说，他正在慢慢地但肯定地失去自己，被他的夸父形态的野蛮所取代。",
	"In fact, Derendil is simply mad, touched by the delusions of the demon lord Fraz-Urb'luu. The kingdom of Nelrindenvane doesn't exist, and all of \"Derendil's\" recollections and personality are an illusion created by the Demon Prince of Deception. The quaggoth refuses to believe the truth, and any incontrovertible evidence as to his real nature sends him into a murderous rage.": "事实上，Derendil只是疯了，被恶魔领主Fraz-Urb'luu的错觉所触动。内尔林登凡王国并不存在，所有 \"德兰迪尔 \"的回忆和个性都是由欺骗的恶魔王子创造的幻觉。夸父拒绝相信真相，任何关于他真实本性的无可争议的证据都会让他陷入杀戮的愤怒之中。",
	"A female shield dwarf {@creature scout} from Gauntlgrym, Eldeth is high spirited and proud of both her heritage and her people's achievement in reclaiming the ancient dwarven kingdom; she suggests Gauntlgrym as a destination to escape from the Underdark. Eldeth is stubborn and hates the drow and all other \"corrupt dark dwellers\" such as the derro and duergar.": "埃尔德斯是一个来自高特格林姆的女性盾牌矮人（%0%），她热情高涨，为她的遗产和她的人民在夺回古老的矮人王国方面取得的成就感到骄傲；她建议将高特格林姆作为逃离暗黑世界的目的地。埃尔德斯很固执，憎恨鸦人和所有其他 \"腐败的黑暗居民\"，如德鲁人和杜尔加人。",
	"Eldeth wants to get back home, but she is also defiant and self sacrificing—and therefore among the most likely prisoners to perish before getting the opportunity. If that happens, Eldeth asks a character she trusts to promise to carry word of her fate back to her family in Gauntlgrym, along with her shield and warhammer if they are recovered. This might win the characters the approval of Eldeth's kin when they later visit Gauntlgrym.": "埃尔德斯想回家，但她也是个挑衅和自我牺牲的人--因此是最有可能在得到机会之前丧生的囚犯之一。如果发生这种情况，埃尔德斯要求一个她信任的角色承诺将她的命运带回去给她在Gauntlgrym的家人，如果她的盾牌和战锤被找回来的话。这可能会使角色在以后访问Gauntlgrym时赢得Eldeth的亲属的认可。",
	"A male deep gnome {@creature spy}, {@creature Jimjar|OotA} is a feckless rogue with a devil-may-care attitude, a fondness for coin, and an obsession with betting on virtually anything and everything.

He sometimes uses betting to goad others into doing things, but characters can easily turn the tables knowing that {@creature Jimjar|OotA} finds it difficult to refuse a wager. His behavior is unusual for the dour deep gnomes, and others of his kind (including {@creature Topsy|OotA} and {@creature Turvy|OotA}) find {@creature Jimjar|OotA} annoying at best, and unstable and potentially mad at worst.": "一个男性深地精（%0%），（%1%）是一个无精打采的流氓，有一种不顾一切的态度，喜欢钱币，并且痴迷于在几乎所有事情上打赌。一旦他认识了这些人物，{@creature Jimjar|OotA}就经常为他们提供赌注，从他们自己的努力（\"我赌10个金币，你不能在不被发现的情况下通过那个哨兵\"）到随机事件的结果（\"我赌20个金币，这个隧道是正确的\"）。他有时会用打赌来诱导别人做事，但人物很容易翻脸，因为知道（3%）发现很难拒绝赌注。他的行为对于沉闷的深山地精来说是不寻常的，他的其他同类（包括{@creature Topsy|OotA}和{@creature Turvy|OotA}）发现{@creature Jimjar|OotA}充其量是很烦人，最糟糕的是不稳定，可能会发疯。",
	"{@creature Jimjar|OotA} is always true to his word, and he manages to keep exact track of his debits and credits in his head, paying up on his bets (or demanding payment) as soon as possible. He's not above pocketing a little extra coin when no one is watching, and he has an amazing ability to secret significant wealth on his person.": "{@creature Jimjar|OotA}总是言出必行，他设法在脑子里准确地记录下他的借贷情况，尽快付清他的赌注（或要求付款）。他不惜在没人注意的情况下多掏一点钱，而且他有一种惊人的能力，可以将大量的财富藏在自己身上。",

He does his best to get along with everyone, although some find his gregariousness and constant wagers grating.": "{@creature Jimjar|OotA}觉得这对双胞胎{@creature Topsy|OotA}和{@creature Turvy|OotA}好像有些奇怪，但除非被问到，否则他不会发表自己的意见。他尽力与每个人相处，尽管有些人觉得他的好客和不断的赌注令人厌烦。",
	"A male {@creature orc} from the Iceshield tribe, {@creature Ront|OotA} fled from the slaughter of a band of orcs at the hands of the dwarves, falling down a shaft and wandering in the Underdark before being captured by the drow. He's ashamed of his cowardly act and knows that Gruumsh, the god of the orcs, is punishing him. But he also doesn't want to die, or at least not in drow captivity. {@creature Ront|OotA} is mean, stupid, and hateful, but he also knuckles under to authority and threats.

He is aware of his people's well-deserved reputation for madness, and claims to have spent a lifetime in contemplation and solitary meditation to overcome that legacy.

Infected with the curse of lycanthropy, neither deep gnome has entirely embraced it yet, and they struggle to control their wererat instincts and urges. They are fearful of what potential allies might do if they learn the truth, and are looking out for each other and their own survival. With their transformations controlled by the unseen cycle of the moon, you can use the twins' impending change as a wild card in the adventure. They've been prisoners for less than a month, meaning the full moon is coming.": "{@creature Topsy|OotA}和{@creature Turvy|OotA}隐藏了他们是{@creature Wererat||wererats}的事实。感染了狼人的诅咒，两个深山地精都还没有完全接受它，他们努力控制自己的狼人本能和冲动。他们害怕潜在的盟友在得知真相后会做出什么事来，他们正在为彼此和自己的生存着想。由于他们的转变受到看不见的月亮周期的控制，你可以把这对双胞胎即将发生的变化作为冒险中的一张底牌。他们被囚禁了不到一个月，意味着满月即将到来。",
	"The other prisoners who manage to escape with the player characters are likely to become their companions for a substantial part of the adventure, so it is good to lay the groundwork for those relationships early on. Some of the NPCs might not survive the initial escape attempt. Others might be lost to the dangers of the Underdark—or might reveal their true colors and betray the party. A few could become true companions. Keep in mind the other prisoners have their own personalities and goals, but are generally willing to cooperate for their own benefit. Their knowledge of the Underdark should encourage the player characters to keep them around at least initially.": "与玩家角色一起逃脱的其他囚犯可能会在冒险的大部分时间里成为他们的同伴，所以在早期为这些关系打下基础是很好的。有些NPC可能无法在最初的逃跑尝试中存活下来。其他人可能会在暗黑世界的危险中迷失方向，或者可能暴露出他们的真面目并背叛队伍。有几个可能成为真正的伙伴。请记住，其他囚犯有他们自己的个性和目标，但一般都愿意为自己的利益而合作。他们对暗黑世界的了解应该鼓励玩家角色至少在开始时把他们留在身边。",
	"Since managing such a large cast of NPCs can be quite involved, enlist the aid of the players if you wish, having each of them take on the role of managing one or more of the party's companions. The player generally decides what that NPC is doing, with the knowledge that you, as Dungeon Master, can overrule them as needed by the story. Not only does this make the secondary characters easier to manage, it helps the players get to know them and strengthens the bonds between the NPCs and the adventurers.": "由于管理这么多的NPC可能会很麻烦，如果你愿意的话，可以争取玩家的帮助，让他们每个人都扮演管理一个或多个聚会同伴的角色。一般来说，玩家决定该NPC在做什么，而作为地牢主管的你可以根据故事的需要否决他们。这不仅使次要角色更容易管理，而且有助于玩家了解他们，加强NPC和冒险者之间的联系。",
	"Allow the characters to freely mingle and interact with their fellow prisoners or even the drow guards, although the guards rarely talk to the \"surface-dweller scum.\" Of all the prisoners, only Eldeth and {@creature Jimjar|OotA} speak fluent Common.

	"You might wish to consult the social interaction rules in the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}, in which case the other prisoners are initially indifferent toward the characters. Handle the interactions using roleplaying, Charisma checks, or a balance of the two as best suits your group and the way the adventure unfolds.": "你可能希望参考{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}中的社会互动规则，在这种情况下，其他囚犯最初对这些角色是无动于衷的。使用角色扮演、魅力检查或两者的平衡来处理互动，这最适合你的小组和冒险的展开方式。",

	"The drow divide their prisoners into three roughly equal-sized groups and put them to work for a third of the day, supervised by the quaggoths. Their menial tasks include filling and hauling water barrels, operating the lift, cleaning any or all parts of the outpost (whether they need it or not), emptying chamber pots, food preparation and service, washing dishes, and laundry. The prisoners are also given cruel or pointless tasks to occupy them, and for the dark elves' amusement. Such labors include moving or stacking rocks, coiling ropes, and organizing supplies, with prisoners forced to redo work that doesn't meet the drow's arbitrary standards.": "乌鸦把他们的囚犯分成三个大小大致相同的小组，让他们在夸父的监督下工作一天的三分之一。他们的琐碎任务包括填充和拖动水桶、操作电梯、清洁前哨的任何或所有部分（无论他们是否需要）、清空室内的盆子、准备食物和服务、洗碗和洗衣。囚犯们也会被赋予残酷或无意义的任务，以占据他们的时间，并供黑暗精灵们娱乐。这类劳动包括移动或堆放岩石、盘绕绳索、整理物资，囚犯们被迫重做不符合乌鸦任意标准的工作。",
	"Characters might or might not work together, depending on how the drow split them up. Prisoners known to be friendly to each other are usually kept apart, and no more than two or three prisoners are allowed to work at a single task at once.": "角色可能在一起工作，也可能不在一起工作，这取决于鸦人如何将他们分开。已知彼此友好的囚犯通常会被分开，而且不允许超过两到三个囚犯同时从事一项工作。",
	"The drow and quaggoths are cruel and capricious, but also somewhat bored and looking for amusement. The quaggoths are poor conversationalists, hateful and mistrustful toward the prisoners. The drow are more inclined to talk, if only to boast of their superiority. Characters might trick them into dropping useful bits of information, such as how long the journey to Menzoberranzan is expected to take, or that the outpost is relatively close to the Darklake.": "乌鸦和食人魔残忍而任性，但也有些无聊，想找点乐子。奎格斯人不善言谈，对囚犯充满仇恨和不信任。鸦人更倾向于交谈，如果只是为了夸耀他们的优越性的话。角色可能会骗他们说出一些有用的信息，比如去门索布兰赞的旅程预计需要多长时间，或者前哨站离黑暗湖比较近。",
	"The characters' sleep in the slave pen is troubled and fitful, filled with strange dreams and disturbing images. Dark shadows seem to move and reach out toward them as the characters wander lost through endless mazes of tunnels. Oily tentacles slide to brush up against them, while a great buzzing and howling rises in the distance. Suppurating wounds burst open in clouds of spores or crawling masses of maggots or insects. At least one or more of the characters should wake in a cold sweat from these nightmares after every rest, feeling as though something is out there in the dark depths—something far worse than the drow.": "奴隶营中的人物的睡眠是混乱和不稳定的，充满了奇怪的梦和令人不安的图像。当人物在无尽的隧道迷宫中迷失方向时，黑暗的阴影似乎在移动，并向他们伸出手来。油腻的触手滑向他们，而远处传来巨大的嗡嗡声和嚎叫。化脓的伤口在孢子云或爬行的蛆虫或昆虫群中爆裂开来。每次休息后，至少有一个或多个角色应该从这些噩梦中惊醒，感觉好像有什么东西在黑暗的深处--远比乌鸦更可怕。",
	"You need not explain the cause of these dreams and images at this time. Characters can chalk them up to the conditions in the slave pen, or to the aftereffects of drow poison, but they are omens of what is happening in the Underdark. Spellcasters, particularly clerics and warlocks, might be most prone to these dreams, but they can visit any or all of the characters.": "你现在不需要解释这些梦和图像的原因。角色们可以把它们归结为奴隶监狱的条件，或归结为鸦人毒药的后遗症，但它们是暗黑世界正在发生的事情的预兆。施法者，尤其是牧师和术士，可能最容易做这些梦，但它们可以拜访任何或所有角色。",
	"Most of the other prisoners aren't looking for trouble, and even killers such as {@creature Buppido|OotA} are careful to bide their time. Still, both Derendil and {@creature Ront|OotA} have quick tempers, and Sarith the drow is prone to bouts of violence as Zuggtmoy's spores take over his mind. It's possible the characters could provoke a fight. If they do, some of the prisoners (including the deep gnomes) egg on the fighters while others keep their distance or even try to break up the brawl.": "大多数其他的囚犯并不是在找麻烦，即使是像{@creature Buppido|OotA}这样的杀手也会小心翼翼地等待时机。不过，德兰迪尔和(1%)都有急躁的脾气，而乌鸦人萨利斯在祖格莫伊的孢子占据他的头脑时，很容易发生暴力行为。这些人物有可能挑起一场战斗。如果他们这样做了，一些囚犯（包括深层地精）就会对战士们大打出手，而其他人则会保持距离，甚至试图打破争吵的局面。",
	"Any violent conflict draws the attention of the drow guards, who initially order any prisoners to stand down from a fight, threatening them with hand crossbows from outside the gate. If necessary, they shoot prisoners with poisoned crossbow bolts to incapacitate them. (See {@book chapter 8|DMG|8|Poisons} of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide} for information on drow poison.) The guards let any fight play out for their own amusement as long as the prisoners don't seem likely to actually kill one another.": "任何暴力冲突都会引起鸦人守卫的注意，他们最初会命令任何囚犯从战斗中退下，在门外用手弩威胁他们。如果有必要，他们会用带毒的弩箭射杀囚犯，使他们丧失能力。(关于乌鸦毒药的信息，请看{@book chapter 8|DMG|8|Poisons}的{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}。只要囚犯看起来不可能真的互相残杀，守卫们就会让任何争斗上演，供他们自己取乐。",
	"If a prisoner becomes too much trouble, or if the drow need to mete out a lesson on the price of disobedience, they make a gruesome spectacle of feeding a malcontent to the giant spiders in the webs beneath Velkynvelve. Drow guards or quaggoth servants throw the bound prisoner over the edge into the webs, where the spiders quickly converge to bite the victim, injecting their venom. Once the victim is {@condition paralyzed}, the spiders wrap their meal up in webbing.": "如果一个囚犯变得太麻烦了，或者如果鸦人需要教训一下不服从的代价，他们就会制造一个可怕的场面，把不满的人喂给Velkynvelve下面的网里的巨大蜘蛛。鸦人守卫或夸哥特仆人将被捆绑的囚犯从边缘扔进网里，蜘蛛们迅速聚集在一起，咬住受害者，注入毒液。一旦受害者被咬死（%0%），蜘蛛就会用网状物把它们的食物包裹起来。",
	"This event is a convenient opportunity to get rid of one or more of the other prisoners before the escape attempt if you don't want them around. As well, you can drive home the cruelty and threat of the drow by eliminating an NPC with whom the characters have formed a bond.": "如果你不希望其他囚犯在你身边，这个事件是一个方便的机会，可以在逃跑前除掉他们中的一个或多个。此外，你还可以通过消灭一个与角色建立了联系的NPC，让他们明白鸦人的残酷和威胁。",

	"A member of a drow house with a long history as slavers, Ilvara is a cruel mistress who enjoys taunting and tormenting enemies and underlings alike. In addition to a scourge, she wields a {@item tentacle rod}. Although she has taken Shoor Vandree as her lover, Ilvara cares no more about him than she did about Jorlan Duskryn, the lover she discarded due to his crippling injuries.": "伊尔瓦拉是一个有着悠久历史的奴隶主家族的成员，她是一个残忍的女主人，喜欢嘲弄和折磨敌人和下属。除了祸害之外，她还挥舞着一把（%0%）。虽然她把肖尔-范德里当作她的情人，但伊尔瓦拉对他的关心不亚于她对乔兰-杜斯克林的关心，后者是她因伤残而抛弃的情人。",

	"Asha is ambitious enough to know she could assume command of the outpost if anything was to happen to Ilvara, but not courageous enough to challenge her superior openly. She also knows that she would have to impress her superiors in the City of Spiders for any such field promotion to become permanent.

	"This drow elite warrior has assumed the role of Ilvara's lieutenant and lover after the injuries suffered by his predecessor, Jorlan Duskryn. Shoor is relatively young and quite arrogant for a drow male, proud of his abilities and accomplishments.

Still insecure in his position, Shoor feels the need to demonstrate his skill and effectiveness to his mistress and to find ways to please her.": "在他的前任乔兰-杜斯克林受伤后，这位鸦人精英战士承担了伊尔瓦拉的副手和情人的角色。肖尔比较年轻，作为一个鸦人男性，他相当傲慢，对自己的能力和成就感到骄傲。他还在为自己成功赢得伊尔瓦拉的青睐和提升自己在前哨站的地位而感到兴奋，这表现在他的豪迈和他对维尔基维尔其他男性的支配方式上，尤其是乔兰。肖尔对自己的地位仍然没有安全感，他觉得有必要向他的女主人展示他的技能和效率，并想办法取悦她。",

Even the lowest drow understands the inferiority of other creatures, behaving toward the prisoners like sneering nobility. With their superiors, however, the drow are fawning sycophants with a passive-aggressive edge. The males defer to the females, the rank-and-file warriors defer to the elite warriors, and everyone defers to the priestess Ilvara.": "乌鸦人傲慢、残忍、恶毒，把他们的奴隶看成不过是牲畜，对他们冷眼旁观。即使是最低级的乌鸦也明白其他生物的劣势，对囚犯的行为就像讥讽的贵族。然而，对于他们的上级，乌鸦是带着消极攻击性的媚俗的佞人。男性服从于女性，普通战士服从于精英战士，而每个人都服从于女祭司伊尔瓦拉。",

	"A {@creature gray ooze} lurks in the pool's shallows, blending perfectly with the dark, wet stone. It feeds on the waste dumped into the pool, along with the occasional creature that finds its way into the cavern or falls into the pool.": "一只{@creature gray ooze}潜伏在水池的浅滩上，与黑暗、潮湿的石头完美融合。它以倾倒在池子里的废物为食，还有偶尔发现进入洞穴或落入池中的生物。",
	"The inhabitants of Velkynvelve remain unaware that the recent arrival of the demon lord Juiblex in the Underdark has made this ooze particularly aggressive and malevolent. In addition to attacking any creature in the pool, the ooze surges up to 10 feet out of the pool to attack creatures at its edge. When it does so, creatures within 30 feet of the ooze telepathically sense a voice cry out, \"Flesh for the Faceless Lord!\"": "Velkynvelve的居民仍然不知道，最近恶魔领主Juiblex来到地下世界，使得这种渗水变得特别有侵略性和恶意。除了攻击池子里的任何生物外，这股泥浆还能从池子里涌出10英尺，攻击池子边缘的生物。当它这样做的时候，淤泥周围30英尺内的生物会通过心灵感应感觉到一个声音在呼喊：\"为无面者之主的肉体！\"",
	"Unless they want to spend the rest of their lives as drow slaves, the characters should quickly begin looking for ways they can escape. Though the task will not be easy, the characters can take advantage of certain opportunities if they use their heads.": "除非他们想一辈子做乌鸦的奴隶，否则人物应该迅速开始寻找他们可以逃跑的方法。虽然这个任务并不容易，但如果他们动脑筋的话，可以利用某些机会。",
	"One or more of the characters might have useful items in their possession (see \"Scavenged Possessions\"), and working outside the slave pen creates new opportunities for the characters to acquire and hide small items, including makeshift weapons or tools, or even lift a key to the slave pen from a guard. What they can acquire depends on the work they do and where they go. Use the description of the different locations throughout the outpost as a guide to opportunities. Taking something without being noticed requires a successful Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check contested by the Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks of any active observers, or using an observer's passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score as the base DC. A prisoner that fails the check is commanded to relinquish the item, on pain of death.": "一个或多个角色可能拥有有用的物品（见 \"拾取的财物\"），在奴隶营外工作为角色创造了新的机会，可以获得和隐藏小物品，包括临时的武器或工具，甚至可以从守卫那里取到奴隶营的钥匙。他们能获得什么，取决于他们所做的工作和他们去的地方。用整个前哨站不同地点的描述作为机会的指南。在不被注意的情况下拿东西需要成功的灵巧（（%0%））检查，由任何主动观察者的智慧（（%1%））检查来争夺，或者用观察者的被动智慧（（%2%））得分作为基础DC。检查失败的囚犯会被命令放弃该物品，否则将被处以死刑。",
	"What equipment and treasures the characters claim during their escape depend on how much of the outpost they are able to explore before fleeing. For some characters, it might be a fun challenge to escape into the Underdark with little more than the clothes on their backs. For others (including spellcasters who need spellbooks or components), consider placing the party's captured equipment (normally in Ilvara's quarters) in an alternate location if the characters are intent on escaping without exploring all of the outpost, such as the elite drow barracks (area 4) or the armory (area 10).": "角色在逃亡过程中能得到什么装备和宝物，取决于他们在逃亡前能探索多少前哨站的地方。对于一些角色来说，除了身上的衣服之外，逃到地下世界可能是一个有趣的挑战。对于其他人（包括需要法术书或组件的施法者）来说，如果角色们打算在没有探索完前哨站的情况下逃跑，可以考虑将队伍中缴获的装备（通常在伊尔瓦拉的住处）放在另一个地方，比如精英鸦人兵营（4区）或军械库（10区）。",
	"When the initial contact between the adventurers and the other prisoners has been played out, Jorlan Duskryn arranges to bring the prisoners their food during his guard duty. (Shoor delights in giving Jorlan such menial work). Standing at the gate to the slave pen and passing in bowls, he mutters to the nearest character: \"If I could give you a means to escape from here, would you take it?\"": "当冒险者和其他囚犯之间的初步接触结束后，乔兰-杜斯克林安排他在看守期间为囚犯们送去食物。(肖尔以给乔兰这样的琐碎工作为乐）。他站在通往奴隶围栏的门口，递上碗，对最近的人物嘀咕道。\"如果我可以给你一个逃离这里的方法，你会接受吗？\"",
	"If the answer is affirmative, Jorlan quickly and quietly proposes to leave the gate to the slave pen unlocked, as well as to create a distraction during the changing of the guards on duty. He tells the characters about the armory, located in the chamber above the guard post in the hanging guard tower in front of the slave pen. The escapees can jump down into the webs below, then over the edge into the pool, making their escape from there.": "如果答案是肯定的，乔兰迅速而悄悄地提议不锁上通往奴隶圈的大门，并在换岗时制造分心。他告诉人物关于军械库的情况，军械库位于奴隶围栏前的悬空警卫塔的岗哨上方的密室中。逃跑的人可以跳到下面的网里，然后从边缘跳到水池里，从那里逃跑。",
	"Jorlan doesn't particularly care if the prisoners actually escape, which is why he doesn't offer any further help or warn them about the {@creature gray ooze} in the pool. It suits him just as well if the prisoners are killed during their attempt to flee. He simply wants to create an embarrassing incident for Shoor and Ilvara.": "乔兰并不特别关心囚犯是否真的逃脱，这就是为什么他没有提供任何进一步的帮助，也没有警告他们池子里的（%0%）。如果囚犯在试图逃跑的过程中被杀，这对他来说也很合适。他只是想给肖尔和伊尔瓦拉制造一个尴尬的事件。",
	"Jorlan furtively glances around as he speaks quickly to the characters. If they question him or ask for changes to the plan, he insists it is all he can do. If they accept, he is true to his word, leaving the gate unlocked close to the next guard shift change and delaying the replacement guards for a few minutes.": "乔兰一边对人物快速说话，一边鬼鬼祟祟地四处扫视。如果他们质疑他或要求改变计划，他坚持认为这是他能做的一切。如果他们接受了，他就言出必行，在接近下一次警卫换班的时候把大门解锁，把替换的警卫推迟几分钟。",
	"During a guard change, the prisoners hear a horrible droning buzz echoing through the cavern, followed by inhuman shrieking. Alarm horns sound out as four {@creature chasme} demons pursue a pair of {@creature vrock} demons into the cavern from the northern passage. The demons swoop and buzz around, initially ignoring other creatures as both groups savagely assault each other. The demons' arrival catches all of the drow off guard.": "在换岗时，囚犯们听到可怕的嗡嗡声在洞穴里回荡，接着是非人的尖叫声。当四个{@creature chasme}恶魔追赶一对{@creature vrock}恶魔从北部通道进入洞穴时，警报喇叭响了起来。恶魔们俯冲着，嗡嗡作响，最初无视其他生物，因为两组恶魔都在野蛮地攻击对方。恶魔们的到来让所有的乌鸦都措手不及。",
	"The drow rush to defend the outpost from a possible attack. The demons initially buzz past the hanging towers, leaving the walkways and caverns out of range of the effects of their droning and screeching. However, drow and quaggoths in the towers are close enough to be affected. The aerial battle eventually circles around the platform and the towers of the elite warriors as the demons savagely tear into each other.": "乌鸦们匆匆忙忙地保卫前哨站，以免受到可能的攻击。恶魔们最初从悬空的塔楼上嗡嗡作响，将走道和洞穴排除在它们的叨叨声和尖叫声的影响范围之外。然而，塔楼里的乌鸦和夸父都很近，足以受到影响。空中战斗最终围绕着平台和精锐战士的塔楼展开，因为恶魔们野蛮地撕咬着对方。",
	"The drow move to engage the demons and defend the outpost, leaving the characters with an opportunity to escape. You can combine this event with Jorlan's offer to leave the gate unlocked, making it easy for the characters to slip away. Alternatively (or if they refuse Jorlan's offer), the characters can use the distraction to engineer their own breakout, then decide how to get down to the cavern floor and where to go after that.": "乌鸦人开始与恶魔交战并保卫前哨，给角色们留下了逃跑的机会。你可以将这一事件与乔兰的提议结合起来，让大门不上锁，让角色们很容易溜走。另外（或者如果他们拒绝了乔兰的提议），角色们可以利用这次分心来设计自己的突围，然后决定如何下到洞穴的地板上，之后去哪里。",
	"Describe the chaos of the demon attack and the drow's response as the escaped prisoners try to flee. The characters can follow Jorlan's suggestion to drop into the webs and then dive into the pool, possibly dealing with a {@creature giant spider} or two and the {@creature gray ooze} along the way. Alternatively, they can look for another way down. Reaching the lift requires getting past the drow clustered on the platform and then attempting to operate it during the attack, which might prove difficult.": "描述恶魔袭击的混乱场面以及逃跑的囚犯试图逃离时乌鸦的反应。角色们可以按照乔兰的建议掉进网里，然后跳进池子里，沿途可能要对付一两个（%0%）和（%1%）。或者，他们也可以寻找另一条路下去。到达升降机需要越过聚集在平台上的乌鸦，然后在攻击期间尝试操作它，这可能会证明是困难的。",
	"If you want to provide an additional challenge for the characters, a {@creature vrock} tumbles almost in front of them as they reach the cavern floor or move toward their chosen exit. The demon is badly wounded, but even with only 11 hit points remaining and having expended its spores and stunning screech abilities, it is still quite dangerous. It screeches at the characters, but if they do nothing to threaten it for 1 round, the demon takes wing and launches itself back into the fight overhead.": "如果你想为角色提供一个额外的挑战，当他们到达洞穴地面或向他们选择的出口移动时，一个（%0%）几乎在他们面前翻滚着。这只恶魔受了重伤，但即使只剩下11点命中率，而且已经用完了它的孢子和令人震惊的尖叫能力，它仍然相当危险。它对着角色尖叫，但如果他们在一回合内没有做任何事情来威胁它，恶魔就会展翅高飞，回到头顶的战斗中。",
	"If the adventurers take on the fallen vrock and defeat or escape from it, award them a quarter of its usual XP value, or 575 XP, given its weakened state.": "如果冒险家们对付堕落的岩浆并击败它或从它手中逃脱，鉴于它的虚弱状态，奖励他们四分之一的通常XP值，或575XP。",
	"If Jorlan is alive when the demons attack, he might use the distraction to free the prisoners (as described in \"Jorlan's Gambit\").

	"The characters have three choices for leaving Velkynvelve: the north, west, and south passages.": "角色们有三种离开Velkynvelve的选择：北部、西部和南部的通道。",
	"This leads toward Menzoberranzan (see {@area chapter 15|4e4|x}) and, eventually, Blingdenstone (see {@adventure chapter 6|OotA|5}).

	"Unless they obtain a supply of food and water, the adventurers must forage to survive on their journey. Finding sustenance in the Underdark is difficult but not impossible. Characters can gather food and water if the party travels at a normal or slow pace. A foraging character makes a Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check.

If the pursuit level reaches 5, the drow forward scouts catch up to them, and the drow leaders arrive not long thereafter (see \"{@area Catching Up|07b|x}\"). If the pursuit level drops to 0, the party has eluded the drow until circumstances bring both factions into contact again (see \"{@area Eluding Pursuit|07c|x}\").": "乌鸦追击的密切程度由追击等级来衡量。它从4级开始，乌鸦在人物后面不远处。如果追击等级达到5，乌鸦的前哨侦察兵就会追上他们，而乌鸦首领也会在不久之后到达（见\"{@area Catching Up|07b|x}\"）。如果追击水平下降到0，那么这支队伍就躲过了乌鸦的追击，直到环境使两派再次接触（见\"{@area Eluding Pursuit|07c|x}\"）。",
	"Characters can increase or decrease the pursuit level in the following ways:": "角色可以通过以下方式提高或降低追求水平。",
	"Decrease the pursuit level by 1 for each day the party travels at a fast pace.": "队伍在快速行进的过程中，每一天减少1个追击等级。",
	"Decrease the pursuit level by 1 if a character spends time covering up the party's trail that day, requiring a successful DC 16 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check.": "如果一个角色在当天花时间掩盖队伍的踪迹，则追击等级降低1，需要成功进行DC 16智慧（（%0%））检查。",
	"Decrease the pursuit level by 1 each time the characters cross or traverse some feature that obscures their trail, such as a subterranean river.": "每次人物穿过或穿越一些掩盖其踪迹的特征时，如地下河，追击等级就会降低1。",
	"Decrease the pursuit level by 1 if the party splits into two or more groups. Each group becomes a separate party for purposes of determining random encounters and whether or not the group becomes lost.": "如果队伍分成两组或更多组，追击等级减少1。在确定随机遭遇和是否迷路时，每组都成为一个单独的队伍。",
	"Increase the pursuit level by 1 each time the party has a random encounter with one or more creatures, unless the encounter is bypassed or avoided entirely.": "每次聚会与一个或多个生物发生随机遭遇时，追击等级增加1，除非该遭遇被绕过或完全避开。",
	"Increase the pursuit level by 1 for each day the adventurers travel at a slow pace.": "冒险者以缓慢的速度旅行，每一天增加1个追击等级。",
	"Certain terrain encounters increase or decrease the pursuit level. See the individual descriptions in the \"Random Encounters\" section.": "某些地形的遭遇会增加或减少追击水平。见 \"随机遭遇 \"部分的个别描述。",
	"The players might come up with additional ways of evading pursuit. Adjudicate these as you see fit. For example, if the characters convince a randomly encountered creature to let them pass by telling them about the wealthy drow following them, you might reduce the pursuit level by 1 as the drow are forced to deal with the encounter before they can resume tracking the party. Similarly, the adventurers could lay traps to slow down their pursuers, or they might convince a friendly creature to lie to the drow about which way the party went.": "队员们可能会想出更多的方法来逃避追捕。按照你认为合适的方式进行裁决。例如，如果角色们说服一个随机遇到的生物让他们通过，告诉他们有一个富有的乌鸦在跟踪他们，你可以将追捕等级降低1，因为乌鸦被迫在继续跟踪队伍之前处理好这次遭遇。同样地，冒险者们可以布置陷阱来减缓追捕者的速度，或者他们可以说服一个友好的生物向乌鸦撒谎，告诉他们队伍走了哪条路。",
	"If you choose to skip over a few days of travel (as described under \"{@area Summarizing Travel|0ac|x}\" later in this chapter), the pursuit level doesn't change during that time.": "如果你选择跳过几天的旅行（如本章后面的\"{@area Summarizing Travel|0ac|x} \"中所述），在这段时间里，追求水平不会改变。",
	"When the pursuit level reaches 5, the drow forward scouts spot the party. At this point, the pursuit might become an encounter if the characters spot the drow and engage them. The characters might try to run, at which point a chase ensues (see \"{@book Chases|DMG|8|Chases}\" in chapter 8 of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}), or they might stand and fight. They might even try to set up some sort of ambush, since the front ranks of the party are likely out of sight of the drow when they first catch up.": "当追击等级达到5级时，乌鸦的前哨侦察兵发现了这支队伍。这时，如果角色们发现了乌鸦并与之交战，追击就可能变成一场遭遇战。角色们可能会试图逃跑，这时就会发生追逐（见《(1%)》第8章的\"{@book Chases|DMG|8|Chases}\"），或者他们可能会站起来战斗。他们甚至可以尝试设下某种埋伏，因为当他们第一次追上乌鸦时，队伍的前排很可能已经离开了他们的视线。",
	"If the adventurers flee and successfully escape, they lower the pursuit level to 4 and begin avoiding their pursuers again. If they fight the drow, run the encounter. The drow scouts focus on maintaining close pursuit and peppering the characters with poisoned hand crossbow bolts. After {@dice 1d6 + 4} rounds, the remainder of the drow party (Ilvara, Asha, Jorlan, and Shoor) catches up and joins the encounter.": "如果冒险者逃跑并成功逃脱，他们会将追击等级降低到4级，并再次开始躲避追兵。如果他们与乌鸦战斗，则进行遭遇战。乌鸦人的侦察兵专注于保持近距离追击，并用带毒的手弩箭攻击角色。在{@dice 1d6 + 4}回合之后，乌鸦队伍的其余成员（伊尔瓦拉、阿莎、乔兰和肖尔）追了上来，加入了这场遭遇战。",
	"If the adventurers lower the pursuit level to 0, the drow lose the trail unless circumstances allow them to locate the characters again. This might include the characters spending a day or more in a place where they are recognized, or where they talk openly about their escape from Velkynvelve. If the characters pass through an area watched over by drow scouts or spies, Ilvara will inevitably hear word of the characters' location. When this occurs, increase the pursuit level to 1 and begin tracking it again as the drow pick up the trail once more.": "如果冒险者将追捕等级降至0，那么乌鸦就会失去踪迹，除非情况允许他们再次找到这些人物。这可能包括人物在一个他们被认出的地方呆上一天或更久，或者他们在那里公开谈论他们从Velkynvelve逃出来的事情。如果这些角色经过了一个由鸦人侦察员或间谍监视的区域，伊尔瓦拉将不可避免地听到这些角色位置的消息。当这种情况发生时，将追捕级别提高到1，并在乌鸦再次拾起线索时再次开始追踪。",
	"If an encounter with the drow is going badly and you don't want the characters recaptured, you can always have fate intercede on their behalf with another encounter or event offering a distraction.": "如果与乌鸦的遭遇很糟糕，而你又不想让角色被抓回来，你可以让命运替他们出面，用另一个遭遇或事件来转移他们的注意力。",
	"For example, a wandering stone giant, a purple worm, or a pack of savage gnolls whipped into a frenzy by Yeenoghu might show up just as the drow have the characters cornered, giving them a chance to run. Likewise, a minor earthquake (caused by instability from the demonic incursion or a wild magic surge) might cause a cave-in, cutting off a tunnel between the party and their pursuers, and dropping the pursuit level by 1 or 2.": "例如，一个游荡的石巨人、一只紫色的虫子，或者一群被耶诺古激怒的野蛮地精，可能会在乌鸦把角色逼到角落时出现，给他们一个逃跑的机会。同样地，一场小地震（由恶魔入侵的不稳定性或狂野的魔法涌动引起）可能会导致洞穴坍塌，切断队伍与追兵之间的通道，并使追击等级下降1或2。",
	"Don't do this so often that the players feel they haven't earned it, but use it as an option to keep the pursuit going rather than coming to an anticlimactic conclusion.": "不要经常这样做，以至于玩家觉得他们没有赚到钱，但要把它作为一个选项，让追击的过程继续下去，而不是以一种反常的方式结束。",
	"The drow try to capture the escaped prisoners if at all possible, since Ilvara wants the pleasure of teaching them a lesson about disobedience. If the dark elves reduce any characters to 0 hit points, those characters are knocked out rather than dying (see \"{@book Knocking a Creature Out|PHB|9|Knocking a Creature Out}\" in chapter 9 of the {@i Player's Handbook}). Even if one or more of the characters are accidentally killed, Ilvara is obsessed enough to cast {@spell raise dead} to restore them to life (assuming the character's soul is willing to return).": "如果可能的话，乌鸦人试图抓住逃跑的囚犯，因为伊尔瓦拉希望能愉快地给他们一个关于不服从的教训。如果黑暗精灵将任何角色的命中率降至0，这些角色就会被击倒而不是死亡（见《{@book Knocking a Creature Out|PHB|9|Knocking a Creature Out}》第九章的\"{@i Player's Handbook}\"）。即使一个或多个角色被意外杀死，伊尔瓦拉也会执着地施展（%%2%）来恢复他们的生命（假设该角色的灵魂愿意回归）。",
	"Captured characters are disarmed, their hands bound with spider-silk rope, and gagged. The drow march them back to Velkynvelve unless Menzoberranzan is closer, in which case Ilvara takes them there instead. The characters will need to come up with a new plan of escape, ideally before Ilvara has the opportunity to torture them or sell them into slavery in the City of Spiders. If they escape her clutches again, the drow priestess continues her pursuit until she is dead or the party leaves the Underdark (see {@adventure chapter 7|OotA|6}).": "被俘的人物被解除武装，双手被蜘蛛丝绳绑住，并被塞住嘴。鸦人将他们押送回维尔基维尔，除非门索伯兰山更近，在这种情况下，伊尔瓦拉将他们带到那里。角色们需要想出一个新的逃跑计划，最好是在伊尔瓦拉有机会折磨他们或把他们卖到蜘蛛之城为奴之前。如果他们再次逃出她的魔掌，鸦人女祭司就会继续追捕他们，直到她死了或者队伍离开暗黑世界（见（%0%））。",
	"Each day of travel through the Underdark, check twice to see if the characters encounter anything unusual: once while they are traveling, and again while they are camped or resting.

	"Since there is no wind in the Underdark, all water travel involves either rowing at 1½ miles per hour, or floating with prevailing currents at 1 mile per hour. Characters can work in shifts to row more than 8 hours per day, but crewing a boat for longer than that is considered a forced march (see {@book chapter 8|PHB|8|Travel Pace} of the {@i Player's Handbook}).": "由于暗黑世界没有风，所有的水上旅行都是以每小时1.5英里的速度划船，或者以每小时1英里的速度随水流漂浮。角色可以轮流工作，每天划船超过8小时，但划船时间超过8小时则被视为强制行军（见{@i Player's Handbook}的{@book chapter 8|PHB|8|Travel Pace}）。",

Some are completely submerged, navigable only by those able to breathe underwater.": "黑暗湖是由湖泊、水路和运河组成的巨大迷宫，连接着无数的洞穴和房间。其中一些洞穴非常巨大，水深不可估量，拱形的天花板远远超出任何光线的范围。另一些则很狭窄，天花板和水面之间只有几英尺的空间。有些则完全被淹没，只有能够在水下呼吸的人才能航行。",
	"Without the sky or the stars to navigate by, any successful passage of the Darklake relies on one's familiarity with its intricate network of caverns, passages, and currents.

Such knowledge is something that takes years, if not decades, of wandering the Darklake to acquire.Those without the skill to navigate the Darklake (including the adventurers) must employ maps or guides.

Ploopploopeen wants the characters to disrupt the upstart faction's rituals, allowing his true believers of the Sea Mother to cut off the head of the cult. The archpriest promises that the characters will be \"well rewarded\" for their aid.": "海之母的大神官告诉这些人物，他想用他们作为诱饵。深海之父的大神官需要人形的祭品，而这一行人在这方面代表了一个奖品的收集。Ploopploopeen将把这些角色作为 \"和平与和解的信物\"，以接近深海之父的大祭司--只不过冒险者们将不是无助的囚犯，而是渗透者。Ploopploopeen希望角色们能破坏新晋派别的仪式，让他的海之母的真正信徒砍掉邪教的头。大祭司承诺，这些人物将因为他们的帮助而得到 \"丰厚的回报\"。",

	"It might well be that the kuo-toa's former masters—the mind flayers—used them as ferry pilots and navigators in the Underdark, and the fish-folk continue to do so out of habit or some deep-seated need. Certainly, their relative usefulness to the other races of the Underdark has served the kuo-toa well. Only the duergar have shown any interest in navigating the waters of the Darklake on their own, and not even they do it as well as the kuo-toa.": "很可能是Kuo-toa以前的主人--心灵传播者--把它们作为暗黑世界的渡轮驾驶员和导航员，而鱼人继续这样做是出于习惯或某种根深蒂固的需要。当然，他们对暗黑世界其他种族的相对有用性对Kuo-toa很有帮助。只有杜尔加人对自己在暗黑湖的水域中航行表现出任何兴趣，甚至他们也没有像国土人那样做得好。",
	"There is a persistent myth among the inhabitants of Sloobludop that the maze of tunnels, passages, and pools of the Darklake is a kind of meditation—a spiritual journey.

	"{@creature Buppido|OotA} (see {@area chapter 1|008|x}) and Hemeth (see {@area chapter 3|12a|x}) are the only NPCs who actively suggest going to Gracklstugh. They know that duergar have no love for the drow, and their draconian laws keep all foreigners in check, which should provide some measure of sanctuary from drow pursuit. Gracklstugh is as good a place as any in the Underdark to sell stolen gear and buy more useful equipment. Additionally, the duergar trade actively with other subterranean and surface-dwelling races. Gracklstugh's Blade Bazaar might be the ideal place to find traders or explorers heading to the surface world.": "{@creature Buppido|OotA}（见{@area chapter 1|008|x}）和Hemeth（见{@area chapter 3|12a|x}）是唯一积极建议去Gracklstugh的NPC。他们知道杜尔加人对乌鸦没有好感，他们的严酷法律控制着所有的外国人，这应该能提供某种程度的避难所，让他们免受乌鸦的追捕。Gracklstugh是暗黑世界中最适合出售偷来的装备和购买更多有用装备的地方。此外，杜尔加人还积极地与其他地下和地面居住的种族进行贸易。格拉克斯图的刀锋集市可能是寻找前往地表世界的商人或探险家的理想场所。",
	"If {@creature Buppido|OotA} or Hemeth isn't with the party, others can provide the above information. Sarith resists plans to travel to the city at first, conscious of the low regard the duergar have for drow. He changes his mind quickly, however, as Zuggtmoy's spores drive him to seek a densely populated area where he can spread his contagion.": "如果{@creature Buppido|OotA}或Hemeth不在队伍中，其他人可以提供上述信息。Sarith起初抵制前往城市的计划，因为他意识到杜尔加人对乌鸦的轻视。然而，他很快就改变了主意，因为祖格莫伊的孢子促使他寻找一个人口稠密的地区，在那里他可以传播他的传染病。",
	"It's also possible the party arrives at Gracklstugh involuntarily. Duergar slavers scour the Underdark in search of new \"merchandise,\" and they might deceive or outright capture the characters and bring them to their city's slave markets. The random encounters in chapters 2 and 3 can easily set up this scenario.": "他们也有可能不由自主地来到了格拉克尔斯图。Duergar奴隶主在暗黑世界中寻找新的 \"商品\"，他们可能会欺骗或直接捕获角色，并将他们带到他们城市的奴隶市场。第2章和第3章中的随机遭遇可以很容易地设置这个场景。",
	"Taking refuge in Gracklstugh has its advantages. Each day they spend in the duergar capital, the characters can attempt a DC 16 group Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check to move around cautiously, with success indicating that they avoid drawing attention to themselves. The characters can also attempt a DC 13 group Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check to assess the mood in the city, with success allowing them to avoid trouble before it starts. Characters who lie low for the day have advantage on this Wisdom check.": "在Gracklstugh避难有其好处。在duergar首都度过的每一天，人物都可以尝试用DC16的团体灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）检查来谨慎行动，成功后表明他们可以避免引起注意。角色还可以尝试DC13的群体智慧（{@skill Insight}）检查来评估城市的情绪，成功后可以在麻烦开始之前避免麻烦。躺在地上一天的人物在这个智慧检查上有优势。",
	"Success with either check reduces the party's pursuit level by 1 (see \"{@area Drow Pursuit|078|x}\" in chapter 2).": "任何一项检查的成功都会使本方的追击等级降低1（见第2章的\"（%0%）\"）。",
	"The Darklake District is a likely entry point to the city for the characters, whether they arrive via the water or travel one of the many tunnels leading to the district's gates. Non-duergar arriving from tunnels that lead to other districts are stopped and escorted to the Darklake District under heavy guard, as every other district is normally off limits to outsiders, and trespassers risk being confronted by an {@condition invisible} patrol of four duergar.": "黑暗湖区是人物进入城市的一个可能的入口，无论他们是通过水路还是通过通往该区大门的许多隧道到达。从通往其他地区的隧道到达的非龙人被拦住，并在严密的警卫下被护送到暗湖区，因为其他地区通常是禁止外人进入的，闯入者有可能被四名龙人组成的（%0%）巡逻队撞见。",
	"The party's fellow escapees know that trying to enter through the main entrances is a sure way to get enslaved, unless one of the characters is an epic liar who can convince the guards the party is a legitimate diplomatic or trade delegation. Anyone with a merchant or criminal background has heard rumors that the Zhentarim trade in the Underdark, but posing as Zhentarim has its own risks, as such claims are bound to be questioned. A character who is actually a member of the Zhentarim can buy the adventurers a couple of days inside the city before the duergar slavers start taking their measure.": "队伍的同伴们知道，试图从主要入口进入肯定会被奴役，除非其中一个角色是个史诗般的骗子，能让守卫相信队伍是一个合法的外交或贸易代表团。任何有商人或犯罪背景的人都听说过赞塔林在暗黑世界进行贸易的传闻，但冒充赞塔林也有其风险，因为这种说法必然会受到质疑。一个真正是赞塔林成员的角色可以为冒险者争取到几天的时间，在杜尔加奴隶主开始打量他们之前，他们可以在城内停留几天。",
	"Arriving by way of the Darklake Docks is easier and more discreet. If the characters are traveling by boat, {@creature Buppido|OotA} can guide them to a deserted pier where they can dock quietly. He warns them that they have to keep a low profile and head directly to the only inn in the city devoted to outsiders. The Ghohlbrorn's Lair is frequented by merchants, mercenaries, and other foreigners who can offer information about traveling elsewhere in the Underdark—or perhaps even to the surface world.": "通过暗湖码头到达更容易，也更隐蔽。如果人物是乘船旅行，{@creature Buppido|OotA}可以引导他们到一个废弃的码头，在那里他们可以安静地停靠。他警告他们必须保持低调，并直接前往城市中唯一专门为外来者服务的旅馆。Ghohlbrorn's Lair是商人、雇佣兵和其他外国人经常光顾的地方，他们可以提供有关在暗黑世界其他地方旅行的信息，甚至可能是到地面世界的信息。",
	"Sweltering heat and cloying smoke cling to every corner of the duergar city, spewing from smelters housed inside massive stalagmites and stalactites. These protrude from the cavern's floor and ceiling like the teeth of some great maw.": "闷热的天气和令人窒息的烟雾笼罩着杜尔加城市的每一个角落，从装在巨大的石笋和钟乳石里的冶炼厂喷出。这些石笋和钟乳石从洞穴的地板和天花板上伸出来，就像一些大嘴的牙齿。",
	"Gracklstugh's glowing forges and smithies operate continuously. Most of the city is dimly lit by a hellish red glow, with patches of darkness here and there.": "Gracklstugh的发光锻造厂和铁匠铺持续运作。城市的大部分地区都被地狱般的红光照亮，这里和那里都有一些黑暗的斑点。",
	"The clanging and clacking of hammers and machinery echoes constantly throughout the city. Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks made to listen in Gracklstugh have disadvantage.": "锤子和机器的叮叮当当声在整个城市不断回响。在Gracklstugh进行的智慧({@skill Perception})检查对倾听是不利的。",
	"Despite vents dug into the walls and ceiling of the city's great cavern, fumes from smelters and forges linger at ground level (as does the gas tapped in Laduguer's Furrow). Visitors might contract the illness known as grackle-lung (see the Grackle-lung sidebar).": "尽管在城市大洞穴的墙壁和天花板上挖有通风口，但冶炼厂和锻造厂的烟气仍在地面上徘徊（就像在拉杜古尔沟挖掘的气体一样）。游客可能会感染被称为鹩哥肺的疾病（见 \"鹩哥肺 \"边栏）。",
	"With routine patrols of heavily armed gray dwarves who can turn {@condition invisible}, Gracklstugh is a relatively safe place for those who know where they belong and stay there. However, tensions are rising because of the influence of Demogorgon, and the characters have many opportunities to participate in events unfolding in the city. At the end of each long rest, roll a {@dice d20}; on a roll of 17–20, an encounter takes place.

	"Wary outsiders visiting Gracklstugh quickly learn the most important details of life in the city.": "警惕的外来者在访问格拉克斯图的时候，很快就了解到了城市生活中最重要的细节。",
	"The duergar power of invisibility plays a significant role in their society. The potential presence of unseen spies everywhere enforces honesty among duergar. Slaves rarely, if ever, talk or act against their masters, never knowing who might be watching.": "杜尔加人的隐形能力在他们的社会中起着重要作用。到处都有看不见的间谍的潜在存在，这使得杜尔加人的诚实性得到加强。奴隶们很少（如果有的话）谈论或采取行动反对他们的主人，因为他们从不知道谁可能在监视。",
	"Not only is the layout of Gracklstugh divided, so are its people. Nearly five hundred years ago, the derro launched a Uniting War against the Deepkingdom, but were swiftly crushed, and the survivors brought back to Gracklstugh in chains.

	"The gray dwarves value efficiency, stoicism, and hard work, and these values are exemplified in their capital. Everything the duergar make or build has a purpose and function; the only aesthetic they value in architecture is imposing vastness, and even that is secondary to a building's structural function. The only ornamentations found in Gracklstugh are iconic representations of rank and function within duergar society, and the only music is the ceaseless rhythmic hammering in the forges. The duergar consider art a frivolous pursuit, and only rarely appreciate or create it.": "灰矮人重视效率、坚忍和努力工作，这些价值观在他们的资本中得到了体现。灰矮人制造或建造的所有东西都有其目的和功能；他们在建筑方面唯一重视的美学就是宏伟的规模，即使这也是次要的，因为建筑的结构功能。在Gracklstugh发现的唯一的装饰品是二重奏社会中等级和功能的标志性代表，唯一的音乐是锻造厂里无休止的有节奏的敲击声。duergar人认为艺术是一种轻浮的追求，而且很少欣赏或创造它。",
	"The lairds and merchants who sit at this council make sure that trade and commerce flow smoothly. They employ slave labor to maintain trade routes in the dangerous Underdark, and are always open to hiring explorers to check out leads on potential new routes. Expendable outsiders hired as caravan guards always take point and receive little aid or support from the caravan masters. Despite these unfair assignments, the duergar always live up to their bargains, paying survivors as promised.": "坐在议会里的领主和商人们确保贸易和商业的顺利进行。他们雇佣奴隶来维护危险的暗黑世界的贸易路线，并且总是愿意雇佣探险家来检查潜在的新路线的线索。被雇为商队守卫的消耗品的外来者总是拿着点，很少得到商队主人的援助或支持。尽管有这些不公平的任务，杜尔加人总是履行他们的协议，按照承诺支付幸存者。",
	"In addition to the clans' regular armies, Gracklstugh trains specialized warriors whose oaths of service always supersede their original loyalties. See {@adventure appendix C|OotA|19} for more information.": "除了部族的正规军，格拉克尔斯特还训练专门的战士，他们的服役誓言总是取代他们原来的忠诚。更多信息见{@adventure appendix C|OotA|19}。",

	"Despite reports that the darkhafts and the Stone Guards have received about the growing crisis outside the city's walls, hubris and the onset of madness prevents them from mounting any sort of response or campaign, blind to the corruption that festers around them.": "尽管暗堡和石卫收到了关于城墙外日益严重的危机的报告，但傲慢和疯狂的出现使他们无法采取任何形式的回应或行动，对他们周围发酵的腐败视而不见。",
	"The constant smog in Gracklstugh causes grackle-lung in living, breathing creatures, resulting in persistent, wracking coughs and the spewing of thick, black phlegm. Whenever a living, breathing creature finishes a long rest in Gracklstugh, it must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw.

	"If a creature's {@condition exhaustion} level drops below 1, it no longer suffers the effects of grackle-lung and becomes immune to it for the next week.

	"The stone giants of Clan Cairngorm lead quiet lives of art and contemplation in Gracklstugh. Although reclusive and averse to conflict, the giants have sworn an ancient oath of loyalty to the Deepking, and have been serving his line for as long as any can remember.

If the throne passes to another dynasty, the stone giants will cease to be the city's allies.": "凯恩戈姆氏族的石头巨人在格雷克尔斯图过着安静的艺术和沉思的生活。虽然隐居并不喜欢冲突，但这些巨人对深王发下了古老的忠诚誓言，并且从人们有记忆以来就一直为他的家族服务。然而，这个誓言只给了钢影氏族。如果王位传给另一个王朝，石巨人将不再是城市的盟友。",
	"The leader of the stone giants is Stonespeaker Hgraam, a priest of Skoraeus Stonebones, the god of his people. Hgraam is wise and knowledgeable.

	"The Wyrmsmith is beginning to chafe under the Keepers' control. He now wonders why he is content with a mere trickle of gold and a paltry handful of slaves, when he could simply force the entire city to bend knee to him and give him everything he desires. For now, his actions are limited by how little he cares about the duergar and how much the Keepers speak \"on his behalf.\" But he has begun taking an interest in the affairs of Gracklstugh and the opportunity to recruit new servants from outside the Keepers of the Flame, using his outings to rekindle forges and smelters as a means to keep an eye out for promising subjects.": "在守护者的控制下，巫师开始感到不安。他现在想知道为什么他只满足于涓涓细流的黄金和一小撮奴隶，而他可以简单地迫使整个城市向他屈膝，给他想要的一切。目前，他的行动受到了限制，因为他对杜尔加的关心程度很低，而且守卫者们 \"代表他 \"说话。但他已经开始对格拉克尔斯图的事务和从火焰守护者之外招募新仆人的机会感兴趣，利用他外出重燃锻造厂和冶炼厂的机会，留意有前途的对象。",

	"The {@i Forak-Erach-Naek} (\"Empty-Scabbard Killers\" in Common) are a folktale in Gracklstugh, their name derived from an ancient, obscure Dwarvish dialect.

	"The duergar are called gray dwarves not only because of the color of their skin, but also because of their drab and joyless lifestyle.

	"By appearance and bearing, all duergar know their place and where they belong. Whether as individuals, families, or entire clans, duergar below other duergar in the social order don't seek to bring their rivals down through intrigue and deceit.

	"Duergar clans use caverns under Gracklstugh and choice outlying caves to farm a variety of plants and fungi. These crops are complemented by meat from Underdark beasts and fish from the Darklake.

	"The bottom rung in Gracklstugh society is mostly occupied by the underclass of the derro. Enslaved by the duergar centuries ago, then freed, the derro aren't allowed to hold honest jobs, and their rights are hardly ever recognized by the duergar. Even slaves are held in higher regard.

	"Another kind of outcasts are those duergar who dishonor their clans so grievously they are stripped of all but their lives: the {@i calassabrak}, meaning \"the flawed who aren't to be trusted\" in Dwarvish. They are shunned by other duergar, many eventually taking their lives rather than face an existence apart from family and clan.

The code of punishment is simple. Because dishonor, mutilation and imprisonment are a waste of resources and create weakness in society, a duergar who intentionally commits any crime receives a death sentence. Accidental crime by a duergar is compensated by goods or work equivalent to the damages.

	"The guard grudgingly lets the characters pass if the check succeeds, and refuses them entrance if it fails. If the check fails by 5 or more, the guard gives the order to arrest the characters, announcing that they are now slaves of the duergar (see \"Getting Captured\" below).": "如果检查成功，守卫会勉强让角色通过，如果检查失败则拒绝他们进入。如果检查的结果是5分或更多，警卫就会下令逮捕这些人物，宣布他们现在是duergar的奴隶（见下面的 \"被俘\"）。",
	"The first time the characters are allowed inside the city or turned away from a gate, a secret door on the wall opens, revealing Gorglak, a {@creature duergar Stone Guard|MTF} (see {@adventure appendix C|OotA|19}).": "人物第一次被允许进入城市或被拒之门外时，墙上的暗门会打开，露出高格拉克，一个（%0%）（见（%1%））。",

A successful DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check lets a character notice that Gorglak is eying the adventurers' weapons (especially any drow weapons or magic weapons they might have), and that there's something odd about his behavior. The madness creeping into Gracklstugh has made Gorglak obsessed with rare weapons. He's willing to go to great extents to acquire new weapons of exquisite design for his growing collection.": "如果他们和队伍在一起，{@creature Topsy|OotA}和{@creature Turvy|OotA}、{@creature Sarith Kzekarit|OotA}、{@creature Jimjar|OotA}和{@creature Buppido|OotA}可以悄悄告诉角色，很少有duergar像Gorglak这样公然腐败的。成功通过DC12智慧（（%5%））检查可以让角色注意到戈尔格拉克正在盯着冒险者的武器（尤其是他们可能拥有的任何鸦人武器或魔法武器），而且他的行为有些奇怪。匍匐在格拉克斯图的疯狂使戈尔格拉克对稀有武器着迷。他愿意不惜一切代价为自己不断增长的收藏品获取设计精美的新武器。",

Any other bribe requires one of the characters to succeed on a DC 13 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check, or Gorglak is insulted and has the party arrested. If the characters are too open about the negotiation, Gorglak has them arrested and pretends he didn't say anything.": "向戈尔格拉克提供一件值得收藏的武器，可以让这些角色通过大门。任何其他的贿赂都需要其中一个角色在DC13魅力({@skill Persuasion})检查中获得成功，否则高格拉克会被侮辱并逮捕他们。如果人物对谈判太过开放，戈尔格拉克就会逮捕他们，并假装他什么都没说。",
	"If Gorglak finds the characters' bribe appealing, he refuses to accept it then and there, instead directing them to find one Werz Saltbaron in the Darklake Docks and hand the bribe to him. Gorglak tells the characters that he will check with Werz at the end of his shift, and will find the characters and arrest them if they have not paid by then.": "如果Gorglak发现人物的贿赂很有吸引力，他拒绝当时就接受贿赂，而是指示他们在Darklake码头找到Werz Saltbaron并把贿赂交给他。Gorglak告诉这些人物，他将在下班时向Werz核实，如果他们到时还没有付款，他将找到这些人物并逮捕他们。",

	"As the characters draw closer, they can see that the eastern docks are the least crowded. If {@creature Buppido|OotA} is with them, he guides them to a natural rock pier on the eastern edge of the cavern. Otherwise, the characters must make a successful DC 14 group Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check or a DC 15 group Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check to guide their boat safely and inconspicuously to an empty dock. If the group check fails, nearby guards notice the characters but don't immediately identify them as a threat. However, you can choose to impose disadvantage on any checks the characters make to remain inconspicuous during their first day in Gracklstugh.": "随着人物的接近，他们可以看到东边的码头是最不拥挤的。如果{@creature Buppido|OotA}和他们在一起，他就会引导他们到洞穴东边的一个天然岩石码头。否则，角色们必须成功地进行DC14集体灵巧（（%%1%））检查或DC15集体智慧（（%%2%））检查，以引导他们的船安全而不显眼地到达一个空码头。如果团体检定失败，附近的守卫会注意到这些人物，但不会立即认定他们是一个威胁。然而，你可以选择对人物在Gracklstugh的第一天为保持不显眼而进行的任何检查施加不利条件。",
	"Even after making it inside the city, the characters must tread carefully, as the duergar use the slightest pretext to arrest them. Even trying to haggle with a duergar merchant might inspire a call for the guards to take the characters away. Getting caught stealing is punishable by death on the spot, but guards or the offended party might see some value in enslaving the culprits instead, so the characters can be shackled and shipped beyond the Darklake District. Resisting arrest is a truly bad idea; every duergar around is reinforcement.": "即使进了城，人物也必须小心翼翼，因为龙骑兵会用最轻微的借口来逮捕他们。即使是试图与杜尔加商人讨价还价，也可能会引起守卫的注意，让他们把人物带走。偷窃被抓会被当场处死，但守卫或被冒犯的一方可能会看到奴役罪犯的一些价值，所以人物可以被戴上镣铐，运到黑暗湖区以外。拒捕是一个非常糟糕的主意；周围的每一个杜尔加人都是援军。",
	"If the characters get arrested, you can interrupt their transfer with a random encounter or lead them to other planned encounters. The \"Rampaging Giant\" encounter (which takes place in the Darklake District) is the most likely event to interrupt a prisoner transfer. Alternatively, an agent of the Keepers of the Flame can stop the guards before they take the characters to Overlake Hold (see \"{@creature Themberchaud|OotA}'s Lair\" for information regarding the keepers' interest in foreign mercenaries).": "如果人物被捕，你可以用随机的遭遇来打断他们的转移，或者把他们引向其他计划的遭遇。横冲直撞的巨人 \"的遭遇（发生在黑暗湖区）是最有可能打断囚犯转移的事件。另外，火焰守卫者的代理人可以在守卫者将角色带到奥弗莱克城之前阻止他们（关于守卫者对外国雇佣兵的兴趣，请参见\"{@creature Themberchaud|OotA}的巢穴\"）。",

	"The Darklake District gives an illusion of openness. The streets are relatively wide to allow for merchant carts and wagons to pass, and the buildings aren't as crowded around stalagmites as in the southern districts. Openness doesn't mean welcoming, however. The duergar who ply their trades here are wary of all the foreigners confined by law to this part of the city.": "黑湖区给人一种开放的错觉。街道相对宽阔，可以让商车和马车通过，建筑物也不像南部地区那样挤在石笋周围。然而，开放并不意味着欢迎。在这里做生意的杜尔加人对所有被法律限制在城市的这一部分的外国人都很警惕。",
	"A wave of heat slams against you as an acrid smog rises to choke the air out of your lungs.

	"Behind the forbidding walls separating the Darklake District from the rest of the city stand the docks, markets, and shops where Gracklstugh's commerce and trade are conducted. The many duergar merchants—along with drow, svirfneblin, orcs, and others—pay little attention to the characters unless they are looking to do business.": "在将黑暗湖区与城市其他地方隔开的禁忌之墙后面，是码头、市场和商店，Gracklstugh的商业和贸易在这里进行。许多duergar商人--还有drow、svirfneblin、兽人和其他人--很少关注这些人物，除非他们想做生意。",

For gossip and a meal, the Shattered Spire tavern is recommended, while lodging for non-duergar can be had at the Ghohlbrorn's Lair inn.": "门口的守卫向人物明确表示，非精灵族人被限制在黑暗湖区，人物最好向其他外来者问路，而不是试图与精灵族当地人打交道。如果他们想出售他们可能携带的任何东西，他们会被引导到刀锋集市。如果要闲聊和吃饭，建议去 \"破碎尖塔 \"酒馆，而非龙人的住宿则可以在 \"戈尔布伦的巢穴 \"旅馆。",

	"This encounter triggers possible side quests through which the characters can learn about the influence of Demogorgon in Gracklstugh. You can use this event any time during the party's stay in the city. Holding it for later use gives characters a chance to notice the little things wrong among the duergar, while using it right away can help characters avoid being enslaved if they are arrested at any point during their visit.": "这个遭遇会触发可能的支线任务，通过这些任务，角色们可以了解德摩根在格拉克尔斯图的影响。你可以在队伍停留在这个城市的任何时候使用这个事件。将它留待以后使用，可以让人物有机会注意到德摩根之间的小问题，而立即使用它可以帮助人物在访问期间的任何时候被逮捕，避免被奴役。",
	"The rhythmic hammering of the city's forges is drowned for a second by a thundering roar and the sound of crumbling rock. Duergar and visitors alike turn to look as a two-headed, gray-skinned giant bursts through a gate, howling madly and lashing out left and right, littering the plaza with rock and stone debris. As he bellows, one of his swings connects with a duergar soldier, whose broken body flies through the air and crashes near you with a sickening crunch.": "城市锻造的有节奏的锤击声在一瞬间被雷鸣般的吼声和岩石崩裂的声音所淹没。杜尔加人和游客都转头看去，一个双头灰皮的巨人冲进了大门，疯狂地嚎叫着，左右开弓，在广场上到处都是岩石和石块碎片。随着他的嚎叫，他的一次挥舞击中了一名杜尔加士兵，他破碎的身体在空中飞翔，在你附近坠落，发出令人作呕的脆响。",

If the characters are prisoners under escort when the giant attacks, the guards who engage the giant are their escort.

Pelek doesn't know about the pygmywort mushrooms.": "当怪物被打败后，一个名叫佩莱克的深山地精的{@creature ghost}从地下探出头来，眨了眨眼，然后完全冒了出来。这个鬼魂很友好，他告诉冒险者，不久前{@creature Buppido|OotA}杀了他，然后把他切成碎片，和其他身体部分一起放在神龛里。佩莱克解释了他是如何从布林登斯通出发，与{@creature Buppido|OotA}坠入的。他对沃尔斯通隧道知之甚少，但他曾观察到一个戴着滑稽帽子的缩小版德鲁人（（%%3%））进出狭窄的隧道。佩莱克不知道侏儒草蘑菇的事。",
	"Pelek asks the characters to take one or more parts of him to Blingdenstone and bury his remains there, so that his spirit can rest. It's impossible to tell which body parts are his, and looking around is a gruesome task that speaks loudly to {@creature Buppido|OotA}'s madness. Pelek recalls that the strange magic that pervades the tunnels animated one of his severed hands, and it scuttled away through one of the narrow tunnels. (Characters might encounter it in area 13.) Pelek points out that characters can recognize the hand because it was wearing an obsidian ring. If the characters need more reasons to go to Blingdenstone, Pelek adds that the svirfneblin who live there know many ways to the surface.": "Pelek要求人物把他的一个或多个部分带到Blingdenstone，把他的遗体埋在那里，让他的精神得到安息。不可能分辨出哪些身体部位是他的，四处寻找是一项可怕的任务，大声说出了（%0%）的疯狂。佩莱克回忆说，弥漫在隧道中的奇怪的魔法使他的一只断手变得生动起来，它在一条狭窄的隧道中窜走了。(角色可能会在13区遇到它。）Pelek指出，角色可以认出这只手，因为它戴着一个黑曜石戒指。如果角色需要更多的理由去Blingdenstone，Pelek补充说，住在那里的svirfneblin知道许多通往地面的方法。",

The river carries many things from the subterranean lake, including the carcasses of countless creatures, fouling the pool (see the \"Whorlstone Tunnels: General Features\" sidebar).": "这个池子由一条从黑暗湖流来的河流提供水源。这条河从地下湖携带了许多东西，包括无数生物的尸体，弄脏了水池（见 \"霍尔石隧道：一般特征 \"侧边栏）。",

Gnomes are immune.": "水是由温泉加热的，温暖宜人。然而，这个池子里充满了疾病。任何在水中开始的生物都必须做一个DC13的宪法救赎动作。如果拯救失败，该生物就会被感染上咯咯热（见《(1%)》第8章的\"{@book Diseases|DMG|8|Diseases}\"）。地精是免疫的。",

Climbing the slippery walls of the cavern requires a successful DC 13 {@skill Athletics} check. On a failed check, a character falls into the water.": "人物可以尝试在不游泳的情况下绕过水池，通过使用魔法或沿着墙壁爬行。攀爬洞穴中湿滑的墙壁需要成功进行DC13（%0%）的检查。如果检查失败，角色就会掉入水中。",

	"The tunnel opens into a natural cave, wherein you see several fungal creatures dancing to a silent tune. Three of them stand five feet tall, while the others are half as tall.

	"If the characters try to communicate with the myconids, they release rapport spores so that everyone can speak telepathically. The leader of the myconids is an adult named Voosbur, who speaks on behalf of the others. Sharing thoughts with these sentient mushrooms is an odd and strangely intoxicating experience (and feels quite different than the rapport the characters might have shared with {@creature Stool|OotA}). Voosbur happily tells the party how its \"troupe\" was attracted by the special mushrooms in these tunnels, and it tells the characters about the magical properties of the pygmywort and bigwig mushrooms. Voosbur further explains that the myconids didn't wander into this area, but arrived here by traveling \"through the Lady's dream.\" Voosbur describes \"the Lady\" as a powerful being that loves and guides all myconids. He offers to share \"the Lady's gift\" with the characters, allowing them to travel \"through the Lady's dream\" as the myconids do. Characters who accept the offer gain Zuggtmoy's gift (see the sidebar).": "如果角色们试图与菌类沟通，它们就会释放出默契的孢子，从而使每个人都能用心灵感应说话。菌类的领袖是一个名叫沃斯伯的成年人，他代表其他人说话。与这些有知觉的蘑菇分享思想是一种奇怪的、令人陶醉的体验（感觉与人物可能与{@creature Stool|OotA}分享的融洽关系完全不同）。Voosbur高兴地告诉大家，它的 \"剧团 \"是如何被这些隧道中的特殊蘑菇所吸引的，它还告诉大家侏儒草和大头菜蘑菇的神奇特性。Voosbur进一步解释说，这些菌类并没有游荡到这个区域，而是通过 \"穿越女士的梦境 \"到达这里。沃斯伯将 \"女士 \"描述为一个强大的存在，她爱并引导所有的菌类。他提议与人物分享 \"女士的礼物\"，允许他们像菌类一样 \"通过女士的梦境 \"旅行。接受这个提议的角色会获得Zuggtmoy的礼物（见侧边栏）。",
	"If present, {@creature Stool|OotA} tells the characters it has no idea what Voosbur is talking about.

	"{@creature Rumpadump|OotA} is as introverted as {@creature Stool|OotA} is outgoing, preferring to hang back and not use its rapport spores unless absolutely necessary. Whether {@creature Stool|OotA} is present or not, {@creature Rumpadump|OotA} can guide the characters to Neverlight Grove (see {@adventure chapter 5|OotA|4}), where the sovereigns might know of a way out of the Underdark. However, the myconid sprout is worried that Voosbur's \"strange spores\" might have infected the rest of the myconids back home.": "{@creature Rumpadump|OotA}和{@creature Stool|OotA}一样内向，喜欢呆在后面，不到万不得已不使用它的关系孢子。无论{@creature Stool|OotA}是否在场，{@creature Rumpadump|OotA}都可以引导人物到永光丛林（见{@adventure chapter 5|OotA|4}），那里的君主可能知道离开地下世界的方法。然而，霉菌萌芽担心沃斯伯的 \"奇怪的孢子 \"可能已经感染了家乡的其他霉菌。",
	"Voosbur takes no offense if the characters refuse his offer to teach them how to travel \"the Lady's dream,\" simply bidding them farewell as the myconids resume their dancing. If the characters have shown {@creature Rumpadump|OotA} any kindness, it asks their permission to join the party, especially if {@creature Stool|OotA} is present. At the same time, Sarith breaks away from the party to join the myconids. The drow turns one last time to give the characters a look of terror and despair before his face loses all expression. He and the dancing myconids then enter a mushroom patch and use the {@spell tree stride} ability granted by Zuggtmoy's blessing to vanish from sight.": "如果人物拒绝他教他们如何旅行 \"女士的梦想 \"的提议，Voosbur不会介意，只是在菌类继续跳舞时向他们告别。如果人物对{@creature Rumpadump|OotA}有任何善意，它就会请求他们允许加入聚会，尤其是在{@creature Stool|OotA}在场的情况下。与此同时，萨利斯脱离了队伍，加入了菌类的行列。乌鸦最后一次转身，在他的脸上失去所有的表情之前，给了角色们一个恐怖和绝望的表情。然后他和跳舞的菌类进入一片蘑菇地，并使用祖格莫伊的祝福所赋予的（%2%）能力，从人们的视线中消失。",

	"Although creepy, the hissing sound is harmless, caused by air whistling through perforated mushrooms in the thicket of fungi. The characters can cross this area by forcing their way through it, or by eating pygmywort mushrooms first to move through without disturbing the other fungi present. If the characters are chasing {@creature Droki|OotA}, he uses the thicket to his advantage, eating a pygmywort to sneak his way across. At reduced size, he leaves no trail that normal-sized pursuers can follow.": "虽然令人毛骨悚然，但这种嘶嘶声是无害的，是空气呼啸着穿过真菌丛中的穿孔蘑菇造成的。角色可以通过强行穿越这个区域，或者先吃侏儒草菇，在不干扰其他在场的真菌的情况下通过。如果人物被追赶（%0%），他就会利用丛生的优势，吃下一个侏儒草来偷偷地穿过。在体型缩小的情况下，他不会留下正常体型的追捕者可以跟踪的痕迹。",

	"Many of the myconids in the grove are more extroverted than might be expected of their normally shy species. Characters who communicate with the myconids by way of their rapport spores note that the creatures seem to be preparing for a celebration of some sort, proclaiming \"The day of joy is nigh!\" and exhorting others to \"Rejoice in the true union that will meld us all!\" These are the myconids affected by Zuggtmoy, and their behavior is cause for concern among the unaffected, including {@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA} and its allies.": "丛林中的许多霉菌类动物都比通常情况下的害羞物种要外向得多。通过默契孢子与菌类沟通的角色注意到，这些生物似乎正在准备某种庆祝活动，它们宣称 \"欢乐的日子近了！\"并劝告其他人 \"为将我们所有人融合在一起的真正结合而欢呼！\" 这些是受Zuggtmoy影响的菌类，它们的行为引起了未受影响者的关注，包括{@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA}和它的盟友。",
	"Myconid communities normally have only a single sovereign—the largest among them, who stands alone and outside of any circle (see below). Two years ago, {@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA} arrived in the grove with its two circles, and Sovereign Phylo welcomed the new myconids gladly, grateful for Basidia's offer to share the burdens of leading all the circles in the grove. The two sovereigns have been close friends ever since, sharing authority and responsibilities with no conflict. Each knows that an individual myconid has only so much time in the cycle of life, and that when both have passed, a single sovereign will take their place after their bodies are returned to nourish the soil.": "霉菌社区通常只有一个君主--他们中最大的君主，他独自站在任何圈子之外（见下文）。两年前，{@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA}带着它的两个圈子来到了小树林，主权者Phylo高兴地欢迎新的菌类，感谢Basidia提出分担领导小树林所有圈子的重任。从那时起，两位君主一直是亲密的朋友，分享权力和责任，没有冲突。每个人都知道，在生命的轮回中，一个单独的霉菌只有这么多时间，当两个人都去世后，在他们的身体回到土壤中滋养后，会有一个君主来取代他们。",
	"The circles in Neverlight Grove are divided by specialized function, with each circle performing a specific role in the colony. Seven circles are present in the grove, each containing an average of twenty myconids—the Circle of Hunters, the Circle of Explorers, the Circle of Sowers, the Circle of Builders, the Circle of Growers, plus the recently formed Inner Circle and Circle of Masters. Each circle gathers around a circle mound—a pile of rocks and soil upon which mold, lichen, and mushrooms are encouraged to grow. The myconids of a circle gather around their own mound to meld and sleep.": "永恒之光丛林中的圈子是按专门的功能划分的，每个圈子都在殖民地中发挥着特定的作用。小树林里有七个圈子，每个圈子平均有20个菌类--猎人圈子、探索者圈子、播种者圈子、建设者圈子、种植者圈子，加上最近形成的内部圈子和大师圈子。每个圈子都聚集在一个圈子的土堆周围--一堆岩石和土壤，鼓励霉菌、地衣和蘑菇在上面生长。一个圈子的菌类聚集在他们自己的圆丘周围，进行融合和睡眠。",
	"After becoming enthralled by Zuggtmoy, Phylo decided the myconids would meld exclusively within their own circle, and only the circle leaders would meld with the other circle leaders and the sovereigns. Phylo asserted that this would make all the circles' meldings far more efficient, thereby making the tending of the grove that much easier. Most of the grove's myconids have gone along with this new and unusual concept, swayed by Phylo's claims that a higher level of communal harmony will be achieved.": "在被Zuggtmoy迷住之后，Phylo决定，菌类将只在自己的圈子里融合，只有圈子的领导者才会与其他圈子的领导者和君主融合。菲洛断言，这将使所有圈子的融合更加有效，从而使小树林的管理更加容易。丛林中的大多数菌类都接受了这个新的、不寻常的概念，被菲洛声称将实现更高水平的社区和谐所动摇。",
	"Basidia believes that Phylo's separation of the circles is contrary to the unity and harmony of the myconid way of life, and that this segregation isolates individuals from the experiences of others outside their circle. Basidia has likewise expressed concern about the unnaturalness of the Inner Circle and the Circle of Masters. However, Basidia's views are either dismissed or ignored by Phylo and its allies, who zealously claim that exciting changes are coming for the grove.": "Basidia认为，Phylo对圈子的分离违背了菌类生活方式的统一性和和谐性，这种隔离使个人与他们圈子以外的其他人的经验相隔离。Basidia也同样对 \"内部圈子 \"和 \"大师圈子 \"的不自然性表示担忧。然而，Basidia的观点要么被Phylo及其盟友驳回，要么被他们忽视，他们热衷于宣称丛林即将发生激动人心的变化。",
	"A more recent development has Basidia even more disturbed when the adventurers arrive in Neverlight Grove. {@creature Yestabrod|OotA}, the leader of the Circle of Masters, has not attended an Inner Circle melding for several days now, instead sending a representative (see \"The Circle of Masters\" in area 5). Times in Neverlight Grove are strange and worrisome indeed.": "当冒险者们到达永光丛林时，一个更近的发展让巴西迪亚更加不安了。{@creature Yestabrod|OotA}，大师圈的领袖，已经好几天没有参加内圈的融合了，而是派了一个代表（见第五区的 \"大师圈\"）。永光丛林的时代确实很奇怪，也很令人担忧。",
	"Myconids lead lives completely unlike the experiences of any surface dweller. The only things they have in common with humanoids are the need for sustenance, the desire to live, and the joy of socialization, although they practice each of these things in different ways than humanoids. Truly alien creatures, myconids have difficulty telling flesh-and-blood humanoids apart.": "菌类所过的生活与任何地面居民的经历完全不同。他们与人类的唯一共同点是对食物的需求，对生活的渴望，以及社交的乐趣，尽管他们以不同于人类的方式实践这些事情。作为真正的外星生物，菌类很难区分有血有肉的类人。",
	"Myconids are innocent about matters of ethics and morality, their lives centered on living fully each day and worrying little about the future and nothing at all about the past. Despite the communal nature of their existence, they are individuals with their own unique interests and distinct personalities. They gravitate toward simple, shared joys, living by the wisdom and insight their melding provides. Because of their naive and sharing ways, as well as their fungal nature, they are extremely vulnerable to the corrupting influence of Zuggtmoy.": "霉菌在伦理和道德问题上是无辜的，他们的生活中心是充分地过好每一天，对未来很少担心，对过去根本不担心。尽管他们的存在具有公共性，但他们是有自己独特兴趣和独特个性的个体。他们倾向于简单的、共享的快乐，靠他们的融合提供的智慧和洞察力生活。由于他们的天真和分享方式，以及他们的真菌性质，他们非常容易受到Zuggtmoy的腐蚀影响。",
	"The myconids of Neverlight Grove are beginning to reel from the Lady of Decay's influence, with many blissfully welcoming her madness, while others bravely try to resist it. Myconids affected by Zuggtmoy abandon the growth of life as the core of their being in favor of decay and death. More horrifying is that they do so with childlike innocence, reveling in the corruption of all life with a sense of wonder and joy, unable to grasp the evil they have embraced.": "梦幻树丛的菌类开始受到腐烂女士的影响，许多人幸福地欢迎她的疯狂，而其他人则勇敢地试图抵制它。受Zuggtmoy影响的菌类放弃了作为其存在核心的生命成长，而选择了腐烂和死亡。更可怕的是，他们在这样做的时候还带着孩子般的天真，以一种好奇和喜悦的心情陶醉于所有生命的腐败，无法理解他们所拥抱的邪恶。",
	"Myconids share everything through melding. Rapport spores carry a tiny bit of all myconids to the other myconids in their circle, to be absorbed and reside within them, and creating a telepathic familial bond. When the myconids of a circle gather to meld, they share their individual insights, fears, hopes, and dreams. Through the melding, all myconids join together to form the heart and soul of a colony.": "霉菌类通过融合分享一切。和谐孢子将所有霉菌的一小部分带到他们圈子里的其他霉菌身上，被他们吸收并居住在其中，并创造一种心灵感应的家庭纽带。当一个圈子的霉菌聚集在一起进行融合时，他们会分享各自的见解、恐惧、希望和梦想。通过融合，所有的菌类都结合在一起，形成一个菌群的核心和灵魂。",
	"Initially weakened by the summoning ritual that wrenched her from the Abyss, Zuggtmoy found her way to Neverlight Grove, drawn by the strength of its fungal vitality. Upon her arrival, she quickly assessed the situation, realizing the shortest path to gain control of the grove would be to sway and corrupt its original sovereign to serve her until she recovered her strength.": "扎格莫伊最初被从深渊中召唤出来的仪式所削弱，她被永光丛林的真菌活力所吸引，找到了自己的道路。到达后，她迅速评估了情况，意识到获得丛林控制权的最短途径是动摇和腐蚀它原来的统治者，使其为她服务，直到她恢复力量。",
	"After being welcomed to the grove by Phylo, Zuggtmoy melded with the sovereign in secret, seducing it with the promise of a paradise for the mushroom folk if Phylo would lead them to become her followers on the Material Plane. Its mind completely lost inside the demon queen's insidiously mad vision, Phylo became enthralled by the promise of plentiful soil and moisture, perpetual rot, and beautiful transcendent dreams to be shared in a never-ending communal melding—all offered to the grove's folk as generous and wondrous gifts from the Lady of Decay.": "在受到菲洛的欢迎后，祖格莫伊秘密地与君主融合在一起，诱惑它承诺如果菲洛能带领他们成为她在物质世界的追随者，就能为蘑菇族提供一个天堂。Phylo完全迷失在恶魔女王阴险疯狂的视野中，它被丰富的土壤和水分、永久的腐烂和美丽的超凡梦想的承诺所迷惑，在一个永无止境的集体融合中分享这些东西--所有这些都是腐烂女士慷慨而奇妙的礼物，提供给丛林的人们的。",
	"Everyday melding has now become a subtle ideological war between supporters of the two myconid sovereigns. Phylo is slowly convincing the mushroom folk to follow the new path. Basidia and its dwindling supporters argue against the new way, even as they lose ground (and allies) each time the circles of the grove share consciousness.": "日常的融合现在已经成为两个菌类主权支持者之间微妙的意识形态战争。Phylo正在慢慢地说服蘑菇族人遵循新的道路。Basidia和它不断减少的支持者们则反对新的道路，甚至在每次小树林的圈子分享意识时，他们都会失去阵地（和盟友）。",
	"As more and more myconids unwittingly become vessels for Zuggtmoy's spores, Neverlight Grove becomes a more extravagantly festive place. The quiet, contemplative joy of the mushroom folk's way of life is being inexorably replaced by decadent, enraptured euphoria—and the madness that euphoria hides.": "随着越来越多的菌类不知不觉地成为Zuggtmoy孢子的容器，Neverlight Grove变成了一个更加奢侈的节日场所。蘑菇民的生活方式的安静、沉思的快乐正不可避免地被颓废、陶醉的欣快感所取代，以及欣快感所隐藏的疯狂。",

	"Upon her arrival in the Underdark, Zuggtmoy found Neverlight Grove and took up residence there. The myconids welcomed her, sealing their fate. Through telepathically shared dreams, corruption has taken root deep within the colony, warping the myconids' normally placid and peaceful nature into something restive and rapturous.

While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success.

With each step taken on the soggy ground, a rank scent of decay rises around you.": "淡奶油色和米色的茎秆长得又粗又高，类似于表面世界的森林。真菌到处生长，在它们之间很难找到类似于道路的东西。巨大的紫檀木蘑菇帽遮住了你对洞穴天花板的视线，但那里的发光真菌散发出闪亮的光环。在潮湿的地面上每走一步，你周围就会升起一股腐烂的气味。",

Loobamub redirects the spore servants and awakened zurkhwoods Phylo creates away from its circle's territory.": "作为猎人的圈子领袖，这个高大精干的菌人与巴西迪亚一样，对菲洛的新方式感到担忧，尽管它在加入内部圈子时仍有能力抵制菲洛的腐化融合。Loobamub对自己的意见保持沉默，但当其他猎人融合时，它的戒心会蔓延到其他猎人身上，巩固他们对Basidia的忠诚。Loobamub将Phylo创造的孢子仆人和被唤醒的Zurkhwoods从它的圈子的领土上重新定向。",
	"Loobamub is happy to enlist the party's aid in dealing with a few unwelcome monsters that have found their way into the fungal wilds. In particular, the circle leader asks the adventurers to kill a {@creature grick alpha} and then take its carcass to Basidia for reanimation.

	"If Gasbide interacts with the characters using rapport spores, it demands descriptions of surface-world structures, bristling with an excitement seldom seen in myconids. It asks for exasperatingly minor details such as the precise dimensions of bricks or the density of lumber. Gasbide reveals through the rapport that it dreams of building a fungal tower \"even greater than Yggmorgus.\" It hopes to break through the Underdark to the surface world, possibly \"with the aid of Araumycos.\" Gasbide has no conscious knowledge of what Araumycos is, sensing only that it is part of the great celebration to come.

	"The circle mound of the growers is on the top terrace, near the cavern wall. The growers are the colony's farmers, ensuring the soil beneath the pools remains fertile and tending the fungi there.": "种植者的圆丘在顶层平台上，靠近洞壁。种植者是殖民地的农民，确保水池下面的土壤保持肥沃，并照料那里的真菌。",
	"The leader of the growers doesn't care much for Phylo's new ideas. But though it misses mass meldings, Hebopbe doesn't see Basidia's protests as worthy of concern.

	"This depression in the cavern floor is the main part of the myconid colony. The central circle mound was only recently created, and is now a kind of \"town square\" where all the grove's myconids gather for mass meldings. These have become rare, however, reserved for when Phylo wants to stoke the myconids' enthusiasm for the celebration that only those infected by Zuggtmoy know about. This leaves the uninfected confused but happy that something joyous is about to happen.": "洞底的这个洼地是菌类聚居地的主要部分。中央的圆丘是最近才创建的，现在是一种 \"城市广场\"，丛林中所有的霉菌都聚集在这里进行大规模的融合。然而，这已经变得很罕见了，只保留在菲洛想激起菌类对庆祝活动的热情时，只有那些被Zuggtmoy感染的人知道。这让未受感染的人感到困惑，但又为即将发生的快乐的事情感到高兴。",
	"Beyond the mud and mushrooms that spread across the cavern, a large, clear pool sits in the midst of the fungal grove. A central mound seems to be the only dry spot in sight, though a small cliff rises above the cavern floor far across the clearing, with giant mushrooms visible in the distance. Bioluminescent fungi trace strange constellations along the cavern's ceiling and walls, showing the darkness of the ravine and a mist-shrouded smaller cavern beyond.": "在遍布洞穴的泥浆和蘑菇之外，一个巨大而清澈的水池坐落在真菌丛林的中间。一个中央小丘似乎是眼前唯一干燥的地方，尽管一个小悬崖在空地上远远地耸立在洞底，远处可见巨大的蘑菇。生物发光的真菌沿着洞穴的天花板和墙壁描画出奇怪的星座，显示出峡谷的黑暗和外面雾气笼罩的小洞穴。",
	"The central mound is the base of the colony's two {@creature Myconid Sovereign||myconid sovereigns}, Phylo and Basidia.

	"Phylo invites the characters to stay as long as they wish, inviting them to explore and enjoy the many delights of Neverlight Grove. He politely asks that they avoid the eastern plateau because the Circle of Masters is preparing \"a wondrous and glorious surprise\" in the Garden of Welcome. Phylo offers to give them a peek the next day if they want. If Sarith is with the characters, he suggests they accept this offer, saying that keeping on the sovereign's good side will help the party in the long term. In truth, he is attempting to deliver the adventurers to Zuggtmoy.": "菲洛邀请这些人物在此停留，只要他们愿意，请他们探索并享受永光丛林的诸多乐趣。他礼貌地要求他们避开东部的高原，因为大师们正在欢迎花园准备 \"一个奇妙而光荣的惊喜\"。菲洛提出，如果他们愿意的话，可以在第二天让他们看一看。如果萨利斯和这些人物在一起，他建议他们接受这个提议，并说保持与君主的良好关系将长期帮助他们。事实上，他是想把冒险者们送到扎格莫伊那里。",
	"Phylo goes on about how \"the Great Seeder\" who lives beyond the garden can answer any questions they have. The sovereign describes this entity in favorable terms, using \"she\" and \"her\" as it does so. Because myconids have no concept of gender, this unusual speech is further indication of Phylo's madness. However, the sovereign dodges any question about who the Great Seeder actually is, saying it is important for the characters to experience her first hand.": "Phylo继续说，住在花园外的 \"伟大的播种者 \"可以回答他们的任何问题。主权者用有利的术语描述了这个实体，在描述时使用了 \"她 \"和 \"她\"。因为菌类没有性别的概念，这种不寻常的说话方式进一步表明了菲洛的疯狂。然而，君主回避了任何关于大播种者究竟是谁的问题，他说重要的是让人物亲身体验她。",
	"A successful DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check reveals that {@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA} is uncomfortable with Phylo's behavior. {@creature Stool|OotA} and {@creature Rumpadump|OotA} can easily discern that the harmony between Phylo and Basidia is off. At the earliest opportunity, Basidia volunteers to show the characters around, or finds another opportunity to rapport with them privately.": "成功的DC12智慧（（%0%））检查显示，（%1%）对Phylo的行为感到不舒服。{@creature Stool|OotA}和{@creature Rumpadump|OotA}可以很容易地看出Phylo和Basidia之间的和谐是不正常的。在最早的机会，Basidia自愿带着这些人物参观，或者找到另一个机会与他们私下融洽相处。",
	"When alone with the characters, Basidia warns them about staying in Neverlight Grove too long. It tells them another group of \"softers\" (the name myconids use for fleshy creatures) arrived not too many cycles ago and accepted Phylo's offer. They were taken to the Garden of Welcome and Basidia hasn't seen them since, nor has Phylo made any further mention of them (see \"Questions for the Sovereigns\"). Basidia also tells the characters that the Circle of Masters is taking most of the carcasses the Circle of Hunters bring in, and are sending groups of myconids outside the grove without telling anybody.": "当与这些人物单独在一起时，Basidia警告他们不要在Neverlight Grove呆得太久。它告诉他们，另一群 \"软体人\"（菌类对肉体生物的称呼）在不久前来到这里，接受了菲洛的提议。他们被带到了欢迎花园，此后Basidia再也没有见过他们，Phylo也没有再提过他们（见 \"对统治者的疑问\"）。Basidia还告诉角色们，\"大师圈 \"拿走了 \"猎人圈 \"带来的大部分尸体，并在不告诉任何人的情况下把一群群的菌类送到丛林外。",
	"If Basidia rapports with Sarith or any other non-myconid infected with Zuggtmoy's spores, it senses the alien nature of the demon lord's corruption. It can't identify Zuggtmoy's spores, but knows only that it has not encountered them before. This is unusual, Basidia tells the party, since most myconid sovereigns recognize all spores produced by myconids throughout the Underdark.": "如果Basidia与Sarith或任何其他感染了Zuggtmoy孢子的非真菌类动物建立了联系，它就会感觉到恶魔领主的腐败的异类性质。它无法识别扎格莫伊的孢子，只知道它以前没有遇到过它们。这很不寻常，巴西迪亚告诉大家，因为大多数霉菌君主都能认出整个暗黑世界的所有霉菌产生的孢子。",
	"If the characters ask the sovereigns to help them return to the surface world, both are apologetic that they know of no routes. However, Basidia notes that during its colony's migration, the many travelers from the surface world they encountered were mostly merchants on their way to or from Blingdenstone, Gracklstugh, or Menzoberranzan.": "如果人物要求君主帮助他们返回地表世界，两人都很抱歉地表示他们不知道任何路线。然而，Basidia指出，在其殖民地的迁移过程中，他们遇到的许多来自地表世界的旅行者大多是来往于Blingdenstone、Gracklstugh或Menzoberranzan的商人。",
	"If the adventurers ask the sovereigns about any drow in the area, Basidia tells them about a drow patrol that just recently arrived. However, Phylo immediately interrupts, telling the characters that the drow were here a few days ago, but left shortly after Phylo showed them the Garden of Welcome. A successful DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check reveals that Basidia seems puzzled by Phylo's answer. If pressed, Basidia simply says it didn't know the drow had already left.": "如果冒险者们向君主们询问该地区是否有乌鸦，巴西迪亚会告诉他们最近刚到的一支乌鸦巡逻队。然而，菲洛立刻打断了他们，告诉他们这些乌鸦几天前还在这里，但在菲洛带他们看完欢迎花园后不久就离开了。成功通过DC12智慧（（%0%））检查后，发现巴西迪亚似乎对菲洛的回答感到疑惑。如果被逼问，巴西迪亚只是说它不知道乌鸦已经离开了。",
	"Basidia offers to give the party a guided tour of all the circles in areas 1 through 4, where it introduces them to the respective circle leaders, pointing out which leaders support it, and which ones support Sovereign Phylo. Basidia uses this time away from Phylo to express its fear that Phylo has contracted some sort of \"diseased spore.\" Basidia thinks that a clue to the spore's nature might be found in the Garden of Welcome. Basidia asks the characters to investigate the garden, fearing to do so itself in case it also falls victim to Phylo's disease.": "Basidia提出要带着党员参观1到4区的所有圈子，在那里向他们介绍各自的圈子领袖，指出哪些领袖支持它，哪些支持Sovereign Phylo。Basidia利用这段远离Phylo的时间，表达了它对Phylo感染了某种 \"患病孢子 \"的担心。Basidia认为，在欢迎花园中可能会发现关于孢子性质的线索。Basidia要求角色们调查这个花园，但又害怕自己这样做，以防它也成为Phylo疾病的受害者。",
	"As a sign of friendship, Basidia gives the characters a moldy scroll case containing a {@item scroll of protection} against fiends. Basidia promises an additional reward (see \"Treasure\") if the characters investigate the Garden of Welcome on its behalf. Basidia can also brew potions out of the different molds and fungi in the grove, storing them in hollow gourd-like mushrooms. Basidia can craft a common or uncommon potion in eight hours, or a rare potion in two days.": "作为友谊的象征，Basidia给了人物一个发霉的卷轴箱，里面有一个对抗恶魔的（%0%）。Basidia承诺，如果人物代表它调查欢迎花园，还会有额外的奖励（见 \"宝藏\"）。Basidia还可以用小树林中不同的霉菌和真菌来酿造药水，将它们储存在空心葫芦状的蘑菇中。Basidia可以在八小时内制作出普通或不普通的药水，或者在两天内制作出稀有药水。",
	"If the characters complete Basidia's quest, the myconid sovereign digs up a small box buried in the earth and gives it to them. The box contains curiosities Basidia has collected from dead travelers over the years. The box is unlocked, made of fine wood inlaid with silver, and worth 25 gp by itself. It contains three amethysts (100 gp each), four small diamonds (50 gp each), and one large diamond (500 gp).": "如果角色们完成了巴西迪亚的任务，霉菌君主就会挖出一个埋在土里的小盒子，并把它交给他们。盒子里装着Basidia多年来从死去的旅行者那里收集的奇珍异宝。盒子没有上锁，由镶嵌着银子的上等木头制成，本身就价值25金币。里面有三颗紫水晶（每颗100金币），四颗小钻石（每颗50金币），和一颗大钻石（500金币）。",
	"If the characters kill the grick alpha, the umber hulk, or the shambling mound in the Fungal Wilds and bring the carcasses to Basidia, the sovereign rewards each character with a {@item potion of greater healing} stored in a hollow gourd-like mushroom.": "如果角色们在真菌荒野中杀死了格里克-阿尔法、黄褐色绿巨人或晃动的土丘，并将尸体带到巴西迪亚，君主会奖励每个角色一个（%0%），储存在一个空心葫芦状的蘑菇中。",
	"This circle mound is devoted to sporing new myconids. Freshly spored myconids are only a few inches tall and have no awareness, but they grow quickly into myconid sprouts.": "这个圆丘专门用来孢子新菌种。新生的孢子菌只有几英寸高，没有意识，但它们很快就会长成孢子菌的芽。",
	"The circle leader is infected by Zuggtmoy's madness. It is always swaying to music only it can hear, but those in rapport with Yrberop can hear a faint echo of its internal cacophony. Yrberop is enthusiastic about Phylo's plan to spread the happiness brought by the Great Seeder to everyone in the Underdark and beyond. For that to happen, the colony needs many more sprouts.": "圈子里的领袖被Zuggtmoy的疯狂所感染。它总是在只有它能听到的音乐中摇摆，但那些与Yrberop关系融洽的人可以听到它内部的微弱回声。Yrberop热衷于Phylo的计划，即把伟大的播种者带来的快乐传播给暗黑世界和其他地方的每个人。为了实现这一目标，殖民地需要更多的萌芽。",
	"If the characters confer with Basidia, {@creature Stool|OotA}, or {@creature Rumpadump|OotA}, these myconids tell them this push to expand the population is unusual, given the balance that the myconids have endeavored to maintain in Neverlight Grove for so long.": "如果人物与Basidia、{@creature Stool|OotA}或{@creature Rumpadump|OotA}商议，这些菌类就会告诉他们，鉴于菌类长期以来努力在Neverlight Grove维持的平衡，这种扩大人口的推动是不寻常的。",
	"Yrberop loses track of any conversation after a short while and begins talking to the newly spored myconids instead. Characters who communicate with Yrberop in rapport and succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check can make out some of the words and impressions in the circle leader's lullaby. It sings of the Great Seeder and \"her\" wedding to the Great Body, and how every myconid is invited, bringing joy to all in the world below and above.": "Yrberop在很短的时间内就失去了任何对话的踪迹，转而开始与新宠的菌类交谈。与Yrberop默契地交流，并在DC13智慧（（%0%））检查中成功的角色可以听出圈子领袖的摇篮曲中的一些话和印象。它唱的是伟大的播种者和 \"她 \"与伟大的身体的婚礼，以及每一个菌类是如何被邀请的，给下面和上面的世界带来欢乐。",
	"Behind the myconid breeding grounds is a narrow path leading up to a plateau and the Garden of Welcome (area 5).

	"This circle leader is loyal to Basidia. Frequent trips outside the grove have allowed Rasharoo to notice the changes in Phylo and the entire colony more sharply, and it now trusts nothing and no one except Basidia. Its paranoia isn't the product of Zuggtmoy's corruption, however, but of the rising madness gripping the Underdark from the intrusion of the demon lords. If the characters demonstrate sympathy with Basidia or if the sovereign is with them, Rasharoo discloses it has a few escape plans ready, and has nutrient caches hidden along exit tunnels in case Basidia decides it is better to abandon the grove and return to a nomadic lifestyle.": "这个圈子的领导者对巴西迪亚很忠诚。经常到小树林以外的地方去，让Rasharoo更敏锐地注意到Phylo和整个殖民地的变化，它现在除了Basidia之外，什么都不相信，也不相信任何人。然而，它的偏执并不是Zuggtmoy腐败的产物，而是由于恶魔领主的入侵而使暗黑世界的疯狂程度上升。如果人物表现出对巴西迪亚的同情，或者君主和他们在一起，拉沙鲁就会透露它已经准备好了一些逃跑计划，并在出口通道上藏有营养品，以防巴西迪亚决定放弃丛林，回到游牧生活中去。",
	"Characters can climb the eastern corner of the top terrace to reach area 5, and Rasharoo gladly helps them if they head to the Garden of Welcome at Basidia's request.": "角色们可以爬上顶层露台的东边一角到达5号区域，如果他们应Basidia的要求前往欢迎花园，Rasharoo很乐意帮助他们。",
	"Among the myconids, Rasharoo and its circle are the adventurers' best hope of finding a way back to the surface. Rasharoo knows many promising paths, but since myconids have no interest in the sunlit world, it has never followed them all the way there. The circle leader helps the characters only after they complete Basidia's quest, assigning one of its explorers to guide the characters to their destination.": "在菌类中，Rasharoo和它的圈子是冒险家们找到返回地面的最好希望。拉沙鲁知道许多有希望的道路，但由于菌类对阳光世界没有兴趣，它从来没有一直跟随他们到那里。圈子领袖只有在人物完成巴西迪亚的任务后才会帮助他们，指派它的一个探险家来引导人物到达目的地。",
	"Phylo has converted this unused terrace for the exciting new ideas that Zuggtmoy has inspired in it—ideas that are \"too incredible\" for the rest of the colony to absorb at once. This so-called garden is just a sample of the horrors that Zuggtmoy, the Demon Queen of Fungi, intends to bring to the Underdark.": "菲洛将这个闲置的露台改造成Zuggtmoy在其中激发的令人兴奋的新想法--这些想法 \"太不可思议了\"，殖民地的其他成员无法一下子吸收。这个所谓的花园只是Zuggtmoy，真菌的恶魔女王，打算带给地下世界的恐怖的一个样本。",
	"This plateau rises higher than the other terraces, screened by a natural fence of soaring zurkhwood stalks. Muffled murmuring can be heard from atop the plateau.": "这片高原比其他梯田高，被高耸的紫檀树杆组成的天然栅栏挡住。从高原上可以听到低沉的杂音。",
	"The newest circle in the colony, the Circle of Masters is formed exclusively by myconids touched by Zuggtmoy. These myconids share Phylo's vision of happiness spread through Zuggtmoy's spores, experimenting on the carcasses brought to them by the hunters—or on live prisoners they hunt in their own expeditions outside the grove. Their mound lies at the center of an obscene garden.": "殖民地的最新圈子，\"大师之圈 \"是由被Zuggtmoy触动的菌类专门组成。这些菌类分享菲洛通过Zuggtmoy的孢子传播的幸福观，在猎人带来的尸体上做实验，或者在他们自己在丛林外的探险中猎取的活人身上做实验。他们的土丘位于一个淫秽花园的中心。",
	"Mutated by Zuggtmoy's spores, the circle leader has become an abomination. No longer recognizable as a myconid, it looks like a fungal larva slithering along the ground. Mold and lichen grow in hypnotic patterns along its ringed stalk, and it puffs clouds of spores from a slit resembling a mouth. It can use this orifice to actually speak, rather than depending on rapport spores. It no longer attends melds with the other leaders, instead sending its representative.": "被Zuggtmoy的孢子变异后，圆环首领已经变成了一个可憎的东西。它不再是可识别的菌类，看起来像一个在地面上滑行的真菌幼虫。霉菌和地衣沿着它的环状柄以催眠的方式生长，它从一个类似于嘴巴的缝隙中喷出孢子云。它可以用这个口子真正地说话，而不是依靠和睦的孢子。它不再参加与其他领导人的融合，而是派出它的代表。",
	"As the characters enter the garden, they make a frightening discovery.": "当人物进入花园时，他们有了一个可怕的发现。",
	"The low muttering grows louder as you reach the top, turning into a symphony of moans, cries, and hisses. The only light comes from a few glowing mushrooms along the edge, but even in the gloom, you can't miss the source of the sounds. The heads of creatures of a dozen humanoid Underdark races peek from the ground, mold and fungi growing around them.": "当你到达山顶时，低沉的咕哝声越来越大，变成了呻吟、哭喊和嘶嘶声的交响乐。唯一的光亮来自边缘的几个发光的蘑菇，但即使在阴暗中，你也不会错过声音的来源。十几个人形暗黑种族的生物的头颅从地面上探出，霉菌和真菌在它们周围生长。",
	"One voice calls out loudly in Undercommon—a female drow fighting to speak. \"Please... for your gods of light... kill me!\" She manages to stir within her living grave, raising a spider medallion half-embedded in the bloated growth that was once her hand. Half her face is rotten and pustulate, a bed for the sprouting of scores of tiny mushrooms. \"The Great Seeder... trap... she's here... the Lady of Decay... Zuggtmoy...\"": "有一个声音在地下城大声呼唤，一个女乌鸦奋力说话。\"请......为了你们的光明之神......杀了我！\" 她设法在她的活人墓里搅动，举起一个蜘蛛勋章，半截埋在曾经是她的手的臃肿的东西里。她的半边脸已经腐烂和化脓，成为几十个小蘑菇发芽的床。\"伟大的播种者......陷阱......她在这里......腐烂的女士...... Zuggtmoy...\"",
	"The drow is Xinaya, a young acolyte of Lolth. She was leading a routine scouting patrol out of Velkynvelve before Ilvara contacted her with a {@spell sending} spell. The patrol was ordered to search near the grove for the characters, anticipating that the escapees might seek shelter among the peaceful mushroom folk.": "这个乌鸦是辛纳亚，是洛尔思的年轻圣徒。在伊尔瓦拉用{@spell sending}的法术联系她之前，她正带领一支常规的侦察巡逻队离开维尔基维尔。巡逻队被命令在小树林附近搜索这些人物，预计逃跑者可能会在和平的蘑菇民中寻求庇护。",
	"Upon her arrival, Xinaya made the mistake of accepting Phylo's invitation to visit the Garden of Welcome, where she and her patrol quickly became victims of the myconids' madness. She begs the adventurers to end her suffering and warn her people about the presence of the Demon Queen of Fungi in the Underdark, unaware of the madness that has already erupted in Menzoberranzan and throughout the Underdark (see {@adventure chapter 15|OotA|14}). Xinaya is too far gone to be saved, and any amount of damage kills her.": "欣亚到达后，错误地接受了菲洛的邀请，参观了欢迎花园，她和她的巡逻队很快就成为了菌类疯狂的受害者。她恳求冒险者们结束她的痛苦，并警告她的人民，地下城中出现了真菌的恶魔女王，她不知道在门索布兰山和整个地下城已经爆发了疯狂的力量（见（%0%））。辛纳亚已经走得太远了，无法被拯救，任何程度的伤害都会杀死她。",
	"After the characters speak with Xinaya, {@creature Yestabrod|OotA} appears (see {@adventure appendix C|OotA|19}). The master of the foul garden takes delight in toying with trespassers.": "在人物与辛纳亚对话后，{@creature Yestabrod|OotA}出现（见{@adventure appendix C|OotA|19}）。肮脏花园的主人以玩弄闯入者为乐。",
	"The moans of the garden's victims suddenly take on a new tone of fear as something moves across the foul ground. A disgusting larval creature rises up before you, showing only vestigial fungal growths that hint that it might once have been a myconid.": "当有东西在肮脏的地面上移动时，花园里受害者的呻吟声突然有了一种新的恐惧语气。一个恶心的幼虫在你面前升起，只露出残余的真菌生长，暗示它可能曾经是一个菌类。",
	"\"Welcome, travelers.\" The aberrant myconid's voice gurgles and spits as it speaks both aloud and in your minds at once. \"Are you here for the wedding rehearsal? Friends of the bride or her intended? No matter! Let the love of the Great Seeder embrace you as you become one with her chosen, the Great Body!\"": "\"欢迎，旅行者们。\" 这个反常的霉菌的声音咕噜咕噜地吐着，它同时在你们的头脑中大声说话。\"你们是来参加婚礼彩排的吗？新娘的朋友还是她的意中人？没有关系! 让伟大的播种者的爱拥抱你们，因为你们将与她所选择的伟大的身体融为一体！\"",

	"Any character reduced to 0 hit points in this encounter is knocked {@condition unconscious} rather than killed.

	"The tableau of the mock wedding is replaced by a vision of the inside of a great tower. Spiraling stairs and balconies are carved into its walls, with the interior lit by phosphorescent patches of mold growing in whorls. In the center of the open space floats a humanoid figure, womanlike in form, but made entirely of fungi and mold.

	"When Zuggtmoy arrived in the Underdark, she was immediately drawn to Neverlight Grove and its fungal riches. She cultivated Yggmorgus, a mushroom of titanic proportions, from the rich, rotting soil.": "当Zuggtmoy来到暗黑世界时，她立刻被永光丛林和它的真菌财富所吸引。她从肥沃的腐烂土壤中培育出Yggmorgus，一种具有巨大比例的蘑菇。",
	"Conveniently secluded from the rest of the Underdark, Yggmorgus is a perfect base of operations for the Demon Queen of Fungi. She has completely enthralled Phylo, and the hapless sovereign is growing a myconid and spore servant army for her. Zuggtmoy has also become aware of Araumycos, the largest fungal life form—and possibly the largest creature of any kind—in the world. Araumycos is a vast fungus colony with a single mind, which fills the caverns and tunnels of the Underdark in an area the size of the High Forest. Araumycos is so interwoven with the fabric of the world that control of it would grant Zuggtmoy nearly unlimited power in her new home.": "Yggmorgus与暗黑世界的其他地方相隔甚远，是真菌恶魔女王的完美行动基地。她已经完全迷住了菲洛，而这位无能的君主正在为她培养一支菌类和孢子仆从军。Zuggtmoy也意识到了Araumycos，它是世界上最大的真菌生命体，而且可能是任何种类的最大生物。Araumycos是一个巨大的真菌群，它只有一个思想，充斥着地下世界的洞穴和隧道，面积相当于高级森林。Araumycos与世界的结构交织在一起，对它的控制将赋予Zuggtmoy在她的新家几乎无限的权力。",
	"Though Yggmorgus can't be seen clearly from the main cavern of Neverlight Grove, the unholy lights and sounds there can be discerned and sometimes even felt. Characters who ask the myconids about it receive mixed responses. Sovereign Phylo and those loyal to it enter a state of near bliss when they speak about Yggmorgus, as if it was a paradise. {@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA} and its followers give wary answers. Phylo's secrecy means that they aren't sure what lies beyond the ravine.": "虽然从永光丛林的主洞中无法清楚地看到伊格摩格斯，但那里的邪恶之光和声音可以被辨别出来，有时甚至可以感觉到。向菌类问起它的人物得到了不同的回应。主权者菲洛和那些忠于它的人在谈到Yggmorgus时进入了一种近乎幸福的状态，仿佛它是一个天堂。{@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA}和它的追随者给出了警惕的回答。Phylo的保密性意味着他们不确定峡谷之外有什么。",

	"You have no clear reference to judge the towering mushroom's size at this distance. Thousands of smaller fungi cling to the main stalk, which itself splits into several lesser stalks, each long enough with a cap big enough to be the top of a great tower.

An eerie luminescence pours through slitted windows carved into the trunk, with the same cacophony of atonal music heard earlier echoing within. A stench of rot and decay wraps around you, seemingly threatening to penetrate your flesh and pervade your soul.": "在这个距离上，你没有明确的参照物来判断这个高耸的蘑菇的大小。数以千计的较小的真菌附着在主茎上，主茎本身又分裂成几个较小的茎，每个茎都足够长，菌盖大到足以成为一座大塔的顶端。主茎周围的洞穴地面被真菌的地毯所覆盖。阴森恐怖的光亮透过刻在树干上的狭长窗口，与之前听到的无调音乐一样，在里面回荡。一股腐烂的臭味包裹着你，似乎要穿透你的肉体，弥漫你的灵魂。",

Other than a face, long white hair, and a breastplate, it is impossible to distinguish where the drow ends, and the rot and fungi consuming him begins. The drow feebly thrashes, his screams rising ever higher in pitch, until he locks eyes with one of the characters and abruptly stops screaming. A brief moment of lucidity replaces his terror, even as his eyes roll back into his head in some kind of bizarre euphoria as he goes limp and slowly sinks back down into the fungal muck. Characters witnessing this must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or gain one level of madness.": "仿佛是在提示，最靠近人物的一个肿块冒出了气泡并爆裂。一团密密麻麻的孢子和漆黑发臭的液体向外爆炸，甚至当角色们听到一声痛苦和恐怖的刺耳尖叫时。在爆裂留下的麻点内，是辛纳亚的一个乌鸦侦察员--或者至少是他的遗体。除了一张脸、长长的白发和一件胸甲之外，不可能分辨出哪里是乌鸦的终点，哪里是吞噬他的腐烂和真菌的起点。乌鸦无力地挣扎着，他的尖叫声越来越高，直到他与其中一个人物对视，突然停止了尖叫。短暂的清醒取代了他的恐惧，甚至他的眼睛在某种奇异的兴奋中滚回了他的脑袋，他瘫软下来，慢慢地沉入了真菌的泥沼中。目睹这一切的人物必须在DC13智慧救赎中成功，否则就会获得一级的疯狂。",

	"Dozens of spore servants and myconids respond to Zuggtmoy's telepathic call if their mistress is in danger, attacking the characters heedless of their own safety. Any attack that successfully deals damage to Zuggtmoy damages her gown, driving the demon queen into a rage to attack the intruders.": "如果他们的女主人处于危险之中，几十个孢子仆人和菌类会对Zuggtmoy的心灵感应做出反应，攻击角色，而不顾他们自己的安全。任何成功地对扎格莫伊造成伤害的攻击都会破坏她的袍子，使恶魔女王陷入愤怒，攻击入侵者。",
	"Leaving the myconid enclave is easier than finding it. Whether they politely avoid Phylo's invitation or flee for their lives and sanity from the Demon Queen of Fungi, the adventurers can easily receive the aid of {@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA} and the circles still loyal to it. Where the characters go next is up to them—a decision dependent upon where they have been, the pursuing drow, and whatever they have acquired (food, potions, treasure from the doomed drow patrol, and so on) during their visit to the grove.": "离开菌类飞地比找到它更容易。无论他们是礼貌地回避菲洛的邀请，还是为了自己的生命和理智而逃离真菌魔后，冒险者都可以轻易地得到（%0%）和仍然忠于它的圈子的援助。人物的下一步去向由他们决定--这取决于他们去过的地方、追捕的乌鸦，以及他们在访问小树林时获得的任何东西（食物、药水、来自注定失败的乌鸦巡逻队的财宝，等等）。",
	"Depending on how the characters interacted with the myconids and what tasks they accomplished for their hosts, they might depart in the company of a myconid guide, or even two whole circles of myconids fleeing the grove before Zuggtmoy's madness takes them. Sovereign Phylo doesn't stop the characters or {@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA} from leaving, still convinced the cause it embraces is one of joy and prosperity for its people.": "根据人物与霉菌的互动情况以及他们为主人完成的任务，他们可能会在一个霉菌向导的陪伴下离开，甚至是在Zuggtmoy的疯狂带走他们之前，有两整圈的霉菌逃离丛林。主权者Phylo并没有阻止人物或{@creature Sovereign Basidia|OotA}的离开，仍然相信它所拥护的事业是为其人民带来快乐和繁荣的。",
	"In all probability, the characters leave the fungal grove with dire and horrific news. They have witnessed the effect a single demon lord can have on the Material Plane—and they realize far more and worse things are coming.": "在所有的可能性中，角色们带着可怕的消息离开真菌丛林。他们已经目睹了一个恶魔领主对物质世界的影响--他们意识到更多更糟糕的事情即将发生。",
	"Regardless of how many battles the characters might have had inside Neverlight Grove, discovering that a demon lord is on the loose on the Material Plane is a major revelation. Moreover, if they were in Sloobludop to witness the rise of Demogorgon, they now know that more than one demon lord is at large, hinting at the magnitude of the threat.": "不管角色们在永光丛林里经历了多少次战斗，发现一个恶魔领主在物质世界里逍遥法外是一个重大的启示。此外，如果他们在斯洛布洛普见证了德摩根的崛起，他们现在知道不止一个恶魔领主在逃，暗示了威胁的严重性。",
	"If the adventurers simply passed through the grove and enjoyed the hospitality of the doomed myconids, they leave with only suspicions about their odd behavior, which can help them later in piecing together the greater mystery in the Underdark.": "如果冒险家们只是简单地穿过小树林，享受着注定失败的菌类的款待，那么他们离开时只能对它们的古怪行为产生怀疑，这可以帮助他们以后拼凑出地下城中更大的谜团。",
	"If the adventurers learned nothing about the presence of Zuggtmoy or her plans, you might pass the information on to them by having a friendly myconid such as {@creature Stool|OotA} or {@creature Rumpadump|OotA} come to them just as they are leaving. The myconid enters rapport and shows them a vision of the Garden of Welcome and Yggmorgus, saying these images come from the minds of other myconids in the grove, and asking what these \"strange dreams\" mean.": "如果冒险者们没有了解到关于祖格莫伊的存在或她的计划，你可以在他们即将离开时，让一个友好的菌类如（%0%）或（%1%）来找他们，把信息传递给他们。霉菌进入默契状态，向他们展示了迎宾花园和Yggmorgus的幻象，说这些图像来自小树林里其他霉菌的思想，并询问这些 \"奇怪的梦 \"意味着什么。",
	"Blingdenstone, once called the City of Speaking Stones, is a deep gnome settlement founded more than two millennia ago. The deep gnomes, insular and secretive by nature, care little about histories and legacies, and thus most of the ruined city's past is lost to time.": "Blingdenstone，曾经被称为 \"会说话的石头之城\"，是两千多年前建立的深层地精定居点。深层地精，生性孤僻而神秘，对历史和遗产不屑一顾，因此，这座废墟城市的大部分过去都消失在时间中。",
	"For centuries, Blingdenstone remained hidden and isolated from the rest of the Underdark, thanks to a combination of misdirection and magic. It wasn't until they provided shelter to a drow exile named Drizzt Do'Urden that the deep gnomes began to take a more active interest in the world outside their caverns. Perceiving the threat the drow represented to all the peoples of the Underdark, the deep gnomes abandoned their isolation when they came to the defense of the dwarves of Mithral Hall, defeating an invading drow force from Menzoberranzan.": "几个世纪以来，由于误导和魔法的结合，布林登石一直隐藏起来，与暗黑世界的其他地方隔绝。直到他们为一个名叫德里兹-多乌登（Drizzt Do'Urden）的鸦人流亡者提供了庇护，深层地精才开始对他们洞穴外的世界产生了更积极的兴趣。当深层地精意识到鸦人对暗黑世界所有人民的威胁时，他们放弃了与世隔绝的状态，为米特拉尔厅的矮人提供了保护，击败了一支来自门索布兰赞的鸦人入侵部队。",
	"This alliance, however, would spell Blingdenstone's doom. The vengeful drow bided their time, rebuilt their forces, and sent their armies out to strike back hard against the svirfneblin, returning in great force to lay siege to Blingdenstone. The deep gnomes were no match for the drow army. Thousands of svirfneblin were slaughtered, and those survivors who didn't escape to Mithral Hall or the surface world were dragged back in chains to Menzoberranzan as slaves.": "然而，这个联盟将宣告布林登斯顿的灭亡。复仇的鸦人等待时机，重建他们的部队，并派出他们的军队对svirfneblin进行猛烈的反击，以巨大的力量返回，围攻Blingdenstone。深海地精们不是鸦人军队的对手。数以千计的svirfneblin被屠杀，而那些没有逃到Mithral Hall或地表世界的幸存者则被锁链拖回Menzoberranzan作为奴隶。",
	"Within the past decade or so, the deep gnomes have returned to reclaim, resettle, and rebuild their city. The ultimate success of their efforts, however, hangs by a slender thread. Most of the ruined city is a dangerous place and remains closed off, with tunnels and chambers barricaded with gates or deliberately caused cave-ins. The svirfneblin must contend with incursions by wererat squatters, insane elementals, ghosts, and a plague of invading oozes controlled by {@creature the Pudding King|OotA}—a mad deep gnome under the influence of the demon lord Juiblex. Before they can offer the party any help, the deep gnomes likely need some themselves.": "在过去十年左右的时间里，深山地精们回到了这里，收回、重新安置并重建他们的城市。然而，他们的努力最终能否成功，还取决于一个细微的问题。废墟上的大部分地方都很危险，仍然被封闭着，隧道和房间都被门挡住，或者故意造成洞穴。svirfneblin必须应对wererat squatters、疯狂的元素、鬼魂的入侵，以及由{@creature the Pudding King|OotA}--一个受恶魔领主Juiblex影响的疯狂的深层地精--控制的入侵ozes瘟疫。在他们能够为党提供任何帮助之前，深层地精很可能自己也需要一些帮助。",
	"Blingdenstone is an obvious destination for characters seeking refuge from their drow pursuers and a way out of the Underdark. The deep gnomes continue to have regular dealings with the surface world.": "Blingdenstone是一个明显的目的地，可以让那些寻求庇护、躲避乌鸦追捕者和离开暗黑世界的角色。深海地精继续与地面世界保持着定期的交易。",
	"Among the party's fellow escapees, the deep gnome {@creature Jimjar|OotA} is the most enthusiastic about visiting Blingdenstone, and he can lead the adventurers there. {@creature Topsy|OotA} and {@creature Turvy|OotA} also know the way, but they are noticeably less willing to go to the settlement because of the fear and shame they feel regarding their lycanthropic affliction. The shield dwarf scout {@creature Eldeth Feldrun|OotA} isn't sure how to reach the gnome settlement, but is in favor of going there if it offers a route to the surface or to Gauntlgrym. If the characters allow {@creature Glabbagool|OotA} (the sentient gelatinous cube from \"{@area The Oozing Temple|0ca|x}\" in chapter 2) to accompany them, it feels a certain pull toward Blingdenstone, and is curious enough to guide the characters there.": "在队伍的同伴中，深山地精（%0%）对访问布林登石最热心，他可以带领冒险者前往。(1%）和（2%）也知道路，但他们明显不太愿意去定居点，因为他们对自己的狼人病感到恐惧和羞耻。盾牌矮人侦察员（%3%）不确定如何到达地精定居点，但如果那里有一条通往地表或Gauntlgrym的路线，他就会赞成去那里。如果角色允许{@creature Glabbagool|OotA}（第二章\"{@area The Oozing Temple|0ca|x} \"中的有生命的胶状立方体）陪伴他们，它对布林登斯通有一定的吸引力，并好奇地引导角色去那里。",
	"The svirfneblin settlement is a haven for the characters. For good reason, the deep gnomes rarely allow drow into Blingdenstone, and only then with a heavily armed escort. A drow character must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check to enter escorted. However, if any deep gnomes are traveling with the party, having them vouch for the drow allows the escort to be waived at your discretion.": "svirfneblin定居点是这些人物的天堂。出于充分的理由，深山地精们很少允许乌鸦进入布林登斯通，而且只有在全副武装的护卫下才允许。鸦人角色必须在DC15魅力({@skill Persuasion})检查中成功，才能在护送下进入。然而，如果有任何深层地精与队伍同行，让他们为乌鸦担保，就可以根据你的决定放弃护送。",
	"The party's drow pursuers won't attempt to follow the characters into Blingdenstone. The party's pursuit level (see \"{@area Drow Pursuit|078|x}\" in chapter 2) doesn't change while they are in the svirfneblin settlement.": "追捕他们的乌鸦人不会试图跟随他们进入布林登石。当他们在斯维尔芬林定居点时，队伍的追击等级（见第二章的\"（%0%）\"）不会改变。",
	"If the party's pursuit level is 3 or higher when they arrive at Blingdenstone, Ilvara and her party are watching the tunnels leaving the settlement.

	"Blingdenstone has a reputation for being a dangerous ruin inhabited only by monsters and other undesirables. Others think of it as a budding settlement well on its way to recovery. Once the characters reach the gates, they can see that the truth lies somewhere in between.": "Blingdenstone的名声是一个危险的废墟，只有怪物和其他不受欢迎的人居住在这里。其他人则认为它是一个正在萌芽的定居点，正在走向复兴。一旦人物到达大门，他们就会发现，真相就在两者之间。",
	"The characters must prove their goodwill to the deep gnomes before they are allowed inside. Once the characters win the gnomes' trust, they are welcomed into Inner Blingdenstone, and to what food and comfort the locals can readily provide.": "在被允许进入之前，角色们必须向深处的地精们证明他们的善意。一旦人物赢得了地精的信任，他们就会被欢迎进入内布林登斯通，并获得当地人可以随时提供的食物和安慰。",
	"Deep gnomes are a dour lot, reserved and careful in their dealings with outsiders. They make the assumption that every non-svirfneblin means to do them harm—which is understandable given their history. They speak softly in caves and tunnels where sound carries, eyes darting furtively, looking for signs of danger.": "深海地精是一个沉闷的群体，在与外人打交道时，他们保留并谨慎行事。他们假设每一个非精灵族人都想伤害他们--鉴于他们的历史，这一点是可以理解的。他们在有声音的洞穴和隧道里轻声说话，眼睛鬼鬼祟祟地闪动着，寻找危险的迹象。",
	"Despite their harsh outlook, svirfneblin are still gnomes, and many are as benevolent and joyful as their surface cousins. They reveal these aspects most easily among their own kind, and to those they come to trust.": "尽管前景严峻，但svirfneblin仍然是地精，而且许多人和他们的表亲一样仁慈和快乐。他们在自己的同类中，以及在他们信任的人面前，最容易透露出这些方面。",
	"The svirfneblin assign defined roles to each gender but hold females and males in equal standing. It is ancient custom for there to be both a king and a queen with equal responsibilities. Svirfneblin males are hunters, explorers, laborers, and warriors, while females are managers, judges, politicians, and caretakers. Deep gnomes sometimes forget this is not the case with other races, and that males are capable of careful thought just as much as females can fight.": "svirfneblin人给每个性别分配了明确的角色，但认为女性和男性地位平等。古老的习俗是有一个国王和一个王后，负有同等责任。Svirfneblin的男性是猎人、探险家、劳动者和战士，而女性是管理者、法官、政治家和看护人。深度地精有时会忘记其他种族的情况并非如此，男性能够仔细思考，就像女性能够战斗一样。",
	"The general attitude of deep gnomes toward strangers is hostile—not necessarily opposed, but deeply suspicious. This attitude can be shifted to indifferent and then friendly as the characters help the svirfneblin openly (see \"{@book Social Interaction|DMG|8|Social Interaction}\" in chapter 8 of the {@i Dungeon Master's Guide}).": "深山地精对陌生人的一般态度是敌对的--不一定是反对，而是深深地怀疑。这种态度可以转变为冷漠，然后随着人物公开帮助svirfneblin而变得友好（见《{@i Dungeon Master's Guide}》第八章中的\"{@book Social Interaction|DMG|8|Social Interaction}\"）。",
	"Some deeds in Blingdenstone reward the characters with an automatic attitude shift, while others require a DC 15 group Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. If the group check succeeds, the attitude of the svirfneblin shifts by one. If characters are rude or act in a way to make the deep gnomes more suspicious toward them, they must also make another group check. If this group check fails, the deep gnomes' attitude worsens by one.": "在布林登斯通的一些行为会使人物的态度自动转变，而其他行为则需要DC15的群体魅力（（%0%））检查。如果团体检定成功，svirfneblin的态度会转变一个。如果角色无礼或者行为方式让深海地精对他们更加怀疑，他们也必须进行另一次团体检查。如果这个团体检查失败，深海地精的态度会恶化一个。",

	"Although not truly organized, the ghosts of the svirfneblin killed during the drow attack are an undeniable presence. The settlers have been wise enough to mark haunted burrows off from their reclamation plans. But as new svirfneblin arrive and need accommodation, space is starting to become a problem.

	"The so-called Pudding King holds court in the deepest sections of Blingdenstone.

He offers a payment of 50 gp per character for useful information, plus a diamond worth 1,000 gp if they bring back proof that the medusa is dead.": "守卫的首领是一个名叫萨克-阿克斯巴雷尔（Sark Axebarrel）的愤世嫉俗的斯维尔芬林（svirfneblin），他警告角色们，有报告称门外的洞穴里潜伏着一只美杜莎，在地精所说的旧城的一个部分，即Rockblight。如果他们决定探索Rockblight，萨克要求他们尽一切可能找到关于美杜莎的信息，如果他们有能力的话，就杀掉她。他为每个角色提供了50金币的报酬，如果他们带回了证明美杜莎已经死亡的证据，还可以得到一颗价值1000金币的钻石。",
	"This cluster of caverns on the eastern end of the settlement serves as a workspace for weaponsmiths and armorsmiths. Traditional svirfneblin arms, including picks, darts, and daggers, along with ring mail, scale mail, and chain mail shirts, are forged and traded here. Less common equipment such as swords and shields can be custom ordered. Prices for weapons and armor are double those listed in the{@i Player's Handbook}.": "这个洞穴群位于定居点的东端，是武器工匠和盔甲工匠的工作场所。传统的斯维尔纳布林武器，包括镐头、飞镖和匕首，以及环甲、鳞甲和链甲衬衫，都在这里锻造和交易。不太常见的装备，如剑和盾牌，可以定制。武器和盔甲的价格是{@i Player's Handbook}中所列价格的两倍。",

	"These caverns branch off into smaller caves serving as hovels for families of svirfneblin. Tunnels lead to secondary chambers that branch out into more hovels. Deep gnome hovels have no doors.": "这些洞穴分支为更小的洞穴，作为斯维尔夫林家庭的住所。隧道通向次要的房间，而次要的房间又分出了更多的小屋子。深层地精的小窝没有门。",
