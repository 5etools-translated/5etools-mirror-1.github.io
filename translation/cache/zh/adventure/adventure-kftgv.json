Each adventure can be adapted to take place in any campaign setting you wish.": "{@i Keys from the Golden Vault}介绍了13个以抢劫为特色的龙与地下城冒险。在每个冒险中，人物都会接到一个任务，计划工作，执行计划，并试图逃离现场。你可以把每个抢劫案作为一个独立的冒险，或者作为一个更大的战役的一部分来运行（见本介绍后面的\"（1%）\"）。每一次冒险都可以改编为发生在任何你希望的战役环境中。",

	"The characters' success determines their reward and how the story might progress beyond the main adventure.": "人物的成功决定了他们的奖励，以及故事在主要冒险之后可能的进展。",

	"Rumored to be associated with metallic dragons, the Golden Vault is a secretive organization that has its base on one of the good-aligned Outer Planes. Its membership and activities are almost impossible for outsiders to track, but those in the know are aware that the organization rights moral wrongs, supports virtuous underdogs, and handles delicate situations local authorities won't touch.

	"Once an adventuring group proves itself effective and virtuous, an operative approaches the characters to offer Golden Vault membership.

For an example of a handler, see the \"{@area Meera Raheer|009|x}\" section.": "一旦一个冒险团证明自己是有效的、有德行的，一个特工就会接近这些人物，提供黄金库的成员资格。如果该团体接受，其成员就会加入金库的行列，而邀请他们的人就会成为他们未来任务的负责人。关于联络人的例子，见\"{@area Meera Raheer|009|x} \"部分。\"做好事，不计代价\"。金库的任务往往是非法的，但它们总是支持一个公正的、道德的事业。",
	"If the characters get stuck, the Golden Vault can provide unexpected help. For instance, if the characters lack vital information needed for a heist, their handler might share a recent discovery. If the characters need special equipment, their handler might be able to obtain it for them, provided the equipment is readily available and not too expensive.": "如果人物被卡住，金库可以提供意想不到的帮助。例如，如果人物缺乏抢劫所需的重要信息，他们的联系人可能会分享最近的发现。如果人物需要特殊的设备，他们的联络人可能会为他们获得这些设备，只要这些设备是现成的，而且不是太昂贵。\"做好事，不计代价\"。金库的任务往往是非法的，但它们总是支持一个公正的、道德的事业。",

	"If the characters become Golden Vault operatives, they receive an ornate, key-operated music box from their handler. Each adventure in this book includes a \"Using the Golden Vault\" section, in which the Golden Vault dispatches a golden key to the group, usually via a hired courier. When the golden key is inserted into the characters' music box and turned, the box pops open and plays a message that assigns them a heist, provides basic details, and sets them on the right path. After the message plays, the box closes and the key vanishes.": "如果这些人物成为金库的特工，他们会从他们的上家那里得到一个华丽的、用钥匙操作的音乐盒。本书中的每一次冒险都包括一个 \"使用金库 \"的部分，在这个部分中，金库通常通过一个受雇的信使将一把金钥匙派发给他们。当金钥匙插入人物的音乐盒并转动时，盒子就会弹开并播放一条信息，为他们指定一个抢劫案，提供基本细节，并使他们走上正确的道路。信息播放完毕后，盒子关闭，钥匙消失。一个处理程序的例子，见\"（%0%）\"部分。\"做好事，不计代价\"。金库的任务往往是非法的，但它们总是支持一个公正的、道德的事业。",
	"Secrecy is paramount for the Golden Vault. To protect the organization, the characters' handler never provides more information than is absolutely necessary. Similarly, Golden Vault operatives are aware of only a handful of their fellow members. This compartmentalization ensures no one individual knows enough to jeopardize the organization at large.": "对金库来说，保密是最重要的。为了保护组织，人物的处理者从不提供超过绝对必要的信息。同样地，金库特工只知道他们的少数几个同伴。这种分门别类的做法确保没有一个人知道足以危害整个组织的细节，并使他们走上正确的道路。信息播放完毕后，盒子关闭，钥匙消失。一个处理程序的例子，见\"（%0%）\"部分。\"做好事，不计代价\"。金库的任务往往是非法的，但它们总是支持一个公正的、道德的事业。",

It may pull strings to ensure members aren't incarcerated—or worse—depending on the organization's resources in the area.": "如果特工人员在为金库服务时触犯了法律，该组织会尽力保护他们。它可能会根据该组织在该地区的资源，牵线搭桥以确保成员不被监禁，或者更糟，并使他们走上正确的道路。信息播放完毕后，盒子关闭，钥匙消失。一个处理程序的例子，见\"（%0%）\"部分。\"做好事，不计代价\"。金库的任务往往是非法的，但它们总是支持一个公正的、道德的事业。",

	"When Meera was young, her kindhearted and upstanding mothers served as city clerks. But when they began investigating financial irregularities, the unscrupulous mayor framed them for embezzlement to cover his own corruption. The only evidence of the Raheers' innocence was a packet of letters between the mayor and his conspirators. The letters were locked in the mayor's office.": "当米拉年轻时，她善良和正直的母亲担任城市书记员。但当她们开始调查财务违规行为时，无良的市长为了掩盖自己的腐败行为而诬陷她们贪污。证明拉赫夫妇清白的唯一证据是市长和他的同谋者之间的一包信件。这些信被锁在市长的办公室里。",
	"Luckily for the Raheers, a crew of Golden Vault operatives infiltrated city hall, retrieved the letters, and revealed the mayor's crimes. The Raheers kept fighting against government corruption, and Meera has followed in her parents' footsteps, continuing their anti-corruption work by becoming a city's clerk and a member of the Golden Vault.": "幸运的是，一群金库特工潜入市政厅，取回了这些信件，并揭露了市长的罪行。拉赫夫妇继续与政府腐败作斗争，米拉也追随她父母的脚步，继续他们的反腐工作，成为一名城市的书记员和金库的一名成员。这些信被锁在市长的办公室里。",

	"Unforeseen complications are an iconic aspect of heist narratives. Whether they take the form of a rival crew appearing out of nowhere or a treasure that turns out to be fake, complications ratchet up the tension and require the characters to think on their feet.": "不可预见的复杂情况是抢劫案叙述的一个标志性方面。无论是突然出现的竞争对手，还是被证明是假的宝藏，复杂情况都会增加紧张感，并要求角色用自己的方式思考。",
	"If you want to challenge your players, consider adding one of the complications below to any of this book's adventures.": "如果你想挑战你的玩家，可以考虑在本书的任何一个冒险中加入下面的一个复杂情况。",
	"Many of this book's heists involve procuring a MacGuffin. Part of preparing for these heists is determining where the MacGuffin in question is located.": "本书中的许多抢劫案都涉及到采购MacGuffin。为这些抢劫做准备的部分工作是确定有关的MacGuffin的位置。",
	"If the characters are having too easy of a time finding the MacGuffin, consider shifting its location to another place that makes sense. Or consider revealing that the MacGuffin is a fake, and the real prize is still nearby. The characters should still be able to determine where it's really located.": "如果人物在寻找麦克格芬时太容易了，可以考虑将其位置转移到另一个有意义的地方。或者考虑透露麦克格芬是假的，而真正的奖品仍然在附近。人物应该仍然能够确定它的真正位置。",
	"For example, in \"{@adventure The Murkmire Malevolence|KftGV|1},\" perhaps the MacGuffin is no longer in the Gemstone Wing and is being stored in the museum's attic overnight. The characters could learn this detail by reading notes they discover in the curator's office or by questioning one of the museum guards.": "例如，在\"{@adventure The Murkmire Malevolence|KftGV|1} \"中，也许MacGuffin已经不在宝石翼，而是在博物馆的阁楼上存放了一夜。人物可以通过阅读他们在馆长办公室发现的笔记或询问博物馆的一个警卫来了解这个细节。",

	"You can add a rival crew to an adventure at any time. When you do, make it clear to the characters that they have competition.

Then it's up to the characters to chase their rivals and try to salvage the mission.": "注意人物对对手的存在有何反应。如果人物不遗余力地挫败尾随的对手或抓住领先的对手，那么人物应该在没有进一步复杂化的情况下实现他们的目标。如果人物无视对手的人员，对手就应该首先实现目标。然后，就需要角色们去追赶他们的对手，并试图挽回任务。",

	"On a recent expedition into the nearby Murkmire, the archaeologists unearthed a strange object. Light green, opaque, and with a gemstone-like sheen, this ovoid stone was covered in strange furrows. The stone seemed ritualistic in nature, but it matched no recorded historical practices, and no one could identify its composition. The more Dr. Dannell studied it, the more she became convinced this object, which the archaeologists dubbed the Murkmire Stone, was not created by any known civilization—and might be dangerous.": "在最近一次对附近的Murkmire的考察中，考古学家们发现了一个奇怪的物体。浅绿色，不透明，具有宝石般的光泽，这块卵形的石头上布满了奇怪的沟壑。这块石头似乎具有仪式感，但它与历史上记载的做法并不相符，而且没有人能够确定其成分。丹奈尔博士对它研究得越多，她就越相信这个被考古学家称为Murkmire石的物体不是由任何已知的文明创造的，而且可能是危险的。因此，在她毕业后，丹奈尔博士成为了瓦肯布洛夫的教员和野外科学家，陪同大学的考古人员在该地区进行挖掘。",
	"Dr. Dannell tried to convince the dig's archaeologists to isolate the Murkmire Stone until she could learn more about it, but word of the discovery spread quickly. When the Varkenbluff Museum of Natural History offered a generous price for the stone, it was soon whisked from the dig site to the museum.": "丹奈尔博士试图说服考古学家隔离默克米尔石，直到她能更多地了解它，但这个发现的消息很快传开了。当Varkenbluff自然历史博物馆为这块石头开出了丰厚的价格时，它很快就被从挖掘现场运到了博物馆。任何已知的文明--而且可能是危险的，其文化背景是无与伦比的，所以毕业后，Dannell博士成为Varkenbluff的一名教员和野外科学家，陪同大学的考古人员在该地区进行挖掘。",
	"Dr. Dannell continued to research the strange stone. Her concern turned to dread when she found descriptions of similar objects in her occult tomes. These objects were, in fact, the eggs of eldritch creatures. She learned that such eggs lay dormant for generations, but once the eggs are unearthed, the creatures within rapidly develop and hatch. The resulting creatures are ravenous for raw meat and grow exponentially as they feed, eventually overwhelming entire villages. The eggs are nearly indestructible, but the tomes claim encasing them in crystal can neutralize them.": "Dannell博士继续研究这块奇怪的石头。当她在她的神秘学书籍中发现对类似物体的描述时，她的担忧变成了恐惧。事实上，这些物体是长生生物的卵。她了解到，这种蛋会休眠几代人，但一旦蛋被挖掘出来，里面的生物就会迅速发育和孵化。孵化出来的生物对生肉非常渴望，并在进食时成倍增长，最终压倒了整个村庄。这些蛋几乎是无坚不摧的，但文献中声称将它们包裹在水晶中可以中和它们。Rkenbluff的教员和野外科学家，陪同大学的考古人员在该地区进行挖掘。博物馆，偷蛋，并在它释放出长生不老的恐怖之前将其送还给Cassee Dannell博士，使其中和。",

She frantically presented her findings to the university's administrators, who deemed her work pseudoscience and refused to interfere with the museum's upcoming exhibition of the Murkmire Stone. Desperate, Dr. Dannell snuck into the museum after hours and tried to steal the stone, but she was caught. The university disavowed her actions and fired her. With mere hours left in the Murkmire Stone's gestation period, Dr. Dannell is nearly out of options.": "根据Dannell博士的研究，Murkmire石将在几天后孵化。她疯狂地将她的研究结果提交给大学的管理人员，后者认为她的工作是伪科学，并拒绝干涉博物馆即将举行的默克米尔石展览。走投无路之下，丹尼尔博士在下班后潜入博物馆，试图偷走石头，但她被抓住了。大学不承认她的行为并解雇了她。在Murkmire石的孕育期只剩下几个小时的时候，Dannell博士几乎没有了选择。Rkenbluff的教员和野外科学家，陪同大学的考古人员在该地区进行挖掘。",
