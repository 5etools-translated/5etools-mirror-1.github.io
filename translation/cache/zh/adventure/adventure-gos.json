	"Saltmarsh is a nondescript fishing village tucked away on the southern coast of the Kingdom of Keoland. For several generations, Keoland was a formidable military power. Its superior cavalry and bold knights pushed the kingdom's borders outward to the north, west, and east. Each successful campaign increased both the crown's wealth and power, and each one in turn drew the kingdom's attention even farther north. The southern coastal regions of Keoland remained a backwater.": "萨尔马什是一个不起眼的渔村，隐藏在基奥兰王国的南部海岸。几代人以来，Keoland是一个强大的军事力量。它优秀的骑兵和勇敢的骑士将王国的边界向北、向西、向东推进。每一次成功的战役都增加了王室的财富和权力，而每一次战役又将王国的注意力吸引到更远的北方。Keoland的南部沿海地区仍然是一个落后的地方。",
	"The crown's benign neglect allowed piracy and banditry to flourish. Saltmarsh and similar towns kept to fishing, content to maintain a low profile and avoid governmental entanglements. Decades ago, the pirates who prowled the waters off Saltmarsh grew strong enough to create their own realm, a loose confederacy known as the Hold of the Sea Princes. With the rise of that nation came increased raids on Saltmarsh and its neighbors. The Sea Princes' raiding ships pillaged the coast for more slaves to support their growing realm, and Saltmarsh suffered heavily. The memories of those times loom heavily over the area, and the locals' hatred of the Sea Princes runs deep.": "王室的善意忽视使海盗和强盗行为得以猖獗。萨尔马什和类似的城镇一直在捕鱼，满足于保持低调，避免政府的纠缠。几十年前，在萨尔马什附近水域游荡的海盗们逐渐强大到足以创建自己的王国，一个松散的联盟，被称为 \"海王子之家\"。随着这个国家的崛起，对萨尔马什和其邻国的袭击也越来越多。海王子们的袭击船在海岸上掠夺更多的奴隶，以支持他们不断增长的王国，萨尔特马什遭受了严重的损失。那个时代的记忆深深地笼罩着这个地区，当地人对海王子的恨意也很深。",
	"In time, Keoland's victories in the north gave way to a string of defeats in which its neighbors pushed the kingdom back to its original boundaries. With the world closing in, King Kimbertos Skotti looked to the south and saw unchecked banditry and a rising pirate nation. The crown struck peace treaties with its former foes to the north, raised a navy, and dealt a sharp check to the ambitions of the Sea Princes—but the conflict is by no means over.": "随着时间的推移，Keoland在北方的胜利让位于一连串的失败，它的邻国将王国逼回了它原来的边界。随着世界的逼近，国王金伯托斯-斯科蒂向南方看去，看到了不受控制的强盗行为和一个崛起的海盗国家。王室与北方的前敌人签订了和平条约，组建了海军，并对海王子的野心进行了猛烈的打击，但冲突还没有结束。",
	"King Skotti has decreed that the pirates must be put down, the sea lanes secured, and trade cultivated. If Keoland cannot prosper as a military force, it must grow mightier as a center of trade.": "斯科蒂国王已经下令，必须镇压海盗，确保海上通道的安全，并培育贸易。如果基奥兰不能作为一支军事力量而繁荣，它就必须作为一个贸易中心而变得更加强大。",
	"Saltmarsh, remote though it might be from the center of power in Keoland, is entering a new phase of its life as it reacts to the king's plans. The crown's agents want to expand the village's port and make it a prime location for trade with the world beyond. In another recent development, a band of dwarves—bearing a decree from the king himself—have arrived and begun to excavate the hills and seaside cliffs near town, looking for precious metals. If their work bears fruit as expected, the mine stands to become a major factor in the village's—and, indeed, the entire region's—prosperity.": "萨尔马什，尽管它可能远离Keoland的权力中心，但随着对国王计划的反应，它的生活正进入一个新阶段。国王的代理人想扩大村庄的港口，使其成为与世界其他地方进行贸易的主要地点。在另一个最近的发展中，一队矮人--带着国王本人的命令--已经到达，并开始挖掘城镇附近的山丘和海边的悬崖，寻找贵重金属。如果他们的工作如期取得成果，该矿将成为该村--实际上是整个地区繁荣的一个主要因素。",
	"Naturally, not all of Saltmarsh's residents feel the same way about the recent developments in and around their community, which is the key issue that affects their lives and livelihood. Although the recent changes stand to bring new prosperity to the area, many locals don't want to see their home changed. At the same time, as an undercurrent through all the goings-on, agents of the secretive and mysterious Scarlet Brotherhood work to thwart Keoland's ambitions while advancing their own.": "自然，并不是所有Saltmarsh的居民都对他们社区内和周围的最新发展有同样的感受，这也是影响他们生活和生计的关键问题。虽然最近的变化站在为该地区带来新的繁荣，但许多当地人并不希望看到他们的家园被改变。同时，作为贯穿所有事件的暗流，秘密和神秘的血色兄弟会的代理人努力挫败基奥兰的野心，同时推进他们自己的野心。",
	"Saltmarsh's future rests in the hands of three factions that compete for supremacy. Two of the factions represent the opposing sentiments that have grown in town in recent years. The third is a secret group that seeks to undermine Saltmarsh and seize control of the region. These factions' struggles play out in the day-to-day lives of the townsfolk and the political maneuvering of Saltmarsh's town council.": "萨尔马什的未来掌握在三个争夺霸权的派别手中。其中两个派别代表了近年来在镇上发展起来的对立情绪。第三个是一个秘密组织，试图破坏萨尔马什并夺取对该地区的控制权。这些派别的斗争在镇民的日常生活和萨尔马什镇议会的政治活动中得到了体现。",
	"The traditionalist faction is an alliance of the prominent fishing families and merchants in town, along with the workers who rely on those industries for a living. The traditionalists remember the terrible times during the Sea Princes' raids and have no desire to see the crown's ambitions lead to open war. The smugglers who operate in the area tend to be traditionalists. Most pose as merchants and rely on their local contacts to move goods through the region without interference from the town guard or royal agents. Smuggling has long been an easy way to make money in Saltmarsh, and locals generally look the other way, seeing it as a victimless crime.": "传统派是由镇上著名的渔业家族和商人，以及依靠这些行业谋生的工人组成的联盟。传统派记得海王子突袭时的可怕时光，不希望看到王室的野心导致公开战争。在该地区经营的走私者往往是传统主义者。大多数人冒充商人，依靠他们在当地的关系，在不受城镇卫队或皇家特工干扰的情况下在该地区运输货物。走私长期以来一直是在萨尔马什赚钱的一个简单方法，当地人一般都睁一只眼闭一只眼，把它看作是一种无害的犯罪。",
	"The traditionalists would like to see the dwarves' mining efforts fail and interest from the north wane, so that Saltmarsh's dependable fishing trade can thrive and the smugglers in the area are left alone. They resent the intrusion of outsiders seeking to transform Saltmarsh and undoubtedly drain power from the fishing families to give to dwarves and merchants.": "传统主义者希望看到矮人的采矿工作失败，来自北方的兴趣减弱，这样萨尔马什可靠的渔业贸易就能蓬勃发展，而该地区的走私者就不会受到影响。他们憎恨外来者的入侵，试图改造萨尔马什，无疑是将权力从渔民家庭中抽出，交给矮人和商人。",
	"This faction relies on two council members for representation. Eda Oweland leads the faction and can count on Gellan Primewater to back her up. Anders Solmor is young and unpredictable, but he has supported the traditionalists' viewpoint on most issues.": "这个派别依靠两名理事会成员来代表。艾达-奥维兰领导着这一派别，可以指望盖兰-普里姆沃特支持她。安德斯-索尔莫（Anders Solmor）年轻且难以预测，但他在大多数问题上都支持传统主义者的观点。",
	"At their best, traditionalists are community-minded folk who want Saltmarsh to return to its old way of doing things, arguing that the town has survived for a century by sticking to its original priorities. They suffered mightily due to the Sea Princes' depredations and remember the days when the crown turned a blind eye to their troubles. Their loyalty to the king runs second to their desire for peace and quiet.": "传统主义者最好是有社区意识的民间人士，他们希望萨尔马什恢复其旧有的行事方式，认为该镇通过坚持其原有的优先事项，已经生存了一个世纪。他们因海王子的掠夺而遭受了巨大的损失，并记得王室对他们的麻烦视而不见的日子。他们对国王的忠诚仅次于对和平与安静的渴望。",
	"Eda (CG female human {@creature noble}) is the current senior member of the town council, as well as the owner of three large fishing boats. She has lived in Saltmarsh all her life and has been elected to the council three times. She is a gruff, pragmatic woman whose graying hair is cut short and whose face bears the marks of a life lived outdoors. Eda is keenly interested in expanding Saltmarsh's fishing industry, her sights set on a wild section of the coast where she hopes to build a new dock. She is suspicious of the dwarves' mining enterprise and doubts it will amount to much.": "艾达（CG女性人类（%0%））是目前镇议会的高级成员，同时也是三艘大渔船的船主。她一生都生活在萨尔马什，曾三次当选为议会成员。她是一个粗暴、务实的女人，她的白发被剪短，脸上有户外生活的痕迹。艾达对扩大萨尔马什的渔业非常感兴趣，她的目光投向了海岸的一个荒芜地段，希望在那里建造一个新的码头。她对矮人的采矿业心存疑虑，并怀疑它是否会有什么结果。",
	"Eda swears like a sailor when she is frustrated or angry, and the folk in town who support her appreciate her willingness to stick up for them. Despite her temper, she respects those who keep their cool. Anyone who stands up to her wins her respect. Those who try to flatter her earn her contempt.": "艾达在沮丧或愤怒时像水手一样说脏话，镇上支持她的人很欣赏她愿意为他们撑腰。尽管她的脾气不好，但她尊重那些保持冷静的人。任何站在她面前的人都能赢得她的尊重。那些试图奉承她的人则赢得她的蔑视。",
	"If anyone in town needs help, Eda is the first to volunteer. She believes community binds people together and allows them to ride out the fiercest storm.": "如果镇上有人需要帮助，艾达是第一个志愿者。她相信社区将人们联系在一起，使他们能够度过最猛烈的风暴。",
	"Saltmarsh is Eda's home. She would protect it to her dying breath and wants its people to prosper.": "萨尔马什是艾达的家。她会誓死保护它，并希望它的人民能够繁荣。",
	"Eda is suspicious of outsiders, and she is too quick to trust those familiar to her.": "艾达对外人充满怀疑，她太急于相信她熟悉的人。",
	"Gellan (NE male human {@creature noble}) is a well-spoken, dapper older gentleman with a neatly trimmed beard and a fancy wardrobe. With his cunning instincts, he has positioned his family to become the most prominent merchants in town, but he now faces an intractable problem. Gellan made his fortune through smuggling, his textile and lumber exports serving as a cover for his illegal activities. When Saltmarsh was a sleepy backwater, he could operate with impunity. Now that Saltmarsh has attracted attention from the outside world, he sees business growing more difficult and less profitable.": "盖兰（NE男性人类{@creature noble}）是一个能说会道、潇洒的老先生，有着修剪整齐的胡须和花哨的衣橱。凭借他狡猾的直觉，他将自己的家族定位为镇上最著名的商人，但他现在面临一个棘手的问题。盖兰通过走私发了财，他的纺织品和木材出口成为其非法活动的掩护。当萨尔马什还是一个沉睡的落后地区时，他可以肆无忌惮地经营。现在，萨尔马什已经吸引了外部世界的注意，他看到生意越来越难做，利润越来越低。",
	"Over the years, Gellan has cultivated relationships with a number of contacts among the Sea Princes. His ships move illicit goods, including slaves, between their realm and Keoland. Gellan takes care to keep this side of his business quiet, since any hint of involvement with slave traders would mean the end of his days in Saltmarsh, if not his life.": "多年来，盖兰与海族王子中的一些联系人培养了关系。他的船在他们的王国和基奥兰之间运送非法货物，包括奴隶。盖兰小心翼翼地对他的这部分业务保持沉默，因为任何与奴隶贩子有关的暗示都意味着他在萨尔马什的日子要结束了，如果不是他的生命。",
	"Gellan seeks to keep his smuggling cartel functioning with as little interference as possible. Having a seat on the council puts him in a perfect position to maintain his business while supporting all aspects of the traditionalists' agenda. His popularity in the faction is second only to that of Eda Oweland.": "Gellan试图在尽可能少的干扰下保持他的走私集团的运作。在议会中拥有一个席位使他处于一个完美的位置，既能维持他的生意，又能支持传统派的各方面议程。他在该派别中的声望仅次于艾达-欧文兰。",
	"Because Gellan is the wealthiest man in town, he garners a great deal of popular support from the many feasts, entertainments, and other diversions he supports with expenditures and donations. He pretends to care little for the daily functions of the council, defaulting to throw his support behind Eda's position. In truth, this deference is a ruse he uses to mask his efforts to shield his smuggling operation.": "由于盖兰是镇上最富有的人，他从许多宴会、娱乐活动和其他他用支出和捐款支持的娱乐活动中获得了大量的民众支持。他假装不关心议会的日常职能，默认自己支持艾达的立场。事实上，这种尊重是他用来掩盖他努力保护自己的走私活动的诡计。",
	"Gellan loves to play the role of the foppish dandy. He enjoys fine wine, good food, and the latest fashions. He is a patron of the arts and spends lavishly to support festivals, plays, and concerts.": "盖兰喜欢扮演轻浮的花花公子的角色。他喜欢美酒、美食和最新的时尚。他是艺术的赞助人，花钱大手大脚地支持节日、戏剧和音乐会。",
	"For Gellan, beauty and elegance are everything. He derives great enjoyment from watching the town enjoy his events.": "对盖兰来说，美丽和优雅就是一切。他从看着镇上的人享受他的活动中获得了极大的乐趣。",
	"Gellan values his reputation above all else. He wants to be admired by the people of Saltmarsh.": "盖兰把自己的声誉看得比什么都重要。他希望被萨尔马什的人们所敬仰。",
	"Greed colors every action Gellan takes. He can't turn down a chance to turn a profit, even if it means breaking the law. Gellan secretly believes that even if he is caught, he can spend his way back into the town's good graces by throwing the biggest, most extravagant festival Saltmarsh has ever seen.": "贪婪使盖伦的每一个行动都充满色彩。他不能拒绝赚钱的机会，即使这意味着违反法律。Gellan秘密地相信，即使他被抓，他也可以通过举办萨尔马什有史以来最大、最奢侈的节日来重新获得镇上的好感。",
	"The traditionalists simply want things to remain the same. If they had their way, the dwarves would go home, the guard would stick to dealing with monsters rather than hassling honest traders, and the crown would go back to dreaming of conquests in the north. The more things change, the more this faction resorts to open protest and resistance.": "传统主义者只是希望事情保持不变。如果他们有自己的方式，矮人就会回家，卫队就会坚持对付怪物而不是骚扰诚实的商人，而王室就会回去梦想在北方的征服。事情越是变化，这个派别就越是诉诸于公开抗议和抵抗。",
	"A group of fishers accosts dwarves and other outsiders, demanding they leave town or else.": "一群渔民与矮人和其他外来者搭讪，要求他们离开镇子，否则。",
	"Gellan Primewater imports a variety of exotic flowers that he uses to decorate the town, while also distributing fresh tropical fruit free of charge to the townsfolk.": "杰兰-普里姆沃特进口各种异国花卉，用来装饰小镇，同时还免费向镇民分发新鲜的热带水果。",
	"A fire breaks out in town, and Eda Oweland raises funds to support those who lost their homes.": "镇上发生了一场火灾，艾达-欧沃兰筹集资金以支持那些失去家园的人。",
	"A fishing boat goes missing with its crew. They were smuggling a haul of black pearls, and Gellan wants his treasure back without risking his cover.": "一艘渔船和它的船员失踪了。他们偷运了一批黑珍珠，盖兰想在不危及自己身份的情况下拿回他的财宝。",
	"A bountiful catch leads to a day of feasting and reconciliation, giving the factions a chance to make amends.": "丰富的收获导致了一天的盛宴与和解，给各派别一个弥补的机会。",
	"A bungled smuggling operation lands a few respected people in jail, leading to near riots as fishers gather in a huge mob to effect a breakout.": "一次失败的走私行动使一些受人尊敬的人被关进了监狱，导致渔民们聚集成巨大的暴徒来实现突围，从而导致了近乎暴乱。",
	"A horrible sea creature has been sighted, keeping many crews at the docks until it disappears. Anyone who tracks it down and slays it would be a hero. Gellan pledges a magic weapon to its slayer.": "有人发现了一种可怕的海洋生物，让许多船员在码头上呆着，直到它消失。任何追踪到它并杀死它的人都会成为英雄。Gellan将一件魔法武器承诺给它的杀手。",
	"Several fishing crews have gone missing. The locals demand that Keoland dispatch a squadron of ships to track down the slavers from the Sea Princes who surely kidnapped them.": "几名捕鱼人员失踪了。当地人要求Keoland派遣一个中队的船只去追踪肯定绑架了他们的海王子的奴隶主。",
	"The loyalists consist of newcomers who arrived from the northern reaches of Keoland, loyal to King Kimbertos Skotti. They feel that the town should focus on becoming a useful asset to the crown and value the good of the kingdom before the good of the region. The town guard, the dwarves, and the local farmers are generally loyalists.": "忠诚的人由从Keoland北部到达的新来者组成，他们忠于Kimbertos Skotti国王。他们认为该镇应该专注于成为王室的有用资产，并将王国的利益置于该地区的利益之上。镇上的卫兵、矮人和当地的农民一般都是忠诚的。",
	"The loyalists care about security. They want to keep Keoland's enemies at bay while ensuring law and order. They see smuggling as a key problem, as it enriches the Sea Princes at the cost of the royal treasury and the efforts of honest merchants.": "忠诚的人关心安全问题。他们希望在确保法律和秩序的同时，将Keoland的敌人挡在门外。他们认为走私是一个关键问题，因为它以皇家国库和诚实商人的努力为代价使海族王子发财。",
	"Above all else, the members of this faction put their faith in law. They exert influence through the town guard, though they remain within their legal authority.": "最重要的是，这个派别的成员把他们的信仰放在法律上。他们通过城镇警卫队施加影响，尽管他们仍在法律授权范围内。",
	"At their best, the loyalists want to grow Saltmarsh into a trading hub with a higher standard of living and improved security. If the Sea Princes are held in check and the sea lanes cleared of threats, Saltmarsh can grow to become the envy of the world.": "在他们最好的情况下，忠诚者希望将萨尔马什发展成一个贸易中心，拥有更高的生活水平和更好的安全。如果海王子被控制住了，海上通道的威胁被清除了，萨尔马什可以发展成为世界上令人羡慕的地方。",
	"At their worst, the loyalists see the people of Saltmarsh as a barrier to growth. The locals are little more than allies of the Sea Princes, traitors who for too long have evaded the crown's notice. If they were to do as the loyalists tell them, then perhaps this {@creature fish|GoS}-reeking pile of a town could become something respectable.": "在他们最坏的情况下，效忠者将萨尔马什的人民视为发展的障碍。当地人只不过是海王子的盟友，是长期以来躲避王室注意的叛徒。如果他们按照效忠者的要求去做，那么这个{@creature fish|GoS}臭气熏天的小镇也许会成为一个值得尊敬的地方。",
	"Eliander (LN male human {@creature gladiator}) fought in the royal army of Keoland, where he earned a name driving the wild things of the Dreadwood away from the settled lands. Eliander suffered a tremendous injury to his leg in a battle against an owlbear and now walks upon a finely carved wooden peg. Despite his injury and advancing age, the burly captain of the Saltmarsh town guard remains an imposing figure. Eliander is a local celebrity thanks to his facility with languages, and he is often called upon by the town's various organizations to assist with translations. He is fully literate in Common, Dwarvish, Gnomish, Elvish, and Halfling; he can also speak and understand Orc and Draconic.": "Eliander（LN男性人类（%0%））在Keoland的皇家军队中作战，在那里他赢得了将Dreadwood的野物从定居的土地上赶走的名声。在一次与猫头鹰熊的战斗中，埃利安德的腿部受到了巨大的伤害，现在他是在一个精雕细琢的木桩上行走的。尽管他的伤势和年龄不断增长，这位粗壮的萨尔马什镇卫队队长仍然是一个威严的人物。埃利安德是当地的名人，这要归功于他的语言能力，他经常被镇上的各种组织要求协助进行翻译。他精通普通话、矮人语、地精语、精灵语和半身人语；他还能说和听懂兽人语和龙语。",
	"In a crisis, Eliander Fireborn might put the good of the crown above local rule. He possesses a royal writ that allows him to seize authority over the town guard in case of an emergency. He is loath to use it, as the locals might react to his seizure of power with an open revolt.": "在危机中，埃利安德-弗尔邦可能会把王室的利益置于地方统治之上。他拥有一份皇室令状，允许他在紧急情况下夺取镇上卫队的权力。他不愿意使用它，因为当地人可能会对他夺取的权力做出公开的反应。",

He recognizes that Saltmarsh is on the verge of tremendous growth, but he sees the influence of the Sea Princes behind every stroke of misfortune. Slow and steady wins the day, as he likes to say.": "谨慎指导着埃利安德的思想和他的每一个行动。他认识到萨尔马什正处于巨大发展的边缘，但他看到每一次不幸的背后都有海王子的影响。正如他喜欢说的那样，缓慢而稳定地赢得今天。",

	"The leader of the newly established mining operation in Saltmarsh is an iron-willed dwarven woman named Manistrad (LN female dwarf {@creature veteran}). She runs the mining outfit from a small office near the edge of town. Manistrad is a competent leader, as well as a savvy miner with a knack for pulling off impossible jobs. She's convinced that the veins of silver found in the cliffs near Saltmarsh are indicative of more valuable stones deeper in the rock. She was once a fearsome warrior, and she's not above delivering a few well-placed blows to ensure her orders are followed.": "在萨尔马什新成立的矿业公司的领导人是一位意志坚定的矮人妇女，名叫玛尼斯特拉德（LN女矮人（%0%））。她在镇子边缘的一个小办公室里经营采矿业。玛尼斯特拉是一个称职的领导者，也是一个精明的矿工，擅长完成不可能完成的工作。她相信在萨尔马什附近的悬崖上发现的银矿脉表明在岩石深处有更有价值的石头。她曾经是一个可怕的战士，她也不忘给自己几下，以确保她的命令得到遵守。",
	"Manistrad occupies an awkward place on the council. She was placed in her position by royal decree; the crown decided that if Saltmarsh is to support a mining operation, the miners would need a political voice. A more diplomatic figure might have smoothed over the tension, but Manistrad has little patience and sees the rest of the council, save for Eliander, as rustic dullards.": "马尼斯特拉在议会中占据了一个尴尬的位置。她的职位是由皇家法令安排的；王室决定，如果萨尔马什要支持采矿作业，矿工就需要一个政治上的声音。一个更有外交手腕的人物可能会抚平紧张局势，但玛尼斯特拉却没有什么耐心，在她看来，除了埃利安德之外，议会的其他成员都是土里土气的呆子。",
	"Manistrad is a woman of few words. She is curt and quick, yet she gives every person who comes before the council a fair accounting. She's nobody's fool.": "马尼斯特拉是个寡言的女人。她说话客气而迅速，但她给每一个来到议会的人一个公平的交代。她不是任何人的傻瓜。",

	"Manistrad has little patience; she tends to push for quick results over a more measured approach.": "马尼斯特拉德没有什么耐心；她倾向于推动快速的结果，而不是更有分寸的方法。",
	"The loyalists are focused on two things: ensuring that the dwarven mine is a success, and clamping down on smuggling to keep the Sea Princes in check.

His recent forays into trade have made him a local celebrity. Since Anders owns both a fishing fleet and several trading vessels, he can sell his catch at a highly competitive price. And he can offer better prices for the other fishers in town to sell to him, since his catch brings in so much more profit.": "年轻的安德斯（LG男性人类（%0%））在他母亲佩特拉早逝后，最近继承了他家的渔船队。他是有史以来被选入议会的最年轻的人。安德斯是一个身材矮小的人，有着尖锐的特征和露齿的微笑。他最近对贸易的探索使他成为当地的名人。由于安德斯同时拥有一支捕鱼船队和几艘贸易船，他可以以极具竞争力的价格出售他的渔获。而且，他可以为镇上的其他渔民提供更好的价格，让他们卖给他，因为他的渔获带来了更多的利润。",
	"Everyone involved in the town's fishing industry supports Anders, and his energy and ambition have made him something of a folk hero on the docks. On the other hand, his open opposition to smuggling and his hatred of the Sea Princes' practice of slavery makes him a thorn in the smugglers' side.": "每个参与该镇渔业的人都支持安德斯，他的精力和雄心使他成为码头上的民间英雄。另一方面，他公开反对走私，憎恨海王子的奴隶制做法，使他成为走私者的眼中钉。",
	"Unbeknownst to Anders, his butler, Skerrin Wavechaser, is an agent for the Scarlet Brotherhood. He engineered the death of Anders' mother and has placed a number of Brotherhood agents in key positions in the Solmor fleet.": "安德斯不知道，他的管家Skerrin Wavechaser是猩红兄弟会的特工。他策划了安德斯母亲的死亡，并将一些兄弟会的特工安排在索尔摩舰队的关键位置。",
	"Anders is sunny and optimistic. He sees the potential for profit and opportunity in every challenge. Unfortunately, he is too young to temper his views with a realistic assessment of the risks.": "安德斯是阳光和乐观的。他在每一个挑战中都能看到利润和机会的潜力。不幸的是，他太年轻了，无法用对风险的现实评估来调整他的观点。",
	"Anders believes that freedom is the root of happiness. He pays his employees well and wants to help Saltmarsh grow into a prosperous town. Above all else, he hates the Sea Princes and wants to see their realm and its slave trade scoured from the earth.": "安德斯相信，自由是幸福的根源。他给员工的工资很高，希望帮助萨尔马什发展成为一个繁荣的城镇。最重要的是，他痛恨海族王子，希望看到他们的王国和奴隶贸易从地球上消失。",
	"Anders's mother Petra was the center of his life, and his sense of responsibility stems from her example. Every important decision he makes is guided by his desire to live up to her standards. If Skerrin is implicated in her murder, his hold over Anders would be shattered. For now, Skerrin uses Petra's memory to fan Anders's antipathy toward the Sea Princes.": "安德斯的母亲佩特拉是他生活的中心，他的责任感源于她的榜样。他所做的每一个重要决定都是以他希望达到她的标准为指导。如果斯凯林与她的谋杀案有牵连，他对安德斯的控制就会被打破。目前，斯凯林利用佩特拉的记忆来煽动安德斯对海族王子的反感。",
	"Due to a combination of his youth and his somewhat sheltered upbringing, Anders is naïve. He relied on his mother's expertise in most matters, which has allowed Skerrin to worm his way into Anders's confidence.": "由于年轻和他有些受庇护的成长经历，安德斯很天真。他在大多数事情上依赖他母亲的专业知识，这使得斯凯林能够以蠕虫方式进入安德斯的信心。",
	"Skerrin (LE male human {@creature assassin}) is secretly the head Brotherhood agent in town. Tall, lean, tan, with short silver hair, he speaks in precise, measured statements of a man who has a keen eye for detail. He is dispassionate and takes a protective stance toward Anders. To observers, he is nothing more than a faithful and trusted butler.": "斯凯林（LE男性人类（%0%））是镇上兄弟会的秘密头目。他身材高大，瘦削，皮肤黝黑，有一头银色的短发，说话准确，有分寸，是一个对细节有着敏锐洞察力的人。他是个冷静的人，对安德斯采取保护的态度。对于观察者来说，他只不过是一个忠实的、值得信赖的管家。",
	"Skerrin was renowned for his patience during his days as an assassin for the Brotherhood. Once, he hid himself in the attic above a noble's bedroom, waiting in a trance-like state for three days and nights until his target was positioned just below a small crack in the room's ceiling. Skerrin squeezed a single drop from a vial of poison he carried on to the noble's bald scalp. He waited in his hiding place for another full day until the contact poison killed the man.": "斯凯林在为兄弟会担任刺客的日子里，以其耐心而闻名。有一次，他把自己藏在一个贵族卧室的阁楼上，在恍惚的状态下等了三天三夜，直到他的目标被安置在房间天花板的一个小裂缝下面。斯凯林从他携带的一小瓶毒药中挤出一滴，滴在贵族的秃头皮上。他在藏身之处又等了一整天，直到接触性毒药杀死这个人。",
	"Skerrin is literally a man of two personalities. He appears to be a concerned, fatherly figure, a loyal retainer who worries about his young master. With a few moments of focus, however, he can shift to become a cold-blooded, patient killer.": "斯凯林简直是一个具有两种性格的人。他表面上是一个关切的、父亲般的人物，一个担心他的年轻主人的忠诚家臣。然而，只要稍加注意，他就能转变为一个冷血的、有耐心的杀手。",
	"When operating as Anders' servant, Skerrin believes that it is the duty of those with experience and wisdom to advise the young. As an assassin, he holds that those strong enough to survive flourish only by culling the weak.": "当作为安德斯的仆人时，斯凯林认为，那些有经验和智慧的人有责任为年轻人提供建议。作为一名刺客，他认为那些足够强大的人只有通过消灭弱者才能生存下去。",
	"Skerring's bond alternates between Anders and the Scarlet Brotherhood. He sees both as the best bets to bring order and security to the world.": "斯科林的纽带在安德斯和血色兄弟会之间交替出现。他认为两者都是为世界带来秩序和安全的最佳选择。",
	"Arrogance. Skerrin genuinely believes that if he had to, he could murder everyone of consequence in town in a single night and secure the place for the Scarlet Brotherhood. Sometimes he is tempted to do so, if only to prove himself right.": "傲慢。斯凯林真诚地相信，如果他不得不这样做，他可以在一个晚上杀死镇上所有重要的人，并为血色兄弟会确保这个地方。有时他很想这么做，如果只是为了证明自己是对的。",
	"The Scarlet Brotherhood is an opportunistic faction. It seeks to cause the maximum amount of disruption with the least amount of risk.": "猩红兄弟会是一个机会主义的派别。它寻求以最小的风险造成最大的破坏。",
	"The Brotherhood wants to tilt the town council in its favor and install Anders as the most prominent member. Their first goal is to find evidence of Gellan Primewater's involvement with the Sea Princes and implicate his participation in the slave trade. Such evidence is not hard to find once Gellan's dealings with the Sea Princes are revealed.": "兄弟会想让镇议会向其倾斜，并让安德斯成为最重要的成员。他们的第一个目标是找到盖兰-普里姆沃特与海王子的关系的证据，并牵扯出他参与奴隶贸易的事实。一旦盖兰与海王子的交易被揭露，这种证据并不难找到。",
	"The Brotherhood plans to use such accusations to increase tension in town between the traditionalists and the loyalists, ignite a civil war, assassinate leaders on both sides, and then use Anders as a peacemaker. Then the Brotherhood plans to assassinate Anders, frame the Sea Princes, and install Skerrin as his replacement as the town's foremost leader. Finally, Skerrin will agitate for war and continue to help Brotherhood agents infiltrate Keoland's towns in the south.": "兄弟会计划利用这样的指控来增加镇上传统派和忠诚派之间的紧张关系，点燃一场内战，暗杀双方的领导人，然后利用安德斯作为和平使者。然后，兄弟会计划刺杀安德斯，陷害海王子，并让斯凯林取代他成为镇上最重要的领导人。最后，斯凯林将鼓动战争，并继续帮助兄弟会的特工渗透到南部的基奥兰镇。",
	"If war does erupt, Brotherhood agents will work to ensure a long, drawn-out stalemate that grinds down both sides. Ideally, assassinations will pave the way for Brotherhood agents to assume high positions in both realms, but if necessary, the Brotherhood will engage armies of mercenaries, humanoid tribes, and fanatics it has gathered to finish the job. They hope that the Sea Princes can then be transformed into a puppet state, allowing the Brotherhood to turn their attention to the rest of Keoland.": "如果战争真的爆发了，兄弟会的特工将努力确保一个长期、持久的僵局，使双方都被拖垮。理想情况下，暗杀将为兄弟会特工在两个王国中担任高级职位铺平道路，但如果有必要，兄弟会将动用它所聚集的雇佣兵、人形部落和狂热者的军队来完成工作。他们希望海族王子能被改造成一个傀儡国家，让兄弟会把注意力转移到基奥兰的其他地方。",
	"The Brotherhood slips evidence of smuggling to the guard, causing several popular fishing boat owners to be arrested.": "兄弟会将走私的证据塞给警卫队，导致几个受欢迎的渔船主被逮捕。",
	"The Brotherhood's agents spread rumors that the mine is on the verge of failure and the crown plans to award the dwarves rulership of Saltmarsh as compensation.": "兄弟会的代理人散布谣言说，矿场濒临失败，王室计划授予矮人统治萨尔马什的权利作为补偿。",

	"Tainted grain delivered by a merchant in league with the Brotherhood leads to an outbreak of plague.": "一个与兄弟会结盟的商人运送的受污染的粮食导致了瘟疫的爆发。",
	"The Brotherhood uses kidnapping, blackmail, or other sinister means to turn an important member of another faction into an ally.": "兄弟会利用绑架、勒索或其他阴险手段，将另一派系的重要成员变成盟友。",
	"A small band of escaped slaves arrives in town. They claim that several sailors at the docks once worked as slave traders, prompting outraged calls for justice from Anders.": "一小群逃亡的奴隶来到了镇上。他们声称码头上的几个水手曾经是奴隶贩子，这引起了安德斯的愤怒，要求伸张正义。",
	"Pirate activity increases, bearing the unmistakable mark of the Sea Princes. The Brotherhood's ships adopt Sea Prince regalia to confuse the issue.": "海盗活动增加，带有明显的海洋王子的标志。兄弟会的船只采用海王子的服装来混淆视听。",
	"Skerrin, growing bored and overconfident, assassinates a prominent member of a faction and tries to frame the Sea Princes for the deed.": "斯凯林越来越无聊，也越来越自信，他刺杀了一个派别的重要成员，并试图将这一行为嫁祸给海王子。",
	"Saltmarsh's roughly five thousand residents are predominantly human, with the dwarven mining contingent of about two hundred workers the largest non-human faction in town. Elves and halflings draw no special notice, since the Silverstand hosts a wood elf enclave and a few halfling villages are tucked in the hills around town. The residents react to other visitors, especially tieflings and dragonborn, with a mixture of curiosity and fear.": "萨尔马什的大约五千名居民主要是人类，矮人采矿队的大约两百名工人是镇上最大的非人类派别。精灵和半身人没有引起特别的注意，因为银台有一块木精灵的飞地，而一些半身人的村庄就藏在镇子周围的山上。居民们对其他访客的反应，尤其是铁皮人和龙裔，是好奇和恐惧的混合。",
	"Saltmarsh is a bastion of civilization in the midst of an untamed region. Without its stout defenders, it might have long ago fallen to the depredations of outsiders.": "萨尔马什是野蛮地区中的一个文明堡垒。如果没有坚强的保卫者，它可能早就沦为外来者的掠夺品了。",
	"One hundred trained warriors serve in the town guard. Each of them wears studded leather armor marked with a town guard's badge—the green reed of Saltmarsh—and is armed with a club while patrolling in town. The guards work in pairs, operating from two guardhouses built near the road into Saltmarsh. A smaller station at the docks quells the fights that break out there nightly. The captain of the town guard is Eliander Fireborn.": "一百名训练有素的战士在镇卫队中服务。他们中的每一个人都穿着镶有钉子的皮甲，上面标有城镇卫队的徽章--萨尔特马什的绿色芦苇，在镇上巡逻时，他们都带着棍棒。卫兵们成双成对地工作，在进入萨尔马什的道路附近建造的两个卫兵室里工作。码头上有一个较小的站，负责平息每晚在那里发生的争斗。镇守卫队的队长是埃利安德-弗尔邦。",
	"The guard also patrols the area around Saltmarsh on horseback. Groups assigned to this duty are more heavily armed and armored; they wear chain mail and wield longswords and heavy crossbows.": "警卫队还在萨尔马什周围地区骑马巡逻。被分配到这一职责的群体拥有更多的武器和装甲；他们穿着链式盔甲，挥舞着长剑和重型弩箭。",
	"A militia of five hundred residents can be mustered to take up the defense of the town if it comes under attack. The militia members have undergone minimal training, since they are expected only to keep an enemy at bay until the king's forces arrive.": "一支由500名居民组成的民兵队可以在城镇受到攻击时承担起防御任务。民兵们接受了最低限度的训练，因为他们只被期望在国王的部队到达之前阻止敌人的入侵。",
	"A small force of marines watches over the docks and, if needed, can take to sea to meet the threat of a pirate ship or sahuagin incursion. The marines are hardened veterans of several battles against the Sea Princes. They are led by a married couple, Tom and Will Stoutly, veterans who have fought dozens of engagements against pirates, raiders, and monsters.": "一支小规模的海军陆战队监视着码头，如果需要，可以出海应对海盗船或萨瓦金人的入侵威胁。这些海军陆战队员都是在与海族王子的几次战斗中表现出色的老兵。他们由一对夫妇领导，汤姆和威尔-斯托特利，这些老兵曾与海盗、袭击者和怪物进行过数十次交战。",
	"The guard is seen as something of a meddlesome force, since most of its members are drawn from the military veterans who migrated here with the crown's blessing. Townsfolk tend to see them as brutish thugs, though they are quick to call them when trouble arises.": "警卫队被认为是一支爱管闲事的部队，因为它的大部分成员都是在王室的祝福下移民到这里的退伍军人。镇民们倾向于将他们视为野蛮的暴徒，尽管当麻烦出现时他们会迅速召集他们。",
	"The town guard arrests lawbreakers and imprisons them in the town jail. In most cases, criminals pay a fine and are let go. Those who cannot pay are required to work off their debt, usually put to work sweeping streets or helping with construction projects. If a crime requires a trial, the town council hears evidence and renders a verdict. Crime breaks down into three basic categories in Saltmarsh.": "镇上的卫兵逮捕违法者并将他们关进镇上的监狱。在大多数情况下，罪犯缴纳罚款后被释放。那些无力支付的人被要求以工代赈，通常被安排清扫街道或帮助建筑项目的工作。如果犯罪需要审判，镇议会将听取证据并作出裁决。在萨尔马什，犯罪可分为三个基本类别。",
	"Public unarmed brawling, pickpocketing, and other crimes that cause up to 50 gp in property damages are classified as petty crimes. The accused pays a fine of {@dice 2d6} gp, or one day of hard labor per gold piece owed.": "公共场合徒手斗殴、扒窃以及其他造成50金币以下财产损失的犯罪行为被归为轻罪。被告人要支付{@dice 2d6}金币的罚款，或者每欠一个金币要做一天的苦工。",
	"Armed assault, defined as any nonfatal attack made with a weapon, along with any other assault or property crimes that cause more than 50 gp in damages, but less than 250 gp, are minor crimes. The perpetrator must pay a fine of 100 gp and serve {@dice 1d4} years in prison or at forced labor.": "武装攻击，定义为任何用武器进行的非致命攻击，以及任何其他攻击或财产犯罪，造成的损失超过50戈比，但低于250戈比，都是轻罪。犯罪者必须支付100戈比的罚款，并在监狱或强制劳动中服刑（%0%）年。",
	"Crimes more severe than those outlined above, including murder, are major crimes. The criminal faces {@dice 2d10} years of imprisonment, though serious cases earn the death penalty. In most instances, these crimes are dealt with in Seaton, the provincial capital located east of Saltmarsh.": "比上述罪行更严重的罪行，包括谋杀，属于重大犯罪。罪犯将面临{@dice 2d10}年的监禁，尽管严重的案件会被判处死刑。在大多数情况下，这些罪行是在西顿处理的，西顿是位于萨尔马什东部的省会。",
	"Saltmarsh might be encrusted in sea salt and reek of rotting {@creature fish|GoS} guts, but there is gold aplenty in the coffers of its citizens. For more than a century, the ships of Saltmarsh have worked the rich fishing grounds along the coast. Trade ships from near and far have been using the docks to unload their goods, and lately more ships have come to call as the dwarven mining operation grows. Smuggling has also long been a profitable business here.": "萨尔马什可能被海盐包裹着，散发着腐烂(%0)的内脏的气味，但其公民的国库里有大量的黄金。一个多世纪以来，萨尔马什的船只一直在沿海丰富的渔场工作。来自远近的贸易船只一直在使用码头卸货，最近随着矮人采矿业的发展，更多的船只前来停靠。走私也一直是这里的一项有利可图的业务。",
	"The dwarven mining operation promises to bring about a rapid growth in Saltmarsh's fortunes. Whether that's a good or a bad thing depends on who you ask. The merchants look forward to more business, but the fishers don't see how the mines will do anything to enrich their coffers. If anything, they fear that competition for {@creature fish|GoS} will become more ferocious as the town grows.": "矮人的采矿作业有望为萨尔马什的财富带来快速增长。这到底是好事还是坏事，取决于你问谁。商人们期待着更多的生意，但渔民们不认为矿场会给他们的国库带来什么好处。如果有的话，他们担心，随着城镇的发展，对（%0%）的竞争会变得更加激烈。",
	"More folk in town work in the fishing industry than any other, and it has been the backbone of Saltmarsh for generations. The wealthier families own their own boats, while less well-to-do folk hire out to work as deckhands. The work is difficult and dangerous, but a smart deckhand can save money for several years and eventually buy their own boat. That promise of earned prosperity is important to the townsfolk, and they see newcomers as a threat to it.": "镇上从事捕鱼业的人比其他任何行业都多，而且世代都是萨尔马什的支柱产业。较富裕的家庭拥有自己的船，而不太富裕的人则雇人当水手。这项工作既困难又危险，但聪明的水手可以存几年钱，最终买下自己的船。赚取繁荣的承诺对镇民来说很重要，他们认为新来者是对它的威胁。",
	"The wealthiest families in town own large trading vessels that they use to ship goods across the Azure Sea. Saltmarsh exports other foodstuffs from the farms around town. Most manufactured goods, except for rope, nets, and other items created locally to support the fishing industry, are imported into town.": "镇上最富有的家庭拥有大型贸易船只，他们用这些船只将货物运过蔚蓝海。萨尔马什从镇子周围的农场出口其他食品。除了绳索、渔网和其他为支持捕鱼业而在当地创造的物品外，大多数制成品都是进口到镇上。",
	"As a sleepy backwater town, Saltmarsh has long been an ideal market for illegal goods. Pirates, agents of the Sea Princes, and Keoish nobles looking to evade the king's taxes have all helped fuel a bustling local black market. Some fishing boats meet ships at sea to load and unload illegal goods, while other cartels conduct business at isolated points along the shore near town. The locals see smuggling as a victimless crime and resent the crown's growing insistence on cracking down on it.": "作为一个沉睡的落后小镇，萨尔马什长期以来一直是非法货物的理想市场。海盗、海王子的代理人以及希望逃避国王税收的凯奥什贵族，都为当地热闹的黑市提供了帮助。一些渔船在海上与船只相遇，装卸非法货物，而其他卡特尔则在城镇附近的海岸边的孤立点进行交易。当地人认为走私是一种无害的犯罪，并对王室日益坚持打击走私的做法感到不满。",
	"The mine outside town is a new development. Despite the skepticism of the locals, the mine has started to yield silver in growing quantities, and the dwarves are convinced that the nearby cliffs are rich with gold. If the mine takes off, Saltmarsh could transform into a sprawling boomtown overnight.": "镇外的矿场是一个新的发展。尽管当地人持怀疑态度，但矿场已经开始产出越来越多的银，而且矮人相信附近的悬崖上有丰富的黄金。如果矿场起飞，萨尔马什可能在一夜之间转变为一个无垠的繁荣小镇。",
	"The docks of Saltmarsh are the beating heart of the town. The fishing trade and related commerce that keep the town alive are based here.": "萨尔马什的码头是该镇的心脏。保持小镇活力的渔业贸易和相关商业都在这里进行。",
	"The docks have recently undergone a series of expansions intended to lure larger merchant vessels into the port. Two primary piers are used to load and unload large ships, while a series of smaller ones accommodate humbler vessels.": "码头最近经历了一系列的扩建，旨在吸引大型商船进入港口。两个主要码头用于装卸大船，而一系列较小的码头则用于容纳较小的船只。",

Guarded warehouses are a common sight in this district, and it is considered suspicious behavior to walk near those places at night.": "萨尔马什的这一部分几乎一直都很繁忙；很少看到大型码头无人居住。守卫的仓库是这个地区常见的景象，晚上在这些地方附近行走被认为是可疑的行为。",
	"The docks are a hotbed of rumors and gossip. The sailors and laborers who frequent this area are bored, eager for news, and inclined to share what they have heard. A character who spends a few hours asking for news can learn the current scuttlebutt. The \"Dock Rumors\" table below can be an inspiration for the sort of whispers characters might hear.": "码头是谣言和八卦的温床。经常来这里的水手和工人都很无聊，渴望得到消息，并倾向于分享他们所听到的。一个花了几个小时打听消息的角色可以了解当前的小道消息。下面的 \"码头流言 \"表可以为角色可能听到的小道消息提供灵感。",
	"The crown dispatched a caravan with enough gold to commission six new warships. It went missing near the Hool Marshes.": "王室派遣了一支商队，带着足够的黄金来委托建造六艘新战舰。它在胡尔沼泽附近失踪。",

	"It's only a matter of time before the dwarves dig too deep and unleash something horrible.": "矮人挖得太深，释放出可怕的东西，这只是时间问题。",
	"Saltmarsh is a place of constant energy. Few of the common folk are so affluent that they can afford to sit idle. At sunrise, the docks bustle with fishers preparing to venture out for the day. When they return, they spend time unloading their catch, mending nets, and repairing their vessels. The merchants move their ships into the docks once the fishing fleet is out for the day, and dock workers rush to load and unload goods before the boats return.": "萨尔马什是一个能量不断的地方。很少有平民百姓能富裕到坐得住的地步。日出时分，码头上熙熙攘攘，渔民们准备出海捕鱼，度过一天。当他们回来时，他们会花时间卸下渔获物，修补渔网，并修理船只。一旦渔船队出海，商人们就把他们的船开进码头，而码头工人则赶在渔船返回之前装卸货物。",
	"The daily energy and bustle carries over into rowdy nights. The fishers chug ale and swap stories, each seeking to outdo the other with their tales of the sea. Fights erupt as rival crews cross paths, and the town guard keeps a high profile in hopes of maintaining the peace.": "每天的活力和喧嚣延续到了夜晚的狂欢。渔民们喝着啤酒，交换着故事，每个人都想用他们的海洋故事来超越对方。敌对的渔民们交头接耳，争吵不休，而镇上的卫兵则保持高调，希望能维持和平。",
	"The quantity and quality of the catch in recent days goes a long way toward determining the town's mood and general atmosphere. A bountiful catch for a few days in a row puts all the fishers in a celebratory mood, while a poor harvest that lasts more than a couple of days leads to frayed tempers and brawling.": "最近几天渔获的数量和质量在很大程度上决定了该镇的情绪和总体氛围。连续几天的丰收使所有渔民处于庆祝的情绪中，而持续几天的歉收则会导致脾气暴躁和争吵。",

	"Saltmarsh was built on the ruins of a much older settlement, sometimes called Old Saltmarsh or the Old Harbor. One sign of this is that the town has a small stretch of wall and a single town gate secured by two or three guards. The wall is old, crumbling, and badly worn by centuries of rain and wind coming in from the Azure Sea.": "萨尔马什建在一个更古老的定居点的废墟上，有时被称为老萨尔马什或老港。这方面的一个迹象是，该镇有一小段城墙和一个由两到三个卫兵把守的单一镇门。城墙很旧，摇摇欲坠，被几个世纪以来从蔚蓝海吹来的雨水和风严重磨损。",
	"The garrison at the gate consists of older guards, those nearing retirement and unwilling or unable to walk patrols. Their eyes are sharp, and they are prone to gossip. A pull from a flask of whiskey or a few silver pieces can persuade them to provide information on recent visitors.": "门口的守卫由年长的守卫组成，他们接近退休，不愿意或不能走动巡逻。他们的眼睛很敏锐，而且很容易说闲话。用一壶威士忌或几个银币就能说服他们提供关于最近访客的信息。",
	"Built on a low hill, the Saltmarsh barracks are also its jail. It is one of the few structures in Saltmarsh with an underground level. The jailer, Kraddok Stonehorn (LG male human {@creature gladiator}), is an old comrade of Eliander. He is a stickler for the rules, and Eliander trusts him with his life.": "萨尔马什军营建在一座低矮的山上，也是其监狱。它是萨尔马什为数不多的有地下一层的建筑之一。狱卒克拉多克-石角（LG男性人类（%0%））是伊莱恩德的一个老战友。他是个遵守规则的人，埃利安德把自己的生命托付给他。",
	"The jail in the cellar consists of two sections. A single large chamber holds drunks, brawling fishers, and other troublemakers who need to cool off for a few nights. The lock is high quality (requiring a successful DC 20 Dexterity check with thieves' tools to pick), and the door is built of stout wood with a small window to allow guards to check in on their charges.": "地窖里的监狱由两部分组成。一个大房间关押着醉汉、争吵的渔民和其他需要冷静几晚的麻烦制造者。锁的质量很高（需要用盗贼的工具成功地进行DC20的灵巧检查才能撬开），门是用坚固的木头建造的，有一个小窗，可以让守卫检查他们的指控。",
	"A side passage holds six individual cells with higher-quality locks (each requiring a successful DC 25 Dexterity check with thieves' tools to pick) and solid doors that lack windows.

The jump is usually not fatal; the water below the Leap is free of rocks, and it is a short swim back to dry land.": "传统上，当有亲人在海上溺水时，萨尔马什的人们会从悬崖上跳到下面的水中。这一跳通常并不致命；跃下的水面上没有岩石，而且只要游回干地就可以了。",
	"Services at this long-standing sea god's temple are well attended. The congregation is led by a one-legged former whaler: Wellgar Brinehanded (CG male human {@creature priest}), an older human man with a sharp memory for every storm, lost ship, and enormous catch ever brought into Saltmarsh harbor. He knows many fanciful stories of shipwrecks, lucky escapes, and famous captains. Matters ashore rarely interest him, but the temple and its bell tower are also served by a half-dozen novitiates and laypeople who keep things running smoothly.": "在这个历史悠久的海神庙里，参加仪式的人很多。会众由一位独腿的前捕鲸者领导。韦尔加-布林德（CG男性人类{@creature priest}），一个年长的人类男子，对每一次风暴、失落的船只和曾经进入萨尔马什港口的巨大渔获都有着敏锐的记忆。他知道许多关于沉船、幸运逃脱和著名船长的奇特故事。他对岸上的事情很少感兴趣，但寺庙和它的钟楼也有半打的见习生和普通人，他们维持着事情的顺利进行。",

	"Procan's domain is the sea, and whatever the oceans touch, he bears witness to. His mood shifts to darkness as he witnesses a brutal murder on the docks of a squalid port, then lifts in pride as he watches a brave mariner leap into the sea and save a drowning child. Every story of the oceans courses through his mind, and he in each moment curses and blesses mortals for their endless follies, heroism, and hatreds.": "普罗坎的领域是海洋，无论海洋接触到什么，他都会见证。当他目睹一个肮脏港口的码头上发生的残酷谋杀案时，他的心情转为黑暗；当他看到一个勇敢的水手跃入海中，救起一个溺水的孩子时，他又升起了自豪感。海洋的每一个故事都在他的脑海中闪过，他在每一个时刻都在诅咒和祝福凡人的无尽的愚蠢、英雄主义和仇恨。",
	"When the sea reaches its limit at the shore, so too does Procan's power. His clerics and priests rarely venture inland, and he cares little for what happens beyond his waters. At sea, he expects sacrifices in the form of fine food, potent alcohol, or valuable treasures thrown overboard at the start of a voyage. Due to this ritual, Procan holds all treasures lost at sea as part of his domain. He curses those who plunder shipwrecks without the blessings of his clerics, dogging their steps with wretched weather until his attention is drawn elsewhere.": "当大海在岸边达到极限时，普罗坎的力量也达到了极限。他的神职人员和祭司很少到内陆去冒险，他也很少关心在他的水域之外发生的事情。在海上，他希望祭品的形式是精美的食物、烈性的酒，或者在航行开始时被扔到海里的贵重财物。由于这种仪式，普罗坎把所有在海上丢失的财宝都视为他的领域的一部分。他诅咒那些在没有他的神职人员的祝福下掠夺沉船的人，用恶劣的天气拖住他们的脚步，直到他的注意力被吸引到其他地方。",
	"Procan's clerics reflect their deity's chaotic nature. They seek omens of his moods in the weather and sky, and mirror their own demeanor to match their deity's.": "普罗坎的神职人员反映了他们神灵的混乱本性。他们从天气和天空中寻找他的情绪预兆，并以自己的行为举止来配合他们的神灵。",

	"The folk of Saltmarsh point to Seaton as an example of the fate they want to avoid. For years, Seaton was about twice as large as Saltmarsh and enjoyed prosperous fishing and shipping industries. When King Kimbertos Skotti turned his attention south to deal with the Sea Princes, his admirals chose Seaton as the location for an important military port. Today, Seaton has been transformed from a robust fishing town into a drab fortress. Seaton's harbor is heavily fortified, and a large garrison of naval ships, infantry, and cavalry serves as the primary defense point for the region.": "萨尔马什的居民指出，西顿是他们想要避免的命运的一个例子。多年来，西顿的面积大约是萨尔马什的两倍，享有繁荣的渔业和航运业。当Kimbertos Skotti国王把注意力转向南方以对付海王子时，他的海军将领们选择了西顿作为重要的军事港口所在地。今天，西顿已经从一个强大的渔镇变成了一个单调的堡垒。西顿的港口有很强的防御能力，由军舰、步兵和骑兵组成的庞大驻军是该地区的主要防御点。",
	"Duke Marik Feldren (CN male human {@creature knight}) rules over the town in his capacity of governor of the southern province that includes Seaton. King Skotti actually granted Marik's older brother, the war hero Obertus Feldren, governorship of the province. But the affable duke's reign was short-lived, for he fell ill and died a year later. The title fell to Marik, a sheltered hothead eager to surpass his brother's legend. He considers the natives of the region as cowards who hid away in their isolated villages while the north suffered its losses. He further believes that his brother, who had a genuine fondness for the local fishers and traders, was laid low by traitors in service to the Sea Princes.": "马里克-费尔德伦公爵（CN男性人类（%0%））以包括西顿在内的南部省份总督的身份统治着这个小镇。斯科蒂国王实际上授予马里克的哥哥，战争英雄奥伯特斯-费尔德伦该省的总督职位。但这位和蔼可亲的公爵的统治是短暂的，因为他生病了，一年后去世了。爵位落到了马里克手中，他是一个受人庇护的热心人，渴望超越他哥哥的传奇。他认为该地区的土著人是懦夫，他们在北方遭受损失时躲在与世隔绝的村庄里。他还认为，他的哥哥对当地的渔民和商人有真正的好感，但却被为海王子服务的叛徒打倒了。",

The Scarlet Brotherhood, for its part, is delighted by Duke Feldren's plans to keep the pot stirred.

	"One night, the tower was engulfed in a fiery green aura. A few brave folks from town investigated the tower and found it abandoned. The door at the base of the cellar stairs was covered with strange symbols and wrapped in silver chains. An explorer tried to open the door, but a jolt of lightning from the door's runes nearly killed her. Shortly afterward, strange spirits and capering fey were seen atop the tower.

	"Since then, the ruins have been largely forgotten. The exception is Keledek the Unspoken, the town wizard, who used magic to open the cellar door and found that the passages led to a hidden sea cave. He uses the cave as a meeting point for smugglers. He has recruited several {@creature Goblin||goblins} to keep watch over the place, along with a trained {@creature giant constrictor snake} he raised from a hatchling. The goblins barricaded several passages leading deeper into the dungeons after losing several of their number to {@creature Ghoul||ghouls} and {@creature Giant Rat||giant rats} that emerged from the depths.": "从那时起，这片废墟基本上被遗忘了。唯一的例外是镇上的巫师凯勒德克（Keledek the Unspoken），他用魔法打开地窖的门，发现通道通向一个隐藏的海洞。他把这个山洞作为走私者的集合点。他招募了几个{@creature Goblin||goblins}来看守这里，还有一个他从孵化出来的受训{@creature giant constrictor snake}。妖精们在被从深处冒出来的{@creature Ghoul||ghouls}和{@creature Giant Rat||giant rats}杀死后，封锁了通往地牢深处的几条通道。",

	"Long a home of horrid monsters and vicious raiders, the Dreadwood hides within its borders a multitude of terrors. Keoland maintains ranger patrols that sweep through the outer reaches of the forest periodically, while several wood elf clans dwell at its edge. The two forces are generally successful at keeping the monsters of the Dreadwood in check, but at times a threat that avoids them or overcomes them emerges to wreak havoc across the land.": "长期以来，恐惧森林是可怕的怪物和邪恶的突袭者的家园，它的边界内隐藏着众多的恐怖。Keoland维持着游侠巡逻队，定期扫荡森林的外围，而几个木精灵部族则居住在森林的边缘。这两支力量一般都能成功地控制住恐惧森林的怪物，但有时也会出现避开他们或战胜他们的威胁，在这片土地上造成严重破坏。",
	"The inner depths of the Dreadwood are a place where the planar bindings between Oerth and the Shadowfell are thin.

	"Inside the outer fringe, the forest takes on an increasingly sinister character. Even on the brightest days, the thick canopy of greenery threatens to devour the sunlight. Throughout this middle area, bright light extends no more than 20 feet from any source of illumination, with the normal area of bright light beyond that range reduced to dim light and dim light turned to darkness. Those who travel without a source of light during the day find that the thick canopy casts everything in dim light, and in some areas the growth overhead is so thick that the area below is dark.": "在外部边缘地带，森林呈现出越来越险恶的特征。即使在最明亮的日子里，厚厚的绿色树冠也有可能吞噬阳光。在整个中间区域，亮光延伸到离任何照明源不超过20英尺的地方，超过这个范围的正常亮光区域就会变成暗光，而暗光则变成黑暗。那些在白天没有光源的情况下旅行的人发现，厚厚的树冠将一切都投射在昏暗的光线中，在某些地区，头顶上的生长物非常厚，下面的区域是黑暗的。",
	"In the heart of the forest, natural light is unknown.
