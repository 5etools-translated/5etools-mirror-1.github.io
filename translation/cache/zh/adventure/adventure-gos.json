	"Saltmarsh is a nondescript fishing village tucked away on the southern coast of the Kingdom of Keoland. For several generations, Keoland was a formidable military power. Its superior cavalry and bold knights pushed the kingdom's borders outward to the north, west, and east. Each successful campaign increased both the crown's wealth and power, and each one in turn drew the kingdom's attention even farther north. The southern coastal regions of Keoland remained a backwater.": "萨尔马什是一个不起眼的渔村，隐藏在基奥兰王国的南部海岸。几代人以来，Keoland是一个强大的军事力量。它优秀的骑兵和勇敢的骑士将王国的边界向北、向西、向东推进。每一次成功的战役都增加了王室的财富和权力，而每一次战役又将王国的注意力吸引到更远的北方。Keoland的南部沿海地区仍然是一个落后的地方。",
	"The crown's benign neglect allowed piracy and banditry to flourish. Saltmarsh and similar towns kept to fishing, content to maintain a low profile and avoid governmental entanglements. Decades ago, the pirates who prowled the waters off Saltmarsh grew strong enough to create their own realm, a loose confederacy known as the Hold of the Sea Princes. With the rise of that nation came increased raids on Saltmarsh and its neighbors. The Sea Princes' raiding ships pillaged the coast for more slaves to support their growing realm, and Saltmarsh suffered heavily. The memories of those times loom heavily over the area, and the locals' hatred of the Sea Princes runs deep.": "王室的善意忽视使海盗和强盗行为得以猖獗。萨尔马什和类似的城镇一直在捕鱼，满足于保持低调，避免政府的纠缠。几十年前，在萨尔马什附近水域游荡的海盗们逐渐强大到足以创建自己的王国，一个松散的联盟，被称为 \"海王子之家\"。随着这个国家的崛起，对萨尔马什和其邻国的袭击也越来越多。海王子们的袭击船在海岸上掠夺更多的奴隶，以支持他们不断增长的王国，萨尔特马什遭受了严重的损失。那个时代的记忆深深地笼罩着这个地区，当地人对海王子的恨意也很深。",
	"In time, Keoland's victories in the north gave way to a string of defeats in which its neighbors pushed the kingdom back to its original boundaries. With the world closing in, King Kimbertos Skotti looked to the south and saw unchecked banditry and a rising pirate nation. The crown struck peace treaties with its former foes to the north, raised a navy, and dealt a sharp check to the ambitions of the Sea Princes—but the conflict is by no means over.": "随着时间的推移，Keoland在北方的胜利让位于一连串的失败，它的邻国将王国逼回了它原来的边界。随着世界的逼近，国王金伯托斯-斯科蒂向南方看去，看到了不受控制的强盗行为和一个崛起的海盗国家。王室与北方的前敌人签订了和平条约，组建了海军，并对海王子的野心进行了猛烈的打击，但冲突还没有结束。",
	"King Skotti has decreed that the pirates must be put down, the sea lanes secured, and trade cultivated. If Keoland cannot prosper as a military force, it must grow mightier as a center of trade.": "斯科蒂国王已经下令，必须镇压海盗，确保海上通道的安全，并培育贸易。如果基奥兰不能作为一支军事力量而繁荣，它就必须作为一个贸易中心而变得更加强大。",
	"Saltmarsh, remote though it might be from the center of power in Keoland, is entering a new phase of its life as it reacts to the king's plans. The crown's agents want to expand the village's port and make it a prime location for trade with the world beyond. In another recent development, a band of dwarves—bearing a decree from the king himself—have arrived and begun to excavate the hills and seaside cliffs near town, looking for precious metals. If their work bears fruit as expected, the mine stands to become a major factor in the village's—and, indeed, the entire region's—prosperity.": "萨尔马什，尽管它可能远离Keoland的权力中心，但随着对国王计划的反应，它的生活正进入一个新阶段。国王的代理人想扩大村庄的港口，使其成为与世界其他地方进行贸易的主要地点。在另一个最近的发展中，一队矮人--带着国王本人的命令--已经到达，并开始挖掘城镇附近的山丘和海边的悬崖，寻找贵重金属。如果他们的工作如期取得成果，该矿将成为该村--实际上是整个地区繁荣的一个主要因素。",
	"Naturally, not all of Saltmarsh's residents feel the same way about the recent developments in and around their community, which is the key issue that affects their lives and livelihood. Although the recent changes stand to bring new prosperity to the area, many locals don't want to see their home changed. At the same time, as an undercurrent through all the goings-on, agents of the secretive and mysterious Scarlet Brotherhood work to thwart Keoland's ambitions while advancing their own.": "自然，并不是所有Saltmarsh的居民都对他们社区内和周围的最新发展有同样的感受，这也是影响他们生活和生计的关键问题。虽然最近的变化站在为该地区带来新的繁荣，但许多当地人并不希望看到他们的家园被改变。同时，作为贯穿所有事件的暗流，秘密和神秘的血色兄弟会的代理人努力挫败基奥兰的野心，同时推进他们自己的野心。",
	"Saltmarsh's future rests in the hands of three factions that compete for supremacy. Two of the factions represent the opposing sentiments that have grown in town in recent years. The third is a secret group that seeks to undermine Saltmarsh and seize control of the region. These factions' struggles play out in the day-to-day lives of the townsfolk and the political maneuvering of Saltmarsh's town council.": "萨尔马什的未来掌握在三个争夺霸权的派别手中。其中两个派别代表了近年来在镇上发展起来的对立情绪。第三个是一个秘密组织，试图破坏萨尔马什并夺取对该地区的控制权。这些派别的斗争在镇民的日常生活和萨尔马什镇议会的政治活动中得到了体现。",
	"The traditionalist faction is an alliance of the prominent fishing families and merchants in town, along with the workers who rely on those industries for a living. The traditionalists remember the terrible times during the Sea Princes' raids and have no desire to see the crown's ambitions lead to open war. The smugglers who operate in the area tend to be traditionalists. Most pose as merchants and rely on their local contacts to move goods through the region without interference from the town guard or royal agents. Smuggling has long been an easy way to make money in Saltmarsh, and locals generally look the other way, seeing it as a victimless crime.": "传统派是由镇上著名的渔业家族和商人，以及依靠这些行业谋生的工人组成的联盟。传统派记得海王子突袭时的可怕时光，不希望看到王室的野心导致公开战争。在该地区经营的走私者往往是传统主义者。大多数人冒充商人，依靠他们在当地的关系，在不受城镇卫队或皇家特工干扰的情况下在该地区运输货物。走私长期以来一直是在萨尔马什赚钱的一个简单方法，当地人一般都睁一只眼闭一只眼，把它看作是一种无害的犯罪。",
	"The traditionalists would like to see the dwarves' mining efforts fail and interest from the north wane, so that Saltmarsh's dependable fishing trade can thrive and the smugglers in the area are left alone. They resent the intrusion of outsiders seeking to transform Saltmarsh and undoubtedly drain power from the fishing families to give to dwarves and merchants.": "传统主义者希望看到矮人的采矿工作失败，来自北方的兴趣减弱，这样萨尔马什可靠的渔业贸易就能蓬勃发展，而该地区的走私者就不会受到影响。他们憎恨外来者的入侵，试图改造萨尔马什，无疑是将权力从渔民家庭中抽出，交给矮人和商人。",
	"This faction relies on two council members for representation. Eda Oweland leads the faction and can count on Gellan Primewater to back her up. Anders Solmor is young and unpredictable, but he has supported the traditionalists' viewpoint on most issues.": "这个派别依靠两名理事会成员来代表。艾达-奥维兰领导着这一派别，可以指望盖兰-普里姆沃特支持她。安德斯-索尔莫（Anders Solmor）年轻且难以预测，但他在大多数问题上都支持传统主义者的观点。",
	"At their best, traditionalists are community-minded folk who want Saltmarsh to return to its old way of doing things, arguing that the town has survived for a century by sticking to its original priorities. They suffered mightily due to the Sea Princes' depredations and remember the days when the crown turned a blind eye to their troubles. Their loyalty to the king runs second to their desire for peace and quiet.": "传统主义者最好是有社区意识的民间人士，他们希望萨尔马什恢复其旧有的行事方式，认为该镇通过坚持其原有的优先事项，已经生存了一个世纪。他们因海王子的掠夺而遭受了巨大的损失，并记得王室对他们的麻烦视而不见的日子。他们对国王的忠诚仅次于对和平与安静的渴望。",
	"Eda (CG female human {@creature noble}) is the current senior member of the town council, as well as the owner of three large fishing boats. She has lived in Saltmarsh all her life and has been elected to the council three times. She is a gruff, pragmatic woman whose graying hair is cut short and whose face bears the marks of a life lived outdoors. Eda is keenly interested in expanding Saltmarsh's fishing industry, her sights set on a wild section of the coast where she hopes to build a new dock. She is suspicious of the dwarves' mining enterprise and doubts it will amount to much.": "艾达（CG女性人类（%0%））是目前镇议会的高级成员，同时也是三艘大渔船的船主。她一生都生活在萨尔马什，曾三次当选为议会成员。她是一个粗暴、务实的女人，她的白发被剪短，脸上有户外生活的痕迹。艾达对扩大萨尔马什的渔业非常感兴趣，她的目光投向了海岸的一个荒芜地段，希望在那里建造一个新的码头。她对矮人的采矿业心存疑虑，并怀疑它是否会有什么结果。",
	"Eda swears like a sailor when she is frustrated or angry, and the folk in town who support her appreciate her willingness to stick up for them. Despite her temper, she respects those who keep their cool. Anyone who stands up to her wins her respect. Those who try to flatter her earn her contempt.": "艾达在沮丧或愤怒时像水手一样说脏话，镇上支持她的人很欣赏她愿意为他们撑腰。尽管她的脾气不好，但她尊重那些保持冷静的人。任何站在她面前的人都能赢得她的尊重。那些试图奉承她的人则赢得她的蔑视。",
	"If anyone in town needs help, Eda is the first to volunteer. She believes community binds people together and allows them to ride out the fiercest storm.": "如果镇上有人需要帮助，艾达是第一个志愿者。她相信社区将人们联系在一起，使他们能够度过最猛烈的风暴。",
	"Saltmarsh is Eda's home. She would protect it to her dying breath and wants its people to prosper.": "萨尔马什是艾达的家。她会誓死保护它，并希望它的人民能够繁荣。",
	"Eda is suspicious of outsiders, and she is too quick to trust those familiar to her.": "艾达对外人充满怀疑，她太急于相信她熟悉的人。",
	"Gellan (NE male human {@creature noble}) is a well-spoken, dapper older gentleman with a neatly trimmed beard and a fancy wardrobe. With his cunning instincts, he has positioned his family to become the most prominent merchants in town, but he now faces an intractable problem. Gellan made his fortune through smuggling, his textile and lumber exports serving as a cover for his illegal activities. When Saltmarsh was a sleepy backwater, he could operate with impunity. Now that Saltmarsh has attracted attention from the outside world, he sees business growing more difficult and less profitable.": "盖兰（NE男性人类{@creature noble}）是一个能说会道、潇洒的老先生，有着修剪整齐的胡须和花哨的衣橱。凭借他狡猾的直觉，他将自己的家族定位为镇上最著名的商人，但他现在面临一个棘手的问题。盖兰通过走私发了财，他的纺织品和木材出口成为其非法活动的掩护。当萨尔马什还是一个沉睡的落后地区时，他可以肆无忌惮地经营。现在，萨尔马什已经吸引了外部世界的注意，他看到生意越来越难做，利润越来越低。",
	"Over the years, Gellan has cultivated relationships with a number of contacts among the Sea Princes. His ships move illicit goods, including slaves, between their realm and Keoland. Gellan takes care to keep this side of his business quiet, since any hint of involvement with slave traders would mean the end of his days in Saltmarsh, if not his life.": "多年来，盖兰与海族王子中的一些联系人培养了关系。他的船在他们的王国和基奥兰之间运送非法货物，包括奴隶。盖兰小心翼翼地对他的这部分业务保持沉默，因为任何与奴隶贩子有关的暗示都意味着他在萨尔马什的日子要结束了，如果不是他的生命。",
	"Gellan seeks to keep his smuggling cartel functioning with as little interference as possible. Having a seat on the council puts him in a perfect position to maintain his business while supporting all aspects of the traditionalists' agenda. His popularity in the faction is second only to that of Eda Oweland.": "Gellan试图在尽可能少的干扰下保持他的走私集团的运作。在议会中拥有一个席位使他处于一个完美的位置，既能维持他的生意，又能支持传统派的各方面议程。他在该派别中的声望仅次于艾达-欧文兰。",
	"Because Gellan is the wealthiest man in town, he garners a great deal of popular support from the many feasts, entertainments, and other diversions he supports with expenditures and donations. He pretends to care little for the daily functions of the council, defaulting to throw his support behind Eda's position. In truth, this deference is a ruse he uses to mask his efforts to shield his smuggling operation.": "由于盖兰是镇上最富有的人，他从许多宴会、娱乐活动和其他他用支出和捐款支持的娱乐活动中获得了大量的民众支持。他假装不关心议会的日常职能，默认自己支持艾达的立场。事实上，这种尊重是他用来掩盖他努力保护自己的走私活动的诡计。",
	"Gellan loves to play the role of the foppish dandy. He enjoys fine wine, good food, and the latest fashions. He is a patron of the arts and spends lavishly to support festivals, plays, and concerts.": "盖兰喜欢扮演轻浮的花花公子的角色。他喜欢美酒、美食和最新的时尚。他是艺术的赞助人，花钱大手大脚地支持节日、戏剧和音乐会。",
	"For Gellan, beauty and elegance are everything. He derives great enjoyment from watching the town enjoy his events.": "对盖兰来说，美丽和优雅就是一切。他从看着镇上的人享受他的活动中获得了极大的乐趣。",
	"Gellan values his reputation above all else. He wants to be admired by the people of Saltmarsh.": "盖兰把自己的声誉看得比什么都重要。他希望被萨尔马什的人们所敬仰。",
	"Greed colors every action Gellan takes. He can't turn down a chance to turn a profit, even if it means breaking the law. Gellan secretly believes that even if he is caught, he can spend his way back into the town's good graces by throwing the biggest, most extravagant festival Saltmarsh has ever seen.": "贪婪使盖伦的每一个行动都充满色彩。他不能拒绝赚钱的机会，即使这意味着违反法律。Gellan秘密地相信，即使他被抓，他也可以通过举办萨尔马什有史以来最大、最奢侈的节日来重新获得镇上的好感。",
	"The traditionalists simply want things to remain the same. If they had their way, the dwarves would go home, the guard would stick to dealing with monsters rather than hassling honest traders, and the crown would go back to dreaming of conquests in the north. The more things change, the more this faction resorts to open protest and resistance.": "传统主义者只是希望事情保持不变。如果他们有自己的方式，矮人就会回家，卫队就会坚持对付怪物而不是骚扰诚实的商人，而王室就会回去梦想在北方的征服。事情越是变化，这个派别就越是诉诸于公开抗议和抵抗。",
	"A group of fishers accosts dwarves and other outsiders, demanding they leave town or else.": "一群渔民与矮人和其他外来者搭讪，要求他们离开镇子，否则。",
	"Gellan Primewater imports a variety of exotic flowers that he uses to decorate the town, while also distributing fresh tropical fruit free of charge to the townsfolk.": "杰兰-普里姆沃特进口各种异国花卉，用来装饰小镇，同时还免费向镇民分发新鲜的热带水果。",
	"A fire breaks out in town, and Eda Oweland raises funds to support those who lost their homes.": "镇上发生了一场火灾，艾达-欧沃兰筹集资金以支持那些失去家园的人。",
	"A fishing boat goes missing with its crew. They were smuggling a haul of black pearls, and Gellan wants his treasure back without risking his cover.": "一艘渔船和它的船员失踪了。他们偷运了一批黑珍珠，盖兰想在不危及自己身份的情况下拿回他的财宝。",
	"A bountiful catch leads to a day of feasting and reconciliation, giving the factions a chance to make amends.": "丰富的收获导致了一天的盛宴与和解，给各派别一个弥补的机会。",
	"A bungled smuggling operation lands a few respected people in jail, leading to near riots as fishers gather in a huge mob to effect a breakout.": "一次失败的走私行动使一些受人尊敬的人被关进了监狱，导致渔民们聚集成巨大的暴徒来实现突围，从而导致了近乎暴乱。",
	"A horrible sea creature has been sighted, keeping many crews at the docks until it disappears. Anyone who tracks it down and slays it would be a hero. Gellan pledges a magic weapon to its slayer.": "有人发现了一种可怕的海洋生物，让许多船员在码头上呆着，直到它消失。任何追踪到它并杀死它的人都会成为英雄。Gellan将一件魔法武器承诺给它的杀手。",
	"Several fishing crews have gone missing. The locals demand that Keoland dispatch a squadron of ships to track down the slavers from the Sea Princes who surely kidnapped them.": "几名捕鱼人员失踪了。当地人要求Keoland派遣一个中队的船只去追踪肯定绑架了他们的海王子的奴隶主。",
	"The loyalists consist of newcomers who arrived from the northern reaches of Keoland, loyal to King Kimbertos Skotti. They feel that the town should focus on becoming a useful asset to the crown and value the good of the kingdom before the good of the region. The town guard, the dwarves, and the local farmers are generally loyalists.": "忠诚的人由从Keoland北部到达的新来者组成，他们忠于Kimbertos Skotti国王。他们认为该镇应该专注于成为王室的有用资产，并将王国的利益置于该地区的利益之上。镇上的卫兵、矮人和当地的农民一般都是忠诚的。",
	"The loyalists care about security. They want to keep Keoland's enemies at bay while ensuring law and order. They see smuggling as a key problem, as it enriches the Sea Princes at the cost of the royal treasury and the efforts of honest merchants.": "忠诚的人关心安全问题。他们希望在确保法律和秩序的同时，将Keoland的敌人挡在门外。他们认为走私是一个关键问题，因为它以皇家国库和诚实商人的努力为代价使海族王子发财。",
	"Above all else, the members of this faction put their faith in law. They exert influence through the town guard, though they remain within their legal authority.": "最重要的是，这个派别的成员把他们的信仰放在法律上。他们通过城镇警卫队施加影响，尽管他们仍在法律授权范围内。",
	"At their best, the loyalists want to grow Saltmarsh into a trading hub with a higher standard of living and improved security. If the Sea Princes are held in check and the sea lanes cleared of threats, Saltmarsh can grow to become the envy of the world.": "在他们最好的情况下，忠诚者希望将萨尔马什发展成一个贸易中心，拥有更高的生活水平和更好的安全。如果海王子被控制住了，海上通道的威胁被清除了，萨尔马什可以发展成为世界上令人羡慕的地方。",
	"At their worst, the loyalists see the people of Saltmarsh as a barrier to growth. The locals are little more than allies of the Sea Princes, traitors who for too long have evaded the crown's notice. If they were to do as the loyalists tell them, then perhaps this {@creature fish|GoS}-reeking pile of a town could become something respectable.": "在他们最坏的情况下，效忠者将萨尔马什的人民视为发展的障碍。当地人只不过是海王子的盟友，是长期以来躲避王室注意的叛徒。如果他们按照效忠者的要求去做，那么这个{@creature fish|GoS}臭气熏天的小镇也许会成为一个值得尊敬的地方。",
	"Eliander (LN male human {@creature gladiator}) fought in the royal army of Keoland, where he earned a name driving the wild things of the Dreadwood away from the settled lands. Eliander suffered a tremendous injury to his leg in a battle against an owlbear and now walks upon a finely carved wooden peg. Despite his injury and advancing age, the burly captain of the Saltmarsh town guard remains an imposing figure. Eliander is a local celebrity thanks to his facility with languages, and he is often called upon by the town's various organizations to assist with translations. He is fully literate in Common, Dwarvish, Gnomish, Elvish, and Halfling; he can also speak and understand Orc and Draconic.": "Eliander（LN男性人类（%0%））在Keoland的皇家军队中作战，在那里他赢得了将Dreadwood的野物从定居的土地上赶走的名声。在一次与猫头鹰熊的战斗中，埃利安德的腿部受到了巨大的伤害，现在他是在一个精雕细琢的木桩上行走的。尽管他的伤势和年龄不断增长，这位粗壮的萨尔马什镇卫队队长仍然是一个威严的人物。埃利安德是当地的名人，这要归功于他的语言能力，他经常被镇上的各种组织要求协助进行翻译。他精通普通话、矮人语、地精语、精灵语和半身人语；他还能说和听懂兽人语和龙语。",
	"In a crisis, Eliander Fireborn might put the good of the crown above local rule. He possesses a royal writ that allows him to seize authority over the town guard in case of an emergency. He is loath to use it, as the locals might react to his seizure of power with an open revolt.": "在危机中，埃利安德-弗尔邦可能会把王室的利益置于地方统治之上。他拥有一份皇室令状，允许他在紧急情况下夺取镇上卫队的权力。他不愿意使用它，因为当地人可能会对他夺取的权力做出公开的反应。",

He recognizes that Saltmarsh is on the verge of tremendous growth, but he sees the influence of the Sea Princes behind every stroke of misfortune. Slow and steady wins the day, as he likes to say.": "谨慎指导着埃利安德的思想和他的每一个行动。他认识到萨尔马什正处于巨大发展的边缘，但他看到每一次不幸的背后都有海王子的影响。正如他喜欢说的那样，缓慢而稳定地赢得今天。",

	"The leader of the newly established mining operation in Saltmarsh is an iron-willed dwarven woman named Manistrad (LN female dwarf {@creature veteran}). She runs the mining outfit from a small office near the edge of town. Manistrad is a competent leader, as well as a savvy miner with a knack for pulling off impossible jobs. She's convinced that the veins of silver found in the cliffs near Saltmarsh are indicative of more valuable stones deeper in the rock. She was once a fearsome warrior, and she's not above delivering a few well-placed blows to ensure her orders are followed.": "在萨尔马什新成立的矿业公司的领导人是一位意志坚定的矮人妇女，名叫玛尼斯特拉德（LN女矮人（%0%））。她在镇子边缘的一个小办公室里经营采矿业。玛尼斯特拉是一个称职的领导者，也是一个精明的矿工，擅长完成不可能完成的工作。她相信在萨尔马什附近的悬崖上发现的银矿脉表明在岩石深处有更有价值的石头。她曾经是一个可怕的战士，她也不忘给自己几下，以确保她的命令得到遵守。",
	"Manistrad occupies an awkward place on the council. She was placed in her position by royal decree; the crown decided that if Saltmarsh is to support a mining operation, the miners would need a political voice. A more diplomatic figure might have smoothed over the tension, but Manistrad has little patience and sees the rest of the council, save for Eliander, as rustic dullards.": "马尼斯特拉在议会中占据了一个尴尬的位置。她的职位是由皇家法令安排的；王室决定，如果萨尔马什要支持采矿作业，矿工就需要一个政治上的声音。一个更有外交手腕的人物可能会抚平紧张局势，但玛尼斯特拉却没有什么耐心，在她看来，除了埃利安德之外，议会的其他成员都是土里土气的呆子。",
	"Manistrad is a woman of few words. She is curt and quick, yet she gives every person who comes before the council a fair accounting. She's nobody's fool.": "马尼斯特拉是个寡言的女人。她说话客气而迅速，但她给每一个来到议会的人一个公平的交代。她不是任何人的傻瓜。",

	"Manistrad has little patience; she tends to push for quick results over a more measured approach.": "马尼斯特拉德没有什么耐心；她倾向于推动快速的结果，而不是更有分寸的方法。",
	"The loyalists are focused on two things: ensuring that the dwarven mine is a success, and clamping down on smuggling to keep the Sea Princes in check.

His recent forays into trade have made him a local celebrity. Since Anders owns both a fishing fleet and several trading vessels, he can sell his catch at a highly competitive price. And he can offer better prices for the other fishers in town to sell to him, since his catch brings in so much more profit.": "年轻的安德斯（LG男性人类（%0%））在他母亲佩特拉早逝后，最近继承了他家的渔船队。他是有史以来被选入议会的最年轻的人。安德斯是一个身材矮小的人，有着尖锐的特征和露齿的微笑。他最近对贸易的探索使他成为当地的名人。由于安德斯同时拥有一支捕鱼船队和几艘贸易船，他可以以极具竞争力的价格出售他的渔获。而且，他可以为镇上的其他渔民提供更好的价格，让他们卖给他，因为他的渔获带来了更多的利润。",
	"Everyone involved in the town's fishing industry supports Anders, and his energy and ambition have made him something of a folk hero on the docks. On the other hand, his open opposition to smuggling and his hatred of the Sea Princes' practice of slavery makes him a thorn in the smugglers' side.": "每个参与该镇渔业的人都支持安德斯，他的精力和雄心使他成为码头上的民间英雄。另一方面，他公开反对走私，憎恨海王子的奴隶制做法，使他成为走私者的眼中钉。",
	"Unbeknownst to Anders, his butler, Skerrin Wavechaser, is an agent for the Scarlet Brotherhood. He engineered the death of Anders' mother and has placed a number of Brotherhood agents in key positions in the Solmor fleet.": "安德斯不知道，他的管家Skerrin Wavechaser是猩红兄弟会的特工。他策划了安德斯母亲的死亡，并将一些兄弟会的特工安排在索尔摩舰队的关键位置。",
	"Anders is sunny and optimistic. He sees the potential for profit and opportunity in every challenge. Unfortunately, he is too young to temper his views with a realistic assessment of the risks.": "安德斯是阳光和乐观的。他在每一个挑战中都能看到利润和机会的潜力。不幸的是，他太年轻了，无法用对风险的现实评估来调整他的观点。",
	"Anders believes that freedom is the root of happiness. He pays his employees well and wants to help Saltmarsh grow into a prosperous town. Above all else, he hates the Sea Princes and wants to see their realm and its slave trade scoured from the earth.": "安德斯相信，自由是幸福的根源。他给员工的工资很高，希望帮助萨尔马什发展成为一个繁荣的城镇。最重要的是，他痛恨海族王子，希望看到他们的王国和奴隶贸易从地球上消失。",
	"Anders's mother Petra was the center of his life, and his sense of responsibility stems from her example. Every important decision he makes is guided by his desire to live up to her standards. If Skerrin is implicated in her murder, his hold over Anders would be shattered. For now, Skerrin uses Petra's memory to fan Anders's antipathy toward the Sea Princes.": "安德斯的母亲佩特拉是他生活的中心，他的责任感源于她的榜样。他所做的每一个重要决定都是以他希望达到她的标准为指导。如果斯凯林与她的谋杀案有牵连，他对安德斯的控制就会被打破。目前，斯凯林利用佩特拉的记忆来煽动安德斯对海族王子的反感。",
	"Due to a combination of his youth and his somewhat sheltered upbringing, Anders is naïve. He relied on his mother's expertise in most matters, which has allowed Skerrin to worm his way into Anders's confidence.": "由于年轻和他有些受庇护的成长经历，安德斯很天真。他在大多数事情上依赖他母亲的专业知识，这使得斯凯林能够以蠕虫方式进入安德斯的信心。",
	"Skerrin (LE male human {@creature assassin}) is secretly the head Brotherhood agent in town. Tall, lean, tan, with short silver hair, he speaks in precise, measured statements of a man who has a keen eye for detail. He is dispassionate and takes a protective stance toward Anders. To observers, he is nothing more than a faithful and trusted butler.": "斯凯林（LE男性人类（%0%））是镇上兄弟会的秘密头目。他身材高大，瘦削，皮肤黝黑，有一头银色的短发，说话准确，有分寸，是一个对细节有着敏锐洞察力的人。他是个冷静的人，对安德斯采取保护的态度。对于观察者来说，他只不过是一个忠实的、值得信赖的管家。",
	"Skerrin was renowned for his patience during his days as an assassin for the Brotherhood. Once, he hid himself in the attic above a noble's bedroom, waiting in a trance-like state for three days and nights until his target was positioned just below a small crack in the room's ceiling. Skerrin squeezed a single drop from a vial of poison he carried on to the noble's bald scalp. He waited in his hiding place for another full day until the contact poison killed the man.": "斯凯林在为兄弟会担任刺客的日子里，以其耐心而闻名。有一次，他把自己藏在一个贵族卧室的阁楼上，在恍惚的状态下等了三天三夜，直到他的目标被安置在房间天花板的一个小裂缝下面。斯凯林从他携带的一小瓶毒药中挤出一滴，滴在贵族的秃头皮上。他在藏身之处又等了一整天，直到接触性毒药杀死这个人。",
	"Skerrin is literally a man of two personalities. He appears to be a concerned, fatherly figure, a loyal retainer who worries about his young master. With a few moments of focus, however, he can shift to become a cold-blooded, patient killer.": "斯凯林简直是一个具有两种性格的人。他表面上是一个关切的、父亲般的人物，一个担心他的年轻主人的忠诚家臣。然而，只要稍加注意，他就能转变为一个冷血的、有耐心的杀手。",
	"When operating as Anders' servant, Skerrin believes that it is the duty of those with experience and wisdom to advise the young. As an assassin, he holds that those strong enough to survive flourish only by culling the weak.": "当作为安德斯的仆人时，斯凯林认为，那些有经验和智慧的人有责任为年轻人提供建议。作为一名刺客，他认为那些足够强大的人只有通过消灭弱者才能生存下去。",
	"Skerring's bond alternates between Anders and the Scarlet Brotherhood. He sees both as the best bets to bring order and security to the world.": "斯科林的纽带在安德斯和血色兄弟会之间交替出现。他认为两者都是为世界带来秩序和安全的最佳选择。",
	"Arrogance. Skerrin genuinely believes that if he had to, he could murder everyone of consequence in town in a single night and secure the place for the Scarlet Brotherhood. Sometimes he is tempted to do so, if only to prove himself right.": "傲慢。斯凯林真诚地相信，如果他不得不这样做，他可以在一个晚上杀死镇上所有重要的人，并为血色兄弟会确保这个地方。有时他很想这么做，如果只是为了证明自己是对的。",
	"The Scarlet Brotherhood is an opportunistic faction. It seeks to cause the maximum amount of disruption with the least amount of risk.": "猩红兄弟会是一个机会主义的派别。它寻求以最小的风险造成最大的破坏。",
	"The Brotherhood wants to tilt the town council in its favor and install Anders as the most prominent member. Their first goal is to find evidence of Gellan Primewater's involvement with the Sea Princes and implicate his participation in the slave trade. Such evidence is not hard to find once Gellan's dealings with the Sea Princes are revealed.": "兄弟会想让镇议会向其倾斜，并让安德斯成为最重要的成员。他们的第一个目标是找到盖兰-普里姆沃特与海王子的关系的证据，并牵扯出他参与奴隶贸易的事实。一旦盖兰与海王子的交易被揭露，这种证据并不难找到。",
	"The Brotherhood plans to use such accusations to increase tension in town between the traditionalists and the loyalists, ignite a civil war, assassinate leaders on both sides, and then use Anders as a peacemaker. Then the Brotherhood plans to assassinate Anders, frame the Sea Princes, and install Skerrin as his replacement as the town's foremost leader. Finally, Skerrin will agitate for war and continue to help Brotherhood agents infiltrate Keoland's towns in the south.": "兄弟会计划利用这样的指控来增加镇上传统派和忠诚派之间的紧张关系，点燃一场内战，暗杀双方的领导人，然后利用安德斯作为和平使者。然后，兄弟会计划刺杀安德斯，陷害海王子，并让斯凯林取代他成为镇上最重要的领导人。最后，斯凯林将鼓动战争，并继续帮助兄弟会的特工渗透到南部的基奥兰镇。",
	"If war does erupt, Brotherhood agents will work to ensure a long, drawn-out stalemate that grinds down both sides. Ideally, assassinations will pave the way for Brotherhood agents to assume high positions in both realms, but if necessary, the Brotherhood will engage armies of mercenaries, humanoid tribes, and fanatics it has gathered to finish the job. They hope that the Sea Princes can then be transformed into a puppet state, allowing the Brotherhood to turn their attention to the rest of Keoland.": "如果战争真的爆发了，兄弟会的特工将努力确保一个长期、持久的僵局，使双方都被拖垮。理想情况下，暗杀将为兄弟会特工在两个王国中担任高级职位铺平道路，但如果有必要，兄弟会将动用它所聚集的雇佣兵、人形部落和狂热者的军队来完成工作。他们希望海族王子能被改造成一个傀儡国家，让兄弟会把注意力转移到基奥兰的其他地方。",
	"The Brotherhood slips evidence of smuggling to the guard, causing several popular fishing boat owners to be arrested.": "兄弟会将走私的证据塞给警卫队，导致几个受欢迎的渔船主被逮捕。",
	"The Brotherhood's agents spread rumors that the mine is on the verge of failure and the crown plans to award the dwarves rulership of Saltmarsh as compensation.": "兄弟会的代理人散布谣言说，矿场濒临失败，王室计划授予矮人统治萨尔马什的权利作为补偿。",

	"Tainted grain delivered by a merchant in league with the Brotherhood leads to an outbreak of plague.": "一个与兄弟会结盟的商人运送的受污染的粮食导致了瘟疫的爆发。",
	"The Brotherhood uses kidnapping, blackmail, or other sinister means to turn an important member of another faction into an ally.": "兄弟会利用绑架、勒索或其他阴险手段，将另一派系的重要成员变成盟友。",
	"A small band of escaped slaves arrives in town. They claim that several sailors at the docks once worked as slave traders, prompting outraged calls for justice from Anders.": "一小群逃亡的奴隶来到了镇上。他们声称码头上的几个水手曾经是奴隶贩子，这引起了安德斯的愤怒，要求伸张正义。",
	"Pirate activity increases, bearing the unmistakable mark of the Sea Princes. The Brotherhood's ships adopt Sea Prince regalia to confuse the issue.": "海盗活动增加，带有明显的海洋王子的标志。兄弟会的船只采用海王子的服装来混淆视听。",
	"Skerrin, growing bored and overconfident, assassinates a prominent member of a faction and tries to frame the Sea Princes for the deed.": "斯凯林越来越无聊，也越来越自信，他刺杀了一个派别的重要成员，并试图将这一行为嫁祸给海王子。",
	"Saltmarsh's roughly five thousand residents are predominantly human, with the dwarven mining contingent of about two hundred workers the largest non-human faction in town. Elves and halflings draw no special notice, since the Silverstand hosts a wood elf enclave and a few halfling villages are tucked in the hills around town. The residents react to other visitors, especially tieflings and dragonborn, with a mixture of curiosity and fear.": "萨尔马什的大约五千名居民主要是人类，矮人采矿队的大约两百名工人是镇上最大的非人类派别。精灵和半身人没有引起特别的注意，因为银台有一块木精灵的飞地，而一些半身人的村庄就藏在镇子周围的山上。居民们对其他访客的反应，尤其是铁皮人和龙裔，是好奇和恐惧的混合。",
	"Saltmarsh is a bastion of civilization in the midst of an untamed region. Without its stout defenders, it might have long ago fallen to the depredations of outsiders.": "萨尔马什是野蛮地区中的一个文明堡垒。如果没有坚强的保卫者，它可能早就沦为外来者的掠夺品了。",
	"One hundred trained warriors serve in the town guard. Each of them wears studded leather armor marked with a town guard's badge—the green reed of Saltmarsh—and is armed with a club while patrolling in town. The guards work in pairs, operating from two guardhouses built near the road into Saltmarsh. A smaller station at the docks quells the fights that break out there nightly. The captain of the town guard is Eliander Fireborn.": "一百名训练有素的战士在镇卫队中服务。他们中的每一个人都穿着镶有钉子的皮甲，上面标有城镇卫队的徽章--萨尔特马什的绿色芦苇，在镇上巡逻时，他们都带着棍棒。卫兵们成双成对地工作，在进入萨尔马什的道路附近建造的两个卫兵室里工作。码头上有一个较小的站，负责平息每晚在那里发生的争斗。镇守卫队的队长是埃利安德-弗尔邦。",
	"The guard also patrols the area around Saltmarsh on horseback. Groups assigned to this duty are more heavily armed and armored; they wear chain mail and wield longswords and heavy crossbows.": "警卫队还在萨尔马什周围地区骑马巡逻。被分配到这一职责的群体拥有更多的武器和装甲；他们穿着链式盔甲，挥舞着长剑和重型弩箭。",
	"A militia of five hundred residents can be mustered to take up the defense of the town if it comes under attack. The militia members have undergone minimal training, since they are expected only to keep an enemy at bay until the king's forces arrive.": "一支由500名居民组成的民兵队可以在城镇受到攻击时承担起防御任务。民兵们接受了最低限度的训练，因为他们只被期望在国王的部队到达之前阻止敌人的入侵。",
	"A small force of marines watches over the docks and, if needed, can take to sea to meet the threat of a pirate ship or sahuagin incursion. The marines are hardened veterans of several battles against the Sea Princes. They are led by a married couple, Tom and Will Stoutly, veterans who have fought dozens of engagements against pirates, raiders, and monsters.": "一支小规模的海军陆战队监视着码头，如果需要，可以出海应对海盗船或萨瓦金人的入侵威胁。这些海军陆战队员都是在与海族王子的几次战斗中表现出色的老兵。他们由一对夫妇领导，汤姆和威尔-斯托特利，这些老兵曾与海盗、袭击者和怪物进行过数十次交战。",
	"The guard is seen as something of a meddlesome force, since most of its members are drawn from the military veterans who migrated here with the crown's blessing. Townsfolk tend to see them as brutish thugs, though they are quick to call them when trouble arises.": "警卫队被认为是一支爱管闲事的部队，因为它的大部分成员都是在王室的祝福下移民到这里的退伍军人。镇民们倾向于将他们视为野蛮的暴徒，尽管当麻烦出现时他们会迅速召集他们。",
	"The town guard arrests lawbreakers and imprisons them in the town jail. In most cases, criminals pay a fine and are let go. Those who cannot pay are required to work off their debt, usually put to work sweeping streets or helping with construction projects. If a crime requires a trial, the town council hears evidence and renders a verdict. Crime breaks down into three basic categories in Saltmarsh.": "镇上的卫兵逮捕违法者并将他们关进镇上的监狱。在大多数情况下，罪犯缴纳罚款后被释放。那些无力支付的人被要求以工代赈，通常被安排清扫街道或帮助建筑项目的工作。如果犯罪需要审判，镇议会将听取证据并作出裁决。在萨尔马什，犯罪可分为三个基本类别。",
	"Public unarmed brawling, pickpocketing, and other crimes that cause up to 50 gp in property damages are classified as petty crimes. The accused pays a fine of {@dice 2d6} gp, or one day of hard labor per gold piece owed.": "公共场合徒手斗殴、扒窃以及其他造成50金币以下财产损失的犯罪行为被归为轻罪。被告人要支付{@dice 2d6}金币的罚款，或者每欠一个金币要做一天的苦工。",
	"Armed assault, defined as any nonfatal attack made with a weapon, along with any other assault or property crimes that cause more than 50 gp in damages, but less than 250 gp, are minor crimes. The perpetrator must pay a fine of 100 gp and serve {@dice 1d4} years in prison or at forced labor.": "武装攻击，定义为任何用武器进行的非致命攻击，以及任何其他攻击或财产犯罪，造成的损失超过50戈比，但低于250戈比，都是轻罪。犯罪者必须支付100戈比的罚款，并在监狱或强制劳动中服刑（%0%）年。",
	"Crimes more severe than those outlined above, including murder, are major crimes. The criminal faces {@dice 2d10} years of imprisonment, though serious cases earn the death penalty. In most instances, these crimes are dealt with in Seaton, the provincial capital located east of Saltmarsh.": "比上述罪行更严重的罪行，包括谋杀，属于重大犯罪。罪犯将面临{@dice 2d10}年的监禁，尽管严重的案件会被判处死刑。在大多数情况下，这些罪行是在西顿处理的，西顿是位于萨尔马什东部的省会。",
	"Saltmarsh might be encrusted in sea salt and reek of rotting {@creature fish|GoS} guts, but there is gold aplenty in the coffers of its citizens. For more than a century, the ships of Saltmarsh have worked the rich fishing grounds along the coast. Trade ships from near and far have been using the docks to unload their goods, and lately more ships have come to call as the dwarven mining operation grows. Smuggling has also long been a profitable business here.": "萨尔马什可能被海盐包裹着，散发着腐烂(%0)的内脏的气味，但其公民的国库里有大量的黄金。一个多世纪以来，萨尔马什的船只一直在沿海丰富的渔场工作。来自远近的贸易船只一直在使用码头卸货，最近随着矮人采矿业的发展，更多的船只前来停靠。走私也一直是这里的一项有利可图的业务。",
	"The dwarven mining operation promises to bring about a rapid growth in Saltmarsh's fortunes. Whether that's a good or a bad thing depends on who you ask. The merchants look forward to more business, but the fishers don't see how the mines will do anything to enrich their coffers. If anything, they fear that competition for {@creature fish|GoS} will become more ferocious as the town grows.": "矮人的采矿作业有望为萨尔马什的财富带来快速增长。这到底是好事还是坏事，取决于你问谁。商人们期待着更多的生意，但渔民们不认为矿场会给他们的国库带来什么好处。如果有的话，他们担心，随着城镇的发展，对（%0%）的竞争会变得更加激烈。",
	"More folk in town work in the fishing industry than any other, and it has been the backbone of Saltmarsh for generations. The wealthier families own their own boats, while less well-to-do folk hire out to work as deckhands. The work is difficult and dangerous, but a smart deckhand can save money for several years and eventually buy their own boat. That promise of earned prosperity is important to the townsfolk, and they see newcomers as a threat to it.": "镇上从事捕鱼业的人比其他任何行业都多，而且世代都是萨尔马什的支柱产业。较富裕的家庭拥有自己的船，而不太富裕的人则雇人当水手。这项工作既困难又危险，但聪明的水手可以存几年钱，最终买下自己的船。赚取繁荣的承诺对镇民来说很重要，他们认为新来者是对它的威胁。",
	"The wealthiest families in town own large trading vessels that they use to ship goods across the Azure Sea. Saltmarsh exports other foodstuffs from the farms around town. Most manufactured goods, except for rope, nets, and other items created locally to support the fishing industry, are imported into town.": "镇上最富有的家庭拥有大型贸易船只，他们用这些船只将货物运过蔚蓝海。萨尔马什从镇子周围的农场出口其他食品。除了绳索、渔网和其他为支持捕鱼业而在当地创造的物品外，大多数制成品都是进口到镇上。",
	"As a sleepy backwater town, Saltmarsh has long been an ideal market for illegal goods. Pirates, agents of the Sea Princes, and Keoish nobles looking to evade the king's taxes have all helped fuel a bustling local black market. Some fishing boats meet ships at sea to load and unload illegal goods, while other cartels conduct business at isolated points along the shore near town. The locals see smuggling as a victimless crime and resent the crown's growing insistence on cracking down on it.": "作为一个沉睡的落后小镇，萨尔马什长期以来一直是非法货物的理想市场。海盗、海王子的代理人以及希望逃避国王税收的凯奥什贵族，都为当地热闹的黑市提供了帮助。一些渔船在海上与船只相遇，装卸非法货物，而其他卡特尔则在城镇附近的海岸边的孤立点进行交易。当地人认为走私是一种无害的犯罪，并对王室日益坚持打击走私的做法感到不满。",
	"The mine outside town is a new development. Despite the skepticism of the locals, the mine has started to yield silver in growing quantities, and the dwarves are convinced that the nearby cliffs are rich with gold. If the mine takes off, Saltmarsh could transform into a sprawling boomtown overnight.": "镇外的矿场是一个新的发展。尽管当地人持怀疑态度，但矿场已经开始产出越来越多的银，而且矮人相信附近的悬崖上有丰富的黄金。如果矿场起飞，萨尔马什可能在一夜之间转变为一个无垠的繁荣小镇。",
	"The docks of Saltmarsh are the beating heart of the town. The fishing trade and related commerce that keep the town alive are based here.": "萨尔马什的码头是该镇的心脏。保持小镇活力的渔业贸易和相关商业都在这里进行。",
	"The docks have recently undergone a series of expansions intended to lure larger merchant vessels into the port. Two primary piers are used to load and unload large ships, while a series of smaller ones accommodate humbler vessels.": "码头最近经历了一系列的扩建，旨在吸引大型商船进入港口。两个主要码头用于装卸大船，而一系列较小的码头则用于容纳较小的船只。",

Guarded warehouses are a common sight in this district, and it is considered suspicious behavior to walk near those places at night.": "萨尔马什的这一部分几乎一直都很繁忙；很少看到大型码头无人居住。守卫的仓库是这个地区常见的景象，晚上在这些地方附近行走被认为是可疑的行为。",
	"The docks are a hotbed of rumors and gossip. The sailors and laborers who frequent this area are bored, eager for news, and inclined to share what they have heard. A character who spends a few hours asking for news can learn the current scuttlebutt. The \"Dock Rumors\" table below can be an inspiration for the sort of whispers characters might hear.": "码头是谣言和八卦的温床。经常来这里的水手和工人都很无聊，渴望得到消息，并倾向于分享他们所听到的。一个花了几个小时打听消息的角色可以了解当前的小道消息。下面的 \"码头流言 \"表可以为角色可能听到的小道消息提供灵感。",
	"The crown dispatched a caravan with enough gold to commission six new warships. It went missing near the Hool Marshes.": "王室派遣了一支商队，带着足够的黄金来委托建造六艘新战舰。它在胡尔沼泽附近失踪。",

	"It's only a matter of time before the dwarves dig too deep and unleash something horrible.": "矮人挖得太深，释放出可怕的东西，这只是时间问题。",
	"Saltmarsh is a place of constant energy. Few of the common folk are so affluent that they can afford to sit idle. At sunrise, the docks bustle with fishers preparing to venture out for the day. When they return, they spend time unloading their catch, mending nets, and repairing their vessels. The merchants move their ships into the docks once the fishing fleet is out for the day, and dock workers rush to load and unload goods before the boats return.": "萨尔马什是一个能量不断的地方。很少有平民百姓能富裕到坐得住的地步。日出时分，码头上熙熙攘攘，渔民们准备出海捕鱼，度过一天。当他们回来时，他们会花时间卸下渔获物，修补渔网，并修理船只。一旦渔船队出海，商人们就把他们的船开进码头，而码头工人则赶在渔船返回之前装卸货物。",
	"The daily energy and bustle carries over into rowdy nights. The fishers chug ale and swap stories, each seeking to outdo the other with their tales of the sea. Fights erupt as rival crews cross paths, and the town guard keeps a high profile in hopes of maintaining the peace.": "每天的活力和喧嚣延续到了夜晚的狂欢。渔民们喝着啤酒，交换着故事，每个人都想用他们的海洋故事来超越对方。敌对的渔民们交头接耳，争吵不休，而镇上的卫兵则保持高调，希望能维持和平。",
	"The quantity and quality of the catch in recent days goes a long way toward determining the town's mood and general atmosphere. A bountiful catch for a few days in a row puts all the fishers in a celebratory mood, while a poor harvest that lasts more than a couple of days leads to frayed tempers and brawling.": "最近几天渔获的数量和质量在很大程度上决定了该镇的情绪和总体氛围。连续几天的丰收使所有渔民处于庆祝的情绪中，而持续几天的歉收则会导致脾气暴躁和争吵。",

	"Saltmarsh was built on the ruins of a much older settlement, sometimes called Old Saltmarsh or the Old Harbor. One sign of this is that the town has a small stretch of wall and a single town gate secured by two or three guards. The wall is old, crumbling, and badly worn by centuries of rain and wind coming in from the Azure Sea.": "萨尔马什建在一个更古老的定居点的废墟上，有时被称为老萨尔马什或老港。这方面的一个迹象是，该镇有一小段城墙和一个由两到三个卫兵把守的单一镇门。城墙很旧，摇摇欲坠，被几个世纪以来从蔚蓝海吹来的雨水和风严重磨损。",
	"The garrison at the gate consists of older guards, those nearing retirement and unwilling or unable to walk patrols. Their eyes are sharp, and they are prone to gossip. A pull from a flask of whiskey or a few silver pieces can persuade them to provide information on recent visitors.": "门口的守卫由年长的守卫组成，他们接近退休，不愿意或不能走动巡逻。他们的眼睛很敏锐，而且很容易说闲话。用一壶威士忌或几个银币就能说服他们提供关于最近访客的信息。",
	"Built on a low hill, the Saltmarsh barracks are also its jail. It is one of the few structures in Saltmarsh with an underground level. The jailer, Kraddok Stonehorn (LG male human {@creature gladiator}), is an old comrade of Eliander. He is a stickler for the rules, and Eliander trusts him with his life.": "萨尔马什军营建在一座低矮的山上，也是其监狱。它是萨尔马什为数不多的有地下一层的建筑之一。狱卒克拉多克-石角（LG男性人类（%0%））是伊莱恩德的一个老战友。他是个遵守规则的人，埃利安德把自己的生命托付给他。",
	"The jail in the cellar consists of two sections. A single large chamber holds drunks, brawling fishers, and other troublemakers who need to cool off for a few nights. The lock is high quality (requiring a successful DC 20 Dexterity check with thieves' tools to pick), and the door is built of stout wood with a small window to allow guards to check in on their charges.": "地窖里的监狱由两部分组成。一个大房间关押着醉汉、争吵的渔民和其他需要冷静几晚的麻烦制造者。锁的质量很高（需要用盗贼的工具成功地进行DC20的灵巧检查才能撬开），门是用坚固的木头建造的，有一个小窗，可以让守卫检查他们的指控。",
	"A side passage holds six individual cells with higher-quality locks (each requiring a successful DC 25 Dexterity check with thieves' tools to pick) and solid doors that lack windows.

The jump is usually not fatal; the water below the Leap is free of rocks, and it is a short swim back to dry land.": "传统上，当有亲人在海上溺水时，萨尔马什的人们会从悬崖上跳到下面的水中。这一跳通常并不致命；跃下的水面上没有岩石，而且只要游回干地就可以了。",
	"Services at this long-standing sea god's temple are well attended. The congregation is led by a one-legged former whaler: Wellgar Brinehanded (CG male human {@creature priest}), an older human man with a sharp memory for every storm, lost ship, and enormous catch ever brought into Saltmarsh harbor. He knows many fanciful stories of shipwrecks, lucky escapes, and famous captains. Matters ashore rarely interest him, but the temple and its bell tower are also served by a half-dozen novitiates and laypeople who keep things running smoothly.": "在这个历史悠久的海神庙里，参加仪式的人很多。会众由一位独腿的前捕鲸者领导。韦尔加-布林德（CG男性人类{@creature priest}），一个年长的人类男子，对每一次风暴、失落的船只和曾经进入萨尔马什港口的巨大渔获都有着敏锐的记忆。他知道许多关于沉船、幸运逃脱和著名船长的奇特故事。他对岸上的事情很少感兴趣，但寺庙和它的钟楼也有半打的见习生和普通人，他们维持着事情的顺利进行。",

	"Procan's domain is the sea, and whatever the oceans touch, he bears witness to. His mood shifts to darkness as he witnesses a brutal murder on the docks of a squalid port, then lifts in pride as he watches a brave mariner leap into the sea and save a drowning child. Every story of the oceans courses through his mind, and he in each moment curses and blesses mortals for their endless follies, heroism, and hatreds.": "普罗坎的领域是海洋，无论海洋接触到什么，他都会见证。当他目睹一个肮脏港口的码头上发生的残酷谋杀案时，他的心情转为黑暗；当他看到一个勇敢的水手跃入海中，救起一个溺水的孩子时，他又升起了自豪感。海洋的每一个故事都在他的脑海中闪过，他在每一个时刻都在诅咒和祝福凡人的无尽的愚蠢、英雄主义和仇恨。",
	"When the sea reaches its limit at the shore, so too does Procan's power. His clerics and priests rarely venture inland, and he cares little for what happens beyond his waters. At sea, he expects sacrifices in the form of fine food, potent alcohol, or valuable treasures thrown overboard at the start of a voyage. Due to this ritual, Procan holds all treasures lost at sea as part of his domain. He curses those who plunder shipwrecks without the blessings of his clerics, dogging their steps with wretched weather until his attention is drawn elsewhere.": "当大海在岸边达到极限时，普罗坎的力量也达到了极限。他的神职人员和祭司很少到内陆去冒险，他也很少关心在他的水域之外发生的事情。在海上，他希望祭品的形式是精美的食物、烈性的酒，或者在航行开始时被扔到海里的贵重财物。由于这种仪式，普罗坎把所有在海上丢失的财宝都视为他的领域的一部分。他诅咒那些在没有他的神职人员的祝福下掠夺沉船的人，用恶劣的天气拖住他们的脚步，直到他的注意力被吸引到其他地方。",
	"Procan's clerics reflect their deity's chaotic nature. They seek omens of his moods in the weather and sky, and mirror their own demeanor to match their deity's.": "普罗坎的神职人员反映了他们神灵的混乱本性。他们从天气和天空中寻找他的情绪预兆，并以自己的行为举止来配合他们的神灵。",

Those hardy souls who have infrequently sought entry (pursuing rumors of a secret hoard of alchemical gold) all returned with naught save grim tales of decaying chambers presided over by monstrous perils.

It was a revelation at the time, marking the first appearance in a D&D adventure of a haunted house and a raid on a sailing ship. It also set the tone for TSR UK's subsequent output, which often featured strong, central narratives that challenged players to take a creative approach to problem solving. They usually included multiple, smaller locations to explore, lending a sense of variety to a single adventure.": "1981年由TSR的英国分部制作，{@i Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh}是由Dave J. Brown和Don Turnbull设计。它在当时是一个启示，标志着D&D冒险中首次出现了鬼屋和对帆船的袭击。它也为TSR英国的后续作品定下了基调，这些作品通常以强有力的中心叙事为特色，挑战玩家采取创造性的方法来解决问题。它们通常包括多个较小的探索地点，给单一的冒险带来多样性的感觉。",
	"In recent times, there have been reports of fearsome hauntings, horrible shrieks, and eerie lights emanating from the dismal place. Now, not even the bravest of the area's denizens dare to approach the house, let alone enter it. If the characters seek anyone in Saltmarsh who has been in the place, they initially find no one.

	"If the characters pursue their questioning, they might (at your discretion) find an aged poacher who, after suitable inducement (money, ale, or both), confesses to having wandered in the back door of the house a couple of years before, hoping to acquire some food. Encouraged by the prospect of free wine in the cellar, he started to descend the stairs, heard ghastly shrieks and piercing wails, and ran, frightened out of his wits. He knows where the back door is and also noticed a nearby well. He can vaguely describe the kitchen, the scullery, and the passage that leads to them from the back door, but he knows nothing else about the layout of the place.": "如果人物继续追问，他们可能（由你决定）找到一个年老的偷猎者，在适当的诱导下（钱、酒或两者），他承认几年前曾徘徊在房子的后门，希望获得一些食物。在地窖里有免费酒的鼓励下，他开始下楼，听到可怕的尖叫声和刺耳的哀号声，吓得魂飞魄散，跑了出去。他知道后门在哪里，还注意到附近有一口井。他能模糊地描述厨房、洗碗间以及从后门通向它们的通道，但他对这个地方的其他布局一无所知。",
	"Furthermore, his memory of what frightened him has become exaggerated over the months, so he is likely to tell the party that a horde of ghosts came up the stairs to the scullery, or maybe it was a vampire with a swarm of rats. He discovered soon after his escapade that the telling of his tale, in ever more lurid detail, was an easy means of obtaining free ale foisted on him by appreciative listeners. Recently, however, none have asked him to tell the tale, so once his tongue is loosened, he is eager to restore some of his lost prestige. Apart from alerting adventurers to sinister and grave dangers of his own invention and telling them a little about the layout of the house, he provides no accurate or useful information.": "此外，几个月来，他对吓唬他的事情的记忆已经变得夸张了，所以他很可能会告诉大家，有一群鬼魂从楼梯上到了洗碗间，或者也许是一个吸血鬼带着一群老鼠来了。他在逃亡之后不久就发现，用越来越多的细节讲述他的故事，是获得欣赏他的听众强加给他的免费啤酒的一个简单手段。然而，最近没有人要求他讲述这个故事，所以一旦他的舌头松动，他就急于恢复他失去的一些威信。除了提醒冒险者注意他自己发明的险恶和严重的危险，以及告诉他们一些关于房子的布局，他没有提供准确或有用的信息。",
	"The secret of the haunted house is that it is not, in fact, haunted. It is the shore base for a band of smugglers led by a wizard named {@creature Sanbalet|GoS}. The eerie lights seen at night by onlookers are the smugglers' signals to a ship out at sea. The unearthly shrieks and other sounds are caused by {@spell magic mouth} spells strategically placed in the building. The smugglers, during their three years of successful operation, have through these tactics frightened away all local attempts at investigating their hideout.": "这座鬼屋的秘密在于，它其实并没有闹鬼。它是一伙走私者的岸上基地，由一个名叫（%%）的巫师领导。旁观者在夜间看到的阴森恐怖的灯光是走私者向海上的船只发出的信号。不合常理的尖叫声和其他声音是由放置在建筑物中的(1%)法术引起的。走私者在成功运作的三年里，通过这些策略吓跑了所有试图调查他们藏身之处的当地人。",

	"The characters discover a document that explains the signaling system used by the smugglers to indicate the ship has arrived; by deciphering and sending the proper return signal, they can put the crew at ease. By force or deception, the party boards the {@i Sea Ghost} and attempts to seize control. During this raid, the party encounters a captured sea elf named {@creature Oceanus|GoS} and a trio of lizardfolk warriors. The adventure concludes with signs that the lizardfolk are preparing for a raid, presumably on the town of Saltmarsh—though the truth, as outlined in the \"{@area Portents of War|0bb|x}\" section, is far more ominous.": "角色们发现了一份文件，其中解释了走私者用来表示船已抵达的信号系统；通过破译和发送正确的返回信号，他们可以让船员们放心。通过武力或欺骗，他们登上了{@i Sea Ghost}号，并试图夺取控制权。在这次突袭中，他们遇到了一个名叫（%%）的被俘海精灵和一群蜥蜴人战士。冒险结束时，有迹象表明蜥蜴人正在准备突袭，可能是对萨尔马什镇的突袭--尽管如\"{@area Portents of War|0bb|x} \"部分所述，事实远比这更不祥。",

	"Even to the pioneering folk of Q'barra, Saltmarsh is a frontier town. The lean-tos and shanties sprawl in the steaming eastern deltas of the Basura Swamp, and their inhabitants do their best to keep out of the affairs of the lizardfolk in the interior. An elf illusionist bearing the Mark of House Phiarlan leads the smugglers and seems bent on stirring up trouble.": "即使对Q'barra的开拓者来说，萨尔马什也是一个边陲小镇。在巴苏拉沼泽的东部三角洲，瘦小的帐篷和简陋的住所鳞次栉比，他们的居民尽力不参与内陆蜥蜴人的事务。一个带有皮亚伦家族印记的精灵幻术师领导着走私者，似乎一心想要挑起麻烦。",
	"Midway between Waterdeep and Neverwinter, the town of Saltmarsh and its hardy inhabitants endure both winter storms and the Mere of Dead Men to the south. Because of the politics churning in Thornhold on the far side of the marsh, help is often slow to come, and so the townsfolk have become quite self-reliant. The smugglers could be from Luskan, and their selling weapons to lizardfolk could be connected to deeper goals than simply lining their pockets.": "在Waterdeep和Neverwinter之间，Saltmarsh镇和它坚韧的居民要忍受冬季的风暴和南方的死人谷。由于沼泽远处的索恩霍尔德政治混乱，帮助往往姗姗来迟，因此镇民们已经变得相当自力更生。走私者可能来自卢斯坎，他们向蜥蜴人出售武器可能与更深层次的目标有关，而不仅仅是为了满足他们的口袋。",
	"Saltmarsh stands on the border between the Grand Duchy of Karameikos and the Five Shires, just inside the edge of the Blight Marsh.

	"A merchant in Saltmarsh who profits from the illegal activities of {@creature Sanbalet|GoS} has taken desperate action to ensure that the smuggling operation continues.

	"The alchemist lived a hermit's life, with few visitors and fewer friends. But a young messenger once emerged from the house with a story of a grand library containing countless tomes. Retellings of the messenger's tale have varied over the years, with the most popular versions suggesting that the alchemist had discovered a method of transforming base metals into gold.": "炼金术士过着隐士的生活，很少有访客，朋友也少。但有一次，一位年轻的信使从房子里走出来，说他有一个巨大的图书馆，里面有数不清的书本。多年来，关于这个使者的故事有不同的说法，最流行的版本是炼金术士发现了一种将贱金属转化为黄金的方法。",
	"It cannot stand! An unholy place so close to civilization. These accounts of wailing and flashing lights disturb the mind and heart.

A stiff wind blows in off the waves, carrying the briny stink of churning salt water.": "通往房子的道路蜿蜒穿过沿海的岩石地形，经常可以看到下面的大海。低沉的云层压在你身上；偶尔会有几片阳光出现在水面上。猛烈的风从海浪中吹来，带着盐水搅动的卤味气味。",
	"The house is located four miles up the coast from Saltmarsh and is accessible by an old road. Curious townsfolk might follow the party for part of their journey. These escorts engage the characters in conversation, ask about their intentions, and repeat the same rumors and stories heard in town.

Now, a few broken gardening tools and a tangle of weeds are all that remain. A single rosebush near the gate has overgrown the wall and choked out most of the other plants.

	"The glint inside the fireplace comes from a small crystal bauble (5 sp) that once belonged to the alchemist. The flat-bottomed crystal orb is pleasant to look at and tactilely satisfying to hold, but ultimately neither particularly valuable nor useful.

A character who carefully examines the window area and makes a successful DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check discovers small clues to this fact: fresh scratches on the sill where the signaling lantern has been placed, scuffing of the floor dust immediately near the window, and so forth. These signs cannot be seen from the door; they require up-close observation to be discovered.": "房子的位置和悬崖的地形相结合，使得这个房间从房子的任何地方都能看到最好的海景，走私者就是在这里向他们在海上的同事发出信号。仔细检查窗户区域并成功通过DC12智力({@skill Investigation})检查的人物会发现一些小线索：放置信号灯的窗台上有新的划痕，紧挨着窗户的地板灰尘有擦痕，等等。这些迹象在门外是看不到的；它们需要近距离观察才能发现。",

	"Neither Ned nor his merchant mentor are fools, and they have given some thought to preparing this story—it is not possible for the characters to discern Ned's true motives.

	"A few days after their triumphant return from the destruction of the smugglers' ring at the haunted house, the characters are hastily summoned to an emergency meeting of the Saltmarsh Town Council. Here it is explained to them that, though the land-based operation of the smuggling ring has been quashed, there must be a seagoing vessel by which the contraband was originally conveyed, and this is still at large. The council, fearful that any surviving smugglers could seek to reestablish their operation from some other base, asks the characters to apprehend this vessel and put an end, once and for all, to the smuggling.": "在他们从鬼屋摧毁走私团伙胜利归来的几天后，这些人物被匆匆召集到萨尔马什镇议会的紧急会议上。在这里，人们向他们解释说，尽管走私团伙在陆地上的活动已经被粉碎，但一定有一艘最初运送违禁品的海船，而且它仍然在逃。议会担心任何幸存的走私者可能会从其他基地重新建立他们的行动，要求人物逮捕这艘船，一劳永逸地结束走私活动。",
	"A reward of 400 gp is offered to the characters for the successful conclusion of the mission.": "成功完成任务的人物可获得400金币的奖励。",
	"The council reasons that the smugglers on the vessel are, as yet, unaware of the capture or death of their land-based colleagues, and a return visit by them might well be expected. Since the last consignment was offloaded only a short while ago, another one is not expected for some time—perhaps during the next new moon, which begins in about two weeks' time.": "议会的理由是，船上的走私者还不知道他们在陆地上的同事被抓或死了，而且他们很可能会再次来访。由于最后一批货物是在不久前才卸下的，预计在一段时间内不会有另一批货物，也许是在大约两周后开始的下一个新月。",
	"The council arranges for members of the town guard to patrol the potential rendezvous points each night for the next two weeks in case the smugglers return earlier than expected. If the ship is sighted, the council is unwilling to risk the lives of volunteers by ordering them to take the ship and its crew by force. As soon as an approaching vessel is spotted, the council expects the characters to perform the actual task of boarding.": "议会安排镇上的卫队成员在接下来的两个星期里每晚在可能的集合点上巡逻，以防走私者比预期的更早返回。如果发现船只，议会不愿意让志愿者冒生命危险，命令他们用武力夺取船只和船员。一旦发现接近的船只，议会希望人物能够执行实际的登船任务。",
	"Once the characters accept the undertaking, the council puts a small fishing boat at their disposal and provides them with any reasonable amount of nonmagical equipment that they feel they require. The boat is large enough to accommodate the entire party plus two. The council also provides the services of two members of the guard to sail the boat for them when needed. They are not willing to board the {@i Sea Ghost} with the characters, though they defend themselves and the fishing boat if it is attacked.": "一旦人物接受了这项承诺，委员会就会将一艘小渔船交给他们使用，并为他们提供他们认为需要的任何合理数量的非魔法装备。这艘船足够大，可以容纳整个队伍加两个人。委员会还提供两名卫队成员的服务，在需要时为他们开船。他们不愿意和人物一起登上{@i Sea Ghost}，但如果渔船受到攻击，他们会保护自己和渔船。",
	"If the characters discovered the bullseye lantern and the parchment in {@area area 22|113|x} of the haunted house, they have a big clue to how the smugglers communicate. You might require the characters to make a successful DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to determine how the system works—although certain facts are not written on the parchment. Alternatively, you can allow the characters to experiment with sending signals when the ship comes back.": "如果人物在鬼屋的（%0%）里发现了牛眼灯和羊皮纸，他们就有了走私者如何交流的重要线索。你可以要求人物成功地进行DC12智力（（%1%））检查，以确定这个系统是如何工作的--尽管羊皮纸上没有写某些事实。另外，你可以让角色们在船回来后试验一下发送信号。",
	"The signaling system utilizes the bullseye lantern to communicate the following messages by combining long and short flashes:": "该信号系统利用牛眼灯，通过长、短闪相结合的方式传达以下信息。",

	"{@b Long–long–long}: \"Ready to unload; come to the ship.\" (The ship confirms a reply with this signal.)": "{@b Long–long–long}: \"准备卸货；到船上来。\" (船方以这个信号确认回复)。",
	"The arrangement calls for someone aboard the ship to flash the first signal. The shore party replies by flashing the second signal, after which the third signal flashes from the ship. It drops anchor and waits for the arrival of a boat from shore. A small group of smugglers approaches the ship in a rowboat. When it arrives, the ship sends a boat in the other direction. These two vessels alternate in transferring contraband between the ship and the shore, with one of them remaining in the shore cave at the end of the operation.": "该安排要求船上的人闪烁第一个信号。岸上的人以闪动第二个信号作为回应，然后从船上闪动第三个信号。船只抛下锚，等待岸上的船只到来。一小群走私者乘坐划艇接近该船。当它到达时，该船向另一个方向派出了一艘船。这两艘船交替在船上和岸上转移违禁品，其中一艘在行动结束后留在岸上的洞穴里。",
	"It has been arranged (though this does not appear on the parchment) for the first signal to be repeated every 10 minutes for an hour. If the ship gets no response, it is assumed that there is some delay and the {@i Sea Ghost} sails away, returning the next night.": "已经安排好了（虽然羊皮纸上没有显示），每10分钟重复一次第一个信号，持续一个小时。如果船没有得到回应，就认为有一些延迟，{@i Sea Ghost}就会驶离，第二天晚上返回。",
	"The smugglers will drop anchor if the characters send any kind of return signal to the ship—not necessarily the correct one. The crew of the {@i Sea Ghost} is accustomed to seeing an improper signal from time to time, because the gang on the shore often operates the lantern clumsily. Just in case something has gone awry, however, the ship's crew will be on alert when the characters make their approach.": "如果这些人物向船上发出任何形式的返回信号--不一定是正确的信号，走私者就会抛锚。{@i Sea Ghost}号的船员已经习惯于时常看到不正确的信号，因为岸上的那帮人经常笨拙地操作灯笼。然而，为了防止出现问题，当这些人物靠近时，船上的船员会保持警惕。",
	"How long it takes the characters to reach the ship depends on what arrangements they have made beforehand. If, for example, it is arranged that the guard members, once they have seen the ship, row ashore and pick the characters up (say in the cave below the haunted house), that takes 15 or 20 minutes. The characters then board the fishing boat, which is rowed out toward the ship. The journey to the ship takes 30 minutes (20 minutes with more than two rowing), but if the boat is to approach the {@i Sea Ghost} from the seaward side, another 5 minutes should be added. The ship is lying broadside to the coastline, the starboard side facing landward. If the characters approach it from this side, they are automatically seen when within 20 feet, even if they approach silently and without light.": "人物需要多长时间才能到达船上，这取决于他们事先做了什么安排。例如，如果安排警卫人员在看到船后，划船上岸并接上人物（比如在鬼屋下面的山洞里），这需要15或20分钟。然后人物登上渔船，向船的方向划去。到船上的旅程需要30分钟（两个以上的人划船需要20分钟），但如果船要从向海一侧接近（%0%），则应再加5分钟。该船宽躺在海岸线上，右舷朝向陆地。如果人物从这一侧接近它，他们在20英尺范围内就会被自动看到，即使他们无声无息地接近，没有灯光。",
	"If the characters approach silently from the port side, without using light sources, they will be totally unobserved—the smugglers on deck are watching the coast from the starboard side and do not see or hear intruders who don't give themselves away. Thus, whether the alarm is raised or not depends on a number of factors: from which direction the boat approaches the ship, whether the watchers on the ship are alerted to possible danger (a previous incorrect response to the signal), and whether the characters have taken all precautions to conceal their approach.": "如果人物从左舷悄悄接近，不使用光源，他们将完全不被观察到--甲板上的走私者从右舷观察海岸，看不到或听不到不暴露自己的入侵者。因此，警报是否发出取决于许多因素：船从哪个方向接近船只，船上的观察者是否对可能的危险有所警觉（之前对信号的错误反应），以及人物是否采取了一切预防措施来隐藏他们的接近。",
	"Between the extremes outlined above (automatic detection of a direct approach or no detection of a silent and dark approach from the seaward side), you must judge the circumstances, decide on the probability of detection, and determine the outcome.": "在上述两种极端情况（自动探测到直接接近或没有探测到从向海一侧无声无息的黑暗接近）之间，你必须判断情况，决定探测的概率，并确定结果。",
	"Though it is possible for the characters to capture the {@i Sea Ghost}, they also might choose to destroy it.": "虽然人物有可能捕捉到{@i Sea Ghost}，但他们也可能选择摧毁它。",
	"The {@i Sea Ghost} is mainly of wooden construction, so fire always presents a hazard. The ship could, with some difficulty, be set ablaze and burned down to the waterline. The vessel will not ignite readily, for its hull, rigging, spars, and sails are all damp with sea water.": "{@i Sea Ghost}主要是木质结构，所以火灾总是带来危险。这艘船可以在一定程度上被点燃，烧到水线。该船不会轻易被点燃，因为它的船体、索具、桅杆和船帆都被海水浸湿了。",
	"Deliberate attempts to set the ship ablaze can be undertaken only while aboard it. This involves the use of at least two flasks of oil applied to 2 cubic feet of dry, combustible material such as sacking, cloth, wool, or wood kindling, which is then set aflame. Bolts of silk soaked in brandy make excellent combustibles and do not require oil to be ignited. Use your discretion if the ship catches fire, but assume it burns to the waterline within 20 minutes.": "故意放火烧船的尝试只能在船上进行。这包括使用至少两瓶油涂抹在2立方英尺的干燥可燃材料上，如麻袋、布、羊毛或木柴，然后点燃。浸泡在白兰地中的丝线是很好的可燃物，不需要用油来点燃。如果船着火了，请酌情处理，但要假定它在20分钟内烧到水线。",
	"Attempts to hole the ship and sink it require the use of axes or similar implements applied with vigor. This undertaking takes 5 minutes, but the noise alerts the smugglers. Two of them are sent to investigate and raise the alarm. The rest of the crew rapidly converge on the area and attack any intruders. If the hole is completed, the ship takes on water and sinks after an hour if the hole remains unrepaired.": "试图在船上打洞并使其沉没，需要使用斧头或类似的工具，并大力使用。这项工作需要5分钟，但噪音惊动了走私者。他们中的两个人被派去调查并发出警报。其余的船员迅速向该地区集结，攻击任何入侵者。如果洞口完成，船就会进水，一小时后如果洞口仍未修复就会沉没。",
	"This area is not shown on the map but is—predictably—atop the mast, 40 feet above the main deck. Access to it is provided by a rope ladder whose lower end drops near the hatch on the main deck. The crow's nest is an open, wooden platform, 10 feet square with 3-foot-high wooden walls. Opening a 2-foot-square hatch in the floor lets out the rope ladder that descends to the main deck.": "这个区域在地图上没有显示，但可以预见的是，它位于桅杆顶部，比主甲板高出40英尺。通过一个绳梯可以进入，绳梯的下端落在主甲板的舱口附近。鸦巢是一个开放的木制平台，10英尺见方，有3英尺高的木墙。打开地板上的一个2英尺见方的舱门，就可以看到下降到主甲板上的绳梯。",
	"A single crew member ({@creature bandit}) occupies this area when the party approaches the ship. The crew member looks toward the house and awaits a signal. There is no chance that he detects the characters' approach to the ship or their boarding of the ship if the others on board below fail to do so—his gaze is fixed at a higher level.": "当队伍接近船只时，一名船员（{@creature bandit}）占据了这个区域。该船员看向房子，等待信号。如果下面的其他船员没有察觉到，他就没有机会察觉到人物的接近或他们的登船--他的目光被固定在更高的地方。",
	"If those on the deck below detect the characters' intrusion, the crew member's attention is attracted (even if his colleagues forget to alert him), and he descends with all speed to the deck to assist his mates. Otherwise, he is oblivious to the characters' intrusion unless someone climbs the rope ladder or the rigging to approach his position; he always detects such an approach when the climber is 15 feet below him, investigating and attacking if circumstances warrant it.": "如果下面甲板上的人发现了人物的入侵，船员的注意力就会被吸引（即使他的同事忘记提醒他），他就会全速下降到甲板上，协助他的同伴。否则，他对人物的入侵视而不见，除非有人爬上绳梯或索具接近他的位置；他总是在攀爬者低于他15英尺时发现这种接近，如果情况需要，他就会进行调查和攻击。",
	"If the characters make a direct approach, they can try to bluff their way aboard once they have been detected. For instance, they might say they are new recruits to the smuggling gang, unaccustomed to the codes and thus made a mistake with the signaling, or something of a similar nature.": "如果人物直接上船，一旦被发现，他们可以尝试虚张声势地上船。例如，他们可以说自己是走私团伙的新成员，不习惯使用密码，因此犯了一个信号错误，或类似性质的东西。",
	"If the story is reasonably convincing, allow the characters to make a DC 14 Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check. If the check is successful, they are believed up to the point when the first three characters get aboard by means of a rope ladder lowered for them. Once the characters' approach is detected, the entire crew attempts to repel the characters with the utmost vigor while getting their vessel under way.": "如果故事相当有说服力，允许角色进行DC14魅力（{@skill Deception}）检查。如果检查成功，他们就会被相信，直到前三个角色通过为他们放下的绳梯上船。一旦人物的接近被发现，全体船员就会试图用最大的力量击退这些人物，同时让他们的船开动。",
	"Climbing aboard the {@i Sea Ghost} undetected is no small feat. Keep in mind the following as the characters attempt to board:": "在不被发现的情况下爬上{@i Sea Ghost}号是一个不小的成就。当人物试图登船时，请牢记以下几点。",
	"{@skill Perception} checks that rely on hearing are made with disadvantage on the ship because of the sound of the waves and sea.": "{@skill Perception}依赖听觉的检查在船上是不利的，因为有海浪和大海的声音。",
	"The hull of the ship provides many handholds for climbing but is also very slippery. Climbing the hull without a rope or other device requires a successful DC 14 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check. On a failed check, the climber falls into the water.": "船体提供了许多攀爬的抓手，但也非常滑溜。在没有绳索或其他装置的情况下攀登船体，需要成功地进行DC14力量（{@skill Athletics}）检查。如果检查失败，攀爬者会掉入水中。",
	"Aside from Captain Sigurd \"Snake Eyes\" ({@creature pirate captain|GoS}; see {@adventure appendix C|GoS|10}), the crew of the {@i Sea Ghost} consists of the following members:": "除了船长Sigurd \"Snake Eyes\"（{@creature pirate captain|GoS}；见{@adventure appendix C|GoS|10}），{@i Sea Ghost}号的船员包括以下成员。",

	"If the ship's captain, the first mate, the bosun, and the deck wizard are all killed or have fled, and if the characters then outnumber the surviving crew and lizardfolk combined, the smugglers offer to surrender the ship to the characters. They seek the most advantageous terms they can get, but their minimum requirements will be their lives and liberty, and the ship's jolly boat in which to flee. If the characters refuse these terms, the smugglers offer to trade information in exchange for treasure. Their minimum requirement, in this case, is 100 gp to disclose the whereabouts of the secret cache of weapons and the fact they were to deliver these arms to the lizardfolk. They do not know the exact location of the rendezvous point, only that it is about ten miles or so along the coast west of the haunted house, near the mouth of a small river. For a further amount of 50 gp, they reveal the presence of the sea elf prisoner in {@area area 14|16b|x}.": "如果船长、大副、水手和甲板上的巫师都被杀死或逃走了，而且如果这些人物的人数超过了幸存的船员和蜥蜴人的总和，那么走私者就会向这些人物提出投降。他们希望得到最有利的条件，但他们的最低要求是他们的生命和自由，以及乘坐船上的欢乐船逃离。如果人物拒绝这些条件，走私者就会提出用信息来换取财宝。在这种情况下，他们的最低要求是100金币，以透露秘密武器库的下落以及他们将把这些武器交给蜥蜴人的事实。他们不知道集合点的确切位置，只知道它在鬼屋以西的海岸线上约10英里处，靠近一条小河的河口。只要再付50金币，他们就会透露海精灵囚犯的存在（%0%）。",
	"The name of the vessel, {@i Sea Ghost}, is painted on both sides of the prow.

	"Of course, the characters do not know the truth behind the lizardfolk's need to purchase weapons. To learn the truth, more of the story must unfold. See chapter 3, {@adventure Danger at Dunwater|GoS|2}.": "当然，这些人物并不知道蜥蜴人需要购买武器背后的真相。要了解真相，必须展开更多的故事。见第三章，（%0%）。",
	"The smugglers are very successful. Their main source of income is the sale of stolen goods, especially those marked with a royal seal or similar identifier that would make dealing with legitimate merchants impossible. They also take in goods from ships they have waylaid, usually spices, weapons, poisons, and other contraband that is either illegal or heavily taxed in this region. Currently, the ship's hold is crowded with mining equipment and kegs of brandy stolen from a royal shipment meant for a crown-sponsored mining operation in this region, along with silks that were originally destined for a royal trade mission.": "走私者是非常成功的。他们的主要收入来源是销售赃物，特别是那些标有皇家印章或类似标识的货物，这样就不可能与合法商人打交道。他们也从他们劫持的船只上接收货物，通常是香料、武器、毒药和其他违禁品，这些货物在这个地区要么是非法的，要么是被征收重税的。目前，这艘船的船舱里挤满了采矿设备和从皇家运输中偷来的白兰地桶，这些白兰地是为皇家在这个地区赞助的采矿行动准备的，还有原本是为皇家贸易代表团准备的丝绸。",
	"If the characters break the smuggling ring, they are free to keep whatever other treasure they find without consequence, but the current contents of the hold must be handled carefully.": "如果人物打破了走私团伙，他们可以自由地保留他们找到的任何其他宝藏而不产生任何后果，但必须小心处理船舱中的现有物品。",
	"Representatives of the crown in Saltmarsh will pay 200 gp for the return of the silk and brandy stored under the house (in {@area area 27|128|x}) and 500 gp for the merchandise aboard the {@i Sea Ghost} (the goods in {@area area 11|15f|x} and the weapons in {@area area 15|170|x}).": "萨尔马什的王室代表将为归还存放在房子下面的丝绸和白兰地（在（%0%））支付200克普，为（%1%）船上的商品（（%2%）的货物和（%3%）的武器）支付500克普。",
	"Royal agents might also claim the smugglers' ship, but at your option, if the characters have proven eager to aid the crown, they are given the ship and pledged the service of a contingent of sailors to man it for one year.": "皇家特工也可能要求得到走私者的船，但根据你的选择，如果这些人物被证明渴望帮助王室，他们就会得到这艘船，并保证有一支水手队伍在一年内为其服务。",
	"If the characters keep the merchandise and try to sell it openly in the region, they find no buyers. Such an attempt earns them a poor reputation, the effect of which is up to you.": "如果这些人物保留商品并试图在该地区公开出售，他们会发现没有买家。这样的尝试会给他们带来不好的名声，其效果由你决定。",
	"The discovery that a colony of lizardfolk lies near the small fishing town of Saltmarsh and is purchasing weaponry considered sophisticated by lizardfolk standards has alarmed the Saltmarsh Town Council. Greatly troubled and filled with apprehension, the councillors call an emergency meeting.": "发现一个蜥蜴人的殖民地位于小渔镇Saltmarsh附近，并且正在购买以蜥蜴人的标准认为是先进的武器，这让Saltmarsh镇议会感到震惊。忧心忡忡的议员们召开了一次紧急会议。",
	"This adventure is designed for a group of four to six 3rd-level characters.": "这场冒险是为四到六个三级角色的小组设计的。",
	"Dave J. Brown and Don Turnbull continued the Saltmarsh series in this classic. Doubling down on TSR UK's penchant for exploration and interaction in their work, this scenario challenges the characters to act as ambassadors to a colony of lizardfolk.": "戴夫-J-布朗和唐-特恩布尔在这部经典作品中延续了《萨尔马什》系列。在TSR英国公司的作品中，他们对探索和互动的偏好得到了加倍的发挥，这个场景挑战人物作为大使前往蜥蜴人的殖民地。",
	"While such roleplay-focused adventures are the norm today, at the time of its publication (in 1982) this adventure was the first to make interaction an absolute requirement for success, rather than one option among many.": "虽然这种以角色扮演为重点的冒险在今天已经成为常态，但在其出版时（1982年），这个冒险是第一个将互动作为成功的绝对要求，而不是众多选项中的一个。",
	"The characters are not required to have finished {@adventure The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh|GoS|1} before playing {@i Danger at Dunwater}. If they arrive in Saltmarsh after the events of the prior adventure, they learn the following information from the townsfolk:": "角色在玩{@i Danger at Dunwater}之前不需要完成{@adventure The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh|GoS|1}。如果他们在之前的冒险事件之后到达萨尔马什，他们会从镇民那里得知以下信息。",
	"A smuggling ring operating out of an abandoned house has been disbanded.": "一个在废弃房屋内运作的走私团伙已被解散。",
	"The smugglers were slain or jailed.": "走私者被杀或入狱。",
	"The smugglers were supplying weapons to a tribe of lizardfolk that have established a colony near Saltmarsh.": "走私者向一个在萨尔马什附近建立了殖民地的蜥蜴人部落提供武器。",
	"When the councillors discover that a seasoned group of adventurers has arrived in town, they send a message to the characters inviting them to a meeting. The council hopes to hire them to investigate the lizardfolk lair and learn why the creatures are arming themselves. The council's main priority in the context of this adventure is to keep the town safe from a possible lizardfolk attack.": "当议员们发现一群经验丰富的冒险家来到镇上时，他们给这些人物发了一条信息，邀请他们参加一个会议。议会希望雇佣他们来调查蜥蜴人的巢穴，并了解这些生物为什么要武装自己。在这次冒险中，委员会的主要任务是保护小镇的安全，使其免受蜥蜴人的攻击。",
	"Judging from a crude map found aboard the smugglers' vessel and from information provided by the sea elf {@creature Oceanus|GoS}, it seems likely that the lizardfolk are preparing for war. The council members hope that the townspeople are not the intended target, but they greatly fear this possibility.": "从走私者船上发现的一张粗糙的地图和海精灵（%0%）提供的信息来看，蜥蜴人似乎正在为战争做准备。议会成员希望镇民不是预定目标，但他们非常担心这种可能性。",
	"The site of the lizardfolk colony has been tentatively identified as a coastal promontory adjacent to a small river, the Dunwater, some ten miles southwest of Saltmarsh. The council considers it essential that a scouting party be sent to reconnoiter the area and ascertain the strength and size of this colony, as well as the intentions of the lizardfolk. The characters (whether or not they are veterans of the previous adventure) are approached to undertake this mission.": "蜥蜴人聚居地的地点已被初步确定为一个海岸岬角，毗邻一条小河，即邓沃特河，位于萨尔马什西南约10英里处。议会认为有必要派遣一支侦察队来侦察该地区，并确定该殖民地的实力和规模，以及蜥蜴人的意图。角色们（无论他们是否是前一次冒险的老手）被邀请承担这项任务。",
	"The leader of the council impresses upon the characters that they are not required to act with hostile intent—in fact, quite the opposite. Their assignment is one of information gathering, with the additional hope that they can return with knowledge of what the lizardfolk are up to. A reward of 700 gp is offered for the successful completion of the mission.": "委员会的领导向这些人物强调，他们不需要带着敌意行事--事实上，恰恰相反。他们的任务是收集信息，并希望他们能带着关于蜥蜴人的知识回来。成功完成任务的人将获得700戈比的奖励。",
	"The people of Saltmarsh, and of course the characters, are unaware of the true situation as the adventure gets under way. The lizardfolk are not preparing for war against Saltmarsh, but against a much more sinister presence: the sahuagin.": "萨尔马什的人们，当然还有人物，在冒险开始时并不知道真实情况。蜥蜴人不是在准备对萨尔马什的战争，而是在准备对付一个更邪恶的存在：萨瓦金。",
	"Just over a year ago, a colony of lizardfolk were driven from their home by an invasion of sahuagin. Forced to find a temporary home, they restored an old lizardfolk stronghold that had been abandoned for decades.": "就在一年多以前，一个蜥蜴人的聚居地被萨瓦金人的入侵赶出了他们的家园。他们被迫找到一个临时的家，恢复了一个被遗弃了几十年的古老蜥蜴人的据点。",
	"Determined to recapture their home, the lizardfolk have been busily purchasing arms and negotiating an alliance with other nearby aquatic races. The lizardfolk's main purpose is to form an army to expel the sahuagin from the area. In so doing, they hope to discourage the sahuagin from ever again intruding on the region.": "蜥蜴人决心夺回自己的家园，一直在忙着购买武器，并与附近的其他水生种族谈判结盟。蜥蜴人的主要目的是组建一支军队，将萨瓦金人驱逐出该地区。这样做，他们希望能阻止萨瓦金人再次侵入该地区。",
	"The lizardfolk have not approached Saltmarsh with an offer to join the alliance because {@creature Othokent|GoS}, their queen, considers humans and other land-dwelling races as of little use in a battle to be fought largely underwater.": "蜥蜴人没有向萨尔马什提出加入联盟的建议，因为他们的女王（%0%）认为人类和其他陆上居住的种族在一场主要在水下进行的战斗中没有什么用。",
	"Ambassadors from the koalinth, the locathah, and the merfolk are present in the lizardfolk lair. The sea elves were not invited to join the alliance because of long-standing disputes between them and the koalinth—even in the face of the sahuagin threat, no cooperation is possible between these two peoples. The lizardfolk, concluding that the koalinth are the stronger tribe, invited them to participate rather than the elves.": "来自考林斯、洛萨塔和人鱼族的大使都在蜥蜴人的巢穴中。海精灵没有被邀请加入联盟，因为他们和koalinth之间有长期的争端--即使面对sahuagin的威胁，这两个民族之间也不可能合作。蜥蜴人得出结论，考林斯是更强大的部落，因此邀请他们参加而不是精灵。",
	"Members of these four races have come together, overlooking their previous rivalries and differences, to negotiate an agreement of cooperation. But even as the lizardfolk strive to hold their alliance together in the face of a common foe, the bonds are beginning to fray.": "这四个种族的成员走到一起，忽略了他们以前的竞争和分歧，谈判达成了合作协议。但是，即使蜥蜴人在面对一个共同的敌人时努力维持他们的联盟，这种联系也开始出现裂痕。",
	"How the characters perform their mission, and what sort of relationship they establish with the lizardfolk on behalf of Saltmarsh, will determine if the coalition has any chance of success.": "人物如何执行任务，以及他们代表萨尔马什与蜥蜴人建立什么样的关系，将决定联盟是否有成功的机会。",
	"If the characters freed {@creature Oceanus|GoS} from his cell aboard the {@i Sea Ghost} in {@adventure The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh|GoS|1}, the elf offers to join them in their expedition to the lizardfolk lair. His skills in combat and knowledge of the seas and the dark things that dwell there might prove invaluable to the party. He recognizes and identifies the sahuagin remains in the lair. He takes an equal share of both treasure and experience points.": "如果人物在(2%)的(1%)号上把{@creature Oceanus|GoS}从他的牢房中释放出来，这个精灵就会主动加入他们对蜥蜴人巢穴的远征。他的战斗技巧以及对海洋和居住在那里的黑暗事物的了解，可能会证明对他们来说是无价的。他认出并确认了巢穴中的萨瓦金人遗体。他在财宝和经验值方面都占有同等份额。",
	"Alternatively, {@creature Oceanus|GoS} might have allied with the town council previously and offers to join the characters as they embark for the lizardfolk lair.": "另外，{@creature Oceanus|GoS}可能之前已经与镇议会结盟，并提出在他们前往蜥蜴人巢穴的时候加入角色。",
	"{@creature Oceanus|GoS} wants to discover the truth behind the lizardfolk's purchase of smuggled weapons and armor. Like the town council, he initially sees the lizardfolk as a potential threat.": "{@creature Oceanus|GoS}想要发现蜥蜴人购买走私武器和盔甲的真相。和镇议会一样，他最初也认为蜥蜴人是一个潜在的威胁。",
	"Two political groups operate in the social structure of the lizardfolk lair. On the one hand are the dominant progressives led by the queen, {@creature Othokent|GoS}, who is supported by a subchief named Irhtos, several officers, and many warriors. Her progressive stance is inspired and driven by wisdom of the aged lizardfolk minister, {@creature Sauriv|GoS}.": "在蜥蜴人巢穴的社会结构中，有两个政治团体在运作。一方面是由女王（%0%）领导的占主导地位的进步派，她得到了一个名叫伊尔托斯的副酋长、几个军官和许多战士的支持。她的进步立场受到年老的蜥蜴人部长（1%）的智慧的启发和推动。",
	"Opposing that group (mostly covertly, for the rule of the queen remains absolute) are the traditionalists, led by the shamans. The shamans believe that allying and intermingling with other races is contrary to the divine will of their god, Semuanya, and that no good can come of it. Consequently, the shamans hate and distrust the minister, {@creature Sauriv|GoS}, whom they consider to be the prime instigator of these efforts that go against nature. They dare not move openly against him, however, since he enjoys the trust and favor of the queen.": "反对这一群体的是以萨满为首的传统派（主要是隐蔽的，因为女王的统治仍然是绝对的）。巫师们认为，与其他种族结盟和交融是与他们的神Semuanya的神圣意志相违背的，而且不会有好结果。因此，巫师们憎恨和不信任部长（%0%），他们认为部长是这些违背自然的努力的主要煽动者。然而，他们不敢公开反对他，因为他得到了女王的信任和青睐。",
	"If the lizardfolk queen is killed in the course of this adventure, she is succeeded by the subchief. If the subchief is also killed, the succession goes to one of the warrior officers. If all of these are slain, then succession falls to the most senior surviving shaman. In this event, the shaman denounces the alliance, pulls the lizardfolk out of it, sacrifices the aged lizardfolk minister to the lizardfolk deity Semuanya, and leads the remainder of the tribe into the depths of the marsh beyond the reach of the sahuagin. If all the lizardfolk notables are slain, surviving members of the tribe simply drift away into the marsh, taking all their possessions with them. There will then be no chance of an alliance against the sahuagin that involves the lizardfolk.": "如果蜥蜴人女王在这次冒险过程中被杀，她将由副酋长继承。如果副首领也被杀了，那么继承权就会落在一个武士官身上。如果所有这些人都被杀了，那么继承权就落在幸存的最高级萨满身上。在这种情况下，萨满会谴责联盟，把蜥蜴人从联盟中拉出来，把年老的蜥蜴人部长献给蜥蜴人神Semuanya，并带领部落的其余成员进入萨瓦金人无法到达的沼泽深处。如果所有蜥蜴人的重要人物都被杀了，幸存的部落成员就会带着他们所有的财产漂流到沼泽里。这样一来，就没有机会与蜥蜴人结盟对抗萨瓦金人了。",
	"Ideally, when the characters learn the truth about the lizardfolk and the sahuagin, they have done so before causing irreparable harm to the occupants of the lair and the lizardfolk's plans for the alliance against the sahuagin. For their mission to have any chance of succeeding, the characters must eventually gain—or be forcibly prodded into—an audience with the queen. Even if her initial reaction is not a friendly one, the characters might still have a chance of winning over the lizardfolk and making them receptive (if the characters suggest as much) to admitting Saltmarsh into the alliance.": "理想的情况是，当人物了解到蜥蜴人和萨瓦金的真相时，他们在对巢穴的居住者和蜥蜴人对抗萨瓦金的联盟计划造成不可挽回的伤害之前就已经这样做了。为了使他们的任务有任何成功的机会，这些人物最终必须获得--或者被强行催促--与女王会面。即使她最初的反应并不友好，角色们仍然有机会赢得蜥蜴人的好感，让他们接受（如果角色们建议的话）接纳萨尔马什加入联盟。",
	"Handling the interaction between the two sides against the backdrop of the first contact between the lizardfolk and potentially friendly humans can be difficult. Though it's always possible to let roleplaying take its course, particularly if the characters refrain from combat and make a good first impression, things might not play out quite that simply. Here are some guidelines on how to handle this aspect of the adventure.": "在蜥蜴人和潜在的友好人类首次接触的背景下，处理双方的互动可能是困难的。尽管总是有可能让角色扮演顺其自然，特别是如果角色避免战斗并给人留下良好的第一印象，但事情可能不会那么简单。这里有一些关于如何处理这个方面的冒险的指南。",
	"The lizardfolk start out indifferent toward the characters and, by extension, Saltmarsh. To track the attitude of the lizardfolk, use points to record the characters' progress toward sealing an alliance. The characters begin the adventure with 0 points. That score is adjusted every time they interact with lizardfolk, but the results only become apparent when the characters meet the lizardfolk queen. They can then earn more points through diplomacy and by improving the tribe's strength and safety.": "蜥蜴人开始时对这些角色无动于衷，并延伸到萨尔马什。为了跟踪蜥蜴人的态度，可以用积分来记录人物在缔结联盟方面的进展。冒险开始时，人物的积分为0。每当他们与蜥蜴人互动时，这个分数就会被调整，但结果只有在人物遇到蜥蜴人女王时才会显现。然后，他们可以通过外交手段和提高部落的实力和安全来获得更多的分数。",
	"The alliance is sealed if the characters reach or exceed 50 points, at which point the lizardfolk become friendly to them. They are invited to see the queen a second time, and during this session the groundwork for Saltmarsh's inclusion in the alliance can be laid.": "如果角色达到或超过50分，联盟就会被封存，此时蜥蜴人会对他们友好。他们会被邀请去见女王第二次，在这个环节中，可以为萨尔马什加入联盟奠定基础。",
	"The lizardfolk become irrevocably hostile if the characters' total number of points drops to 0 or lower even after the queen offers them chances at diplomacy and ways to improve their standing. If this happens, after the lizardfolk give them a second chance, the characters' mission ends in failure.": "如果角色的积分总数下降到0或更低，甚至在女王为他们提供了外交机会和改善他们地位的方法之后，蜥蜴人也会变得不可逆转的敌对。如果发生这种情况，在蜥蜴人给他们第二次机会后，角色的任务就会以失败告终。",
	"The point system starts working when the adventure begins, but its ramifications aren't apparent until the PCs meet the queen for the first time. This most likely occurs after they engage a group of lizardfolk without fighting them, whereupon they are put in custody and taken to her. When this happens, determine the characters' current point total by using the Initial Attitude table, giving them benefits and penalties according to what they have done so far. The characters might have a negative score at this point if they were hostile toward the lizardfolk prior to their audience.": "积分系统在冒险开始时就开始工作了，但是它的影响在NPC第一次见到女王之前并不明显。这很可能发生在他们与一群蜥蜴人交战而没有战斗之后，在那里他们被关押并被带到女王面前。当这种情况发生时，通过使用初始态度表来确定人物当前的积分总数，根据他们到目前为止所做的事情给予他们好处和惩罚。如果人物在听众面前对蜥蜴人有敌意，那么他们在这一点上可能会有负分。",
	"{@creature Othokent|GoS} is worldly for a lizardfolk. In her youth, she spent several years exploring the nearby marshes. She found human society interesting and observed caravans and villages in secret. She knows about the outside world but feigns ignorance in an attempt to catch the characters in a lie. She respects those who show her respect and treat her people as their equals, rather than as primitive fools to be mocked or patronized. Her experience with humans tells her that they can be useful allies, but she also knows that they can be duplicitous.": "{@creature Othokent|GoS}对蜥蜴人来说是个世故的人。在她年轻的时候，她花了几年时间探索附近的沼泽地。她发现人类社会很有趣，并秘密地观察商队和村庄。她知道外面的世界，但她假装无知，试图在谎言中抓住人物。她尊重那些对她表示尊重的人，把她的族人当作平等的人，而不是把他们当作原始的傻瓜来嘲弄或袒护。她与人类打交道的经验告诉她，他们可以成为有用的盟友，但她也知道，他们可能是两面派。",
	"During this meeting, the queen makes it clear how she feels about the characters' behavior so far. She gives them a lot of credit for not killing any lizardfolk (if that's the case), or she chastises them for taking the lives of lizardfolk unnecessarily. If hatchlings are among the characters' victims, the queen is close to outrage and makes no secret of it. Conversely, if the characters arrive with hatchlings in tow, her estimation of them rises steeply.": "在这次会议上，女王清楚地表明了她对这些人物迄今为止的行为的看法。她为他们没有杀死任何蜥蜴人而大加赞赏（如果是这样的话），或者她责备他们不必要地夺走蜥蜴人的生命。如果人物的受害者中有幼崽，女王就会接近于愤怒，并且毫不掩饰。相反，如果人物带着幼崽来到这里，她对他们的评价就会急剧上升。",
	"If the characters have accumulated any treasure while in the lair, either from victims or from unoccupied areas, the queen demands its return. She doesn't hold a grudge as long as the characters give it back.": "如果角色在巢穴中积累了任何财宝，无论是从受害者身上还是从未被占领的区域，女王都会要求他们归还。只要角色归还，她就不会记恨。",
	"If the mission isn't ruined by how they conduct themselves prior to this first audience, the queen allows the characters to circulate through the lair for a brief time to give all the occupants a chance to pass their own judgment. Beyond this point, the only ways the characters can improve their score hereafter are by succeeding on Charisma checks (see \"{@area Goodwill Tour|182|x}\" below) and perhaps tipping the scales by offering the queen some of their valuables or the use of their services.": "如果任务没有被他们在第一次觐见之前的行为所破坏，女王会允许角色在巢穴中短暂停留，让所有的人都有机会通过自己的判断。在这之后，人物可以提高他们的分数的唯一方法是通过魅力检查（见下面的\"{@area Goodwill Tour|182|x}\"）和也许通过向女王提供一些他们的贵重物品或使用他们的服务来使天平倾斜。",
	"Killed lizardfolk adults": "杀死蜥蜴人的成年人",
	"−1 per victim": "每个受害者-1",
	"Killed hatchlings": "被杀死的幼虫",

	"Arrived accompanied by hatchlings": "伴随着孵化出的幼鸟到来",
	"After the characters meet the queen, she gives them 24 hours to prove their worth and win the lizardfolk's trust by visiting and interacting with occupants of the lair. Successful Charisma checks during this activity can add to the characters' points and help sway the lizardfolk into an alliance with Saltmarsh. For the best possible outcome, the characters must win over most or all the occupants of the lair, including its two most important individuals.": "在人物见到女王后，女王给他们24小时来证明他们的价值，并通过访问和与巢穴中的居民互动来赢得蜥蜴人的信任。在这个活动中，成功的魅力检查可以增加角色的积分，并帮助动摇蜥蜴人与Saltmarsh的联盟。为了获得最好的结果，人物必须赢得巢穴中大部分或所有的人，包括两个最重要的人。",
	"To earn the trust of an NPC ({@creature Sauriv|GoS} or {@creature Othokent|GoS}) or a group ({@creature Lizardfolk Commoner|GoS|commoners}, {@creature Lizardfolk Shaman||shamans}, other lizardfolk, locathah, or merfolk), one or more characters must display their good intentions to that individual or group consistently for at least 3 hours. At the end of that time, a character can then attempt a Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check against a DC that depends on the group or individual in question (see the table below). On a successful check, the characters earn progress toward achieving the alliance. On a failed check, they don't lose any ground, but the character who made that check, along with any who helped on the check, cannot try to gain that group's or individual's trust again.": "为了赢得一个NPC（{@creature Sauriv|GoS}或{@creature Othokent|GoS}）或一个团体（{@creature Lizardfolk Commoner|GoS|commoners}、{@creature Lizardfolk Shaman||shamans}、其他蜥蜴人、Locathah或merfolk）的信任，一个或多个角色必须向该个人或团体持续展示他们的好意，至少3小时。在这段时间结束时，一个角色可以尝试进行魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查，检查的DC取决于相关的团体或个人（见下表）。如果检定成功，角色就会在实现联盟的过程中获得进展。如果检定失败，他们不会失去任何优势，但进行检定的角色，以及任何帮助检定的人，都不能再尝试获得该团体或个人的信任。",

If they fall short at the end of the 24 hours, there are a couple of other ways (see below) that they can get to the required number.": "如果角色能够通过足够数量的成功检查将他们的分数提高到50分，那么他们与蜥蜴人的关系就会变得友好，联盟就可以正式建立。如果他们在24小时结束时没有达到要求，还有其他一些方法（见下文）可以使他们达到所需的数字。",
	"If the characters have exhausted their opportunities to impress the lizardfolk but don't have the needed 50 points, {@creature Othokent|GoS} might be willing to cooperate if the characters offer her tribute from their personal treasures (not including loot from the lair). For every 10 gp in coins, gems, and other valuables they offer, the characters gain 1 point. Consumable magic items earn 5 points and permanent ones 10 points, provided that the items have direct application for battling the sahuagin.": "如果角色已经用尽了讨好蜥蜴人的机会，但没有所需的50分，（%0%）可能会愿意合作，如果角色从他们的个人财物（不包括巢穴的战利品）中向她进贡。他们每提供10戈比的硬币、宝石和其他贵重物品，人物就会获得1分。消耗性的魔法物品可获得5分，永久性的可获得10分，只要这些物品能直接用于与萨瓦金人作战。",
	"Another way the characters can earn points is by defeating monsters in the marsh that threaten the lizardfolk, demonstrating both their skill and their good intentions.": "人物获得积分的另一种方式是击败沼泽中威胁蜥蜴人的怪物，既展示他们的技能，也展示他们的善意。",
	"In particular, the great crocodile called {@creature Thousand Teeth|GoS} is an ongoing problem for the tribe.

Stage encounters in the marsh as you see fit, involving trolls, ogres, or bullywugs. The characters earn {@dice 2d6} points for every troll slain, {@dice 1d6} for each ogre, and {@dice 1d6} for every three bullywugs.": "蜥蜴人在沼泽中还有其他敌人。如果角色们认真地试图成功完成任务，但却落入了一些坏运气（骰子低），你可以安排他们通过寻找和击败这些其他生物来获得一些最后的分数。在沼泽地上演你认为合适的遭遇战，涉及巨魔、食人魔或恶霸。每杀死一个巨魔，人物就能获得{@dice 2d6}分；每杀死一个食人魔，人物就能获得{@dice 1d6}分；每杀死三个恶霸就能获得{@dice 1d6}分。",

	"The influence of the aged lizardfolk minister has kept the tribe from fracturing because of ideological differences (see \"{@area Politics Among the Lizardfolk|17e|x}\" above). If the characters kill him instead of trying to communicate with him, they are set upon by the rest of the tribe just as if they had killed the queen. After the intruders are put down or chased off, the tribe succumbs to infighting as the shamans try to muster more support for their point of view. There is no longer a chance of Saltmarsh becoming allied with the lizardfolk, and if the shamans succeed in their takeover they will withdraw the tribe from any discussions of alliance with other races as well.": "年迈的蜥蜴人部长的影响使部落没有因为意识形态的差异而分裂（见上文\"（%0%）\"）。如果角色们杀了他，而不是试图与他沟通，他们就会被部落里的其他成员陷害，就像他们杀了女王一样。在入侵者被放倒或赶走之后，部落就会陷入内讧，因为巫师们试图为自己的观点争取更多支持。萨尔马什不再有机会与蜥蜴人结盟，如果巫师们的接管成功，他们也会让部落退出与其他种族结盟的讨论。",
	"This adventure provides the characters with opportunities for extensive interaction with a variety of lizardfolk. The lizardfolk are generally wary of strangers, but are of neutral alignment and are far from dimwitted or bloodthirsty. Here are a few resources you can use to add flavor to the party's experiences with the lizardfolk by giving depth and dimension to the occupants of the lair. They are designed to help you with adventure preparation and to enable you to create distinctive lizardfolk NPCs on the spot.": "这次冒险为人物提供了与各种蜥蜴人广泛交流的机会。蜥蜴人通常对陌生人有戒心，但他们是中立的，而且远非愚蠢或嗜血的。这里有一些资源，你可以通过赋予巢穴中的居民以深度和维度，来增加派对与蜥蜴人的经验。它们旨在帮助你进行冒险准备，并使你能够在现场创建独特的蜥蜴人NPC。",
	"To customize the lizardfolk in the lair, use the personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws from the character backgrounds in {@book chapter 4|PHB|4|Backgrounds} of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} as a starting point. The acolyte background is ideal for shamans, the soldier background for warriors, and the hermit and outlander backgrounds for commoners. If the result of a die roll seems inappropriate, such as the \"Raised by wolves\" trait in the outlander background, roll again.": "要定制巢穴中的蜥蜴人，请使用{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的角色背景中的个性特征、理想、纽带和缺陷作为起点。圣徒背景非常适合萨满，士兵背景适合战士，而隐士和外乡人背景适合平民。如果掷骰子的结果看起来不合适，比如外乡人背景中的 \"被狼养大 \"的特征，就再掷一次。",
	"In addition, you can use the Lizardfolk Quirks table below to determine a personality quirk for a lizardfolk character or to inspire a unique mannerism.": "此外，你可以使用下面的蜥蜴人怪癖表来确定蜥蜴人角色的个性怪癖，或激发出独特的举止。",

	"You enjoy eating your food while it's still raw and wriggling.": "你喜欢在食物还未成熟和蠕动的时候吃它。",
	"Lizardfolk take their names from the Draconic language. They use simple descriptives granted by the tribe based on an individual's notable deeds or actions. For example, Garurt translates as \"axe,\" a name given to a lizardfolk warrior who defeated an orc and claimed his foe's weapon. A lizardfolk who likes to hide in a stand of reeds before ambushing an animal might be called Achuak, which means \"green,\" to describe how she blends into the foliage. Young lizardfolk are often given a name by one of the community's elders, but take an adult name not long after reaching their first decade.": "蜥蜴人的名字来自于德拉克斯语。他们使用部落根据个人的显著事迹或行动而授予的简单描述。例如，加鲁特（Garurt）被翻译成 \"斧头\"，这个名字是给一个打败兽人并夺取敌人武器的蜥蜴人战士的。一个喜欢在伏击动物前躲在芦苇丛中的蜥蜴人可能被称为Achuak，意思是 \"绿色\"，以描述她如何融入树叶中。年轻的蜥蜴人通常由社区的一位长者给他们起一个名字，但在他们到达第一个十年后不久就会取一个成年的名字。",
	"Lizardfolk make no distinction between male and female in their naming conventions, and any number of individuals can have the same name. The Lizardfolk Names table includes a number of examples, all of which are used for either gender.": "蜥蜴人在他们的命名惯例中不区分男性和女性，任何数量的个体都可以有相同的名字。蜥蜴人的名字表包括一些例子，所有这些名字都可以用于任何性别。",
	"Because each name has meaning beyond its use as an identifier, you can use an individual's name as a starting point for its description. (Each name's meaning in Common is given in parentheses.) Someone named Kosj might be exceptionally scrawny, while a lizardfolk dubbed Usk might wear scraps of plate armor scavenged from a foe.": "因为每个名字都有其作为识别符以外的意义，你可以用一个人的名字作为描述的起点。(括号内为每个名字的通用含义。)名为Kosj的人可能特别瘦弱，而被称为Usk的蜥蜴人可能穿着从敌人身上搜来的板甲碎片。",

The characters enter the lair and explore it.": "角色们与萨尔马什镇议会会面，议会雇佣他们去调查蜥蜴人的巢穴。通过海路或陆路，人物前往海角，到达蜥蜴人的巢穴。角色们进入巢穴并进行探索。",
	"Through interaction with the lizardfolk or their guests, the characters can earn either the lizardfolk's enmity or their respect. If they proceed cautiously and without violent intent, they will likely be taken to an audience with the queen, {@creature Othokent|GoS}. Depending on how they have conducted themselves to that point, the characters might be able to improve their reputation with the tribe by using their diplomatic skills.": "通过与蜥蜴人或他们的客人互动，人物可以赢得蜥蜴人的敌意或尊重。如果他们谨慎行事，没有暴力倾向，他们可能会被带去见女王，（%0%）。根据他们在这一点上的表现，人物可能会通过外交技巧提高他们在部落的声誉。",
	"The best possible outcome is for the characters to befriend the lizardfolk and for {@creature Othokent|GoS} to invite them (and Saltmarsh) to join the alliance. If the characters can't accomplish this through acts of contrition and persuasion, they might be able to salvage the situation by offering the lizardfolk treasure. In addition, the tribe has a big problem out in the marsh, and the characters might be able to prove themselves by taking care of things, thus earning {@creature Othokent|GoS}'s gratitude.": "最好的结果是人物与蜥蜴人交好，并且（%0%）邀请他们（和萨尔马什）加入联盟。如果人物不能通过忏悔和劝说的行为来实现这一目标，他们也许可以通过向蜥蜴人提供财宝来挽救局面。此外，部落在沼泽地有一个大问题，角色们也许可以通过处理事情来证明自己，从而赢得（%%）的感激。",
	"In the Greyhawk campaign setting, where the town of Saltmarsh is located, the lizardfolk lair is a coastal promontory adjacent to the Dunwater River.": "在灰鹰（Greyhawk）战役的设定中，萨尔马什（Saltmarsh）镇的所在地，蜥蜴人的巢穴是一个毗邻邓沃特河的海岸岬角。",
	"The appearance of lizardfolk near Saltmarsh in the Basura Swamp endangers the town's access to profitable masthin shoots and dragonshards. The uneasy peace threatens to break down, renewing the conflict between settlers and lizardfolk. An alliance in Q'barra can involve disparate factions, as complex agendas bring together the Cyran diaspora, dragonmarked houses, and even the Inspired.": "蜥蜴人出现在巴苏拉沼泽的萨尔马什附近，危及到该镇对有利可图的马辛笋和龙须菜的获取。不安的和平有可能被打破，定居者和蜥蜴人之间的冲突再次爆发。Q'barra的联盟可能涉及到不同的派别，因为复杂的议程将Cyran的散居者、有龙纹的房子，甚至是启发者联系在一起。",
	"A lizardfolk lair has been discovered close to the town of Saltmarsh, threatening the town and traffic on the High Road. The dwarves of Thornhold at the southern end of the Mere of Dead Men might be concerned allies or remain distant and cautious, more wary of the machinations of the Margaster family in Waterdeep than of a few lizardfolk in the swamps. A marsh encounter with the undead of the Mere of Dead Men could replace the bullywug ambush. As an alternative location, Daggerford to the south of Waterdeep works because it already has a history with the lizardfolk.": "在靠近萨尔马什镇的地方发现了一个蜥蜴人的巢穴，威胁着该镇和公路上的交通。位于死人谷南端的索恩霍尔德的矮人可能会成为相关的盟友，或者保持距离和谨慎，他们对水底世界的玛格丽特家族的阴谋比对沼泽里的几只蜥蜴人更加警惕。在沼泽地与死人谷的亡灵相遇，可以取代恶霸的伏击。作为一个替代地点，沃特德普南部的达格福德（Daggerford）也可以，因为它已经有了与蜥蜴人的历史。",
	"Lizardfolk have been discovered in the Blight Marsh of Karameikos. Because the marsh sits on the border of the Five Shires, the halfling folk might play a larger role in the alliance. Baron von Hendriks of Fort Doom might be aware of the lizardfolk, even indirectly supporting them. As an alternative, set the adventures in Darokin's other port. Port Tenobar is larger than Saltmarsh but a good deal seedier, and the vast Malpheggi Swamp is an excellent location for lizardfolk and other creatures to hide.": "在卡拉米科斯的枯萎沼泽中发现了蜥蜴人。由于沼泽位于五郡的边界，半身人可能在联盟中发挥更大的作用。杜姆堡的冯-亨德利克斯男爵可能知道蜥蜴人，甚至间接支持他们。作为替代方案，将冒险设定在达洛金的另一个港口。特诺巴港比萨尔特马什港大，但也是个好地方，广阔的马尔菲吉沼泽是蜥蜴人和其他生物的绝佳藏身之地。",
	"Be sure not to prematurely reveal to the characters that the lizardfolk do not constitute a real threat to Saltmarsh or its inhabitants, or that the newly purchased weaponry is not for use against humanity and its allies. The characters are expected to discover the real intentions of the lizardfolk from the various clues in the adventure as they play through it. Unless their mission turns into an utter failure, they must eventually become aware that there is a war brewing between the lizardfolk (and their allies) and the sahuagin.": "请注意不要过早向人物透露蜥蜴人并不构成对萨尔马什或其居民的真正威胁，也不要透露新购买的武器不是用来对付人类及其盟友的。角色们应该在冒险过程中从各种线索中发现蜥蜴人的真正意图。除非他们的任务彻底失败，否则他们最终必须意识到蜥蜴人（和他们的盟友）与萨瓦金人之间正在酝酿一场战争。",
	"Unless indicated otherwise in a particular encounter area, the characters must not be informed about the name or nature of the sahuagin. Rather, you should provide only a general physical description of these creatures when an encounter occurs. If {@creature Oceanus|GoS} is with the party, on the other hand, he recognizes any sahuagin on sight. He has general (biased) knowledge as to their nature, and he readily identifies such creatures to the characters.": "除非在某一特定的遭遇区中另有说明，否则人物不得被告知萨瓦金的名称或性质。相反，你应该在遭遇时只提供这些生物的一般身体描述。另一方面，如果{@creature Oceanus|GoS}和队伍在一起，他能一眼认出任何萨瓦金人。他对这些生物的性质有一般的（偏颇的）了解，而且他很容易向人物识别这些生物。",
	"The inset on map 3.1 shows the location of the lizardfolk colony and features in the vicinity. (Even if the characters have not been through {@adventure The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh|GoS|1}, they still receive the map—it was given over to the town council by the individuals who defeated the smugglers.)": "地图3.1上的插图显示了蜥蜴人聚居地的位置和附近的特征。(即使人物没有通过{@adventure The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh|GoS|1}，他们仍然会收到地图--它是由击败走私者的个人交给镇议会的。)",
	"The party can choose between two methods of traveling to the lair.": "当事人可以选择两种方法前往巢穴。",
	"The distance from Saltmarsh to the lair is about ten miles as the crow flies, and a sea journey would take about three hours in normal conditions.": "从萨尔马什到巢穴的距离，从鸦片上看大约是10英里，在正常情况下，海上航行大约需要三个小时。",
	"If the characters want to travel by sea, the council places at their disposal a modified {@vehicle keelboat} with two pairs of oars and a step-down mast, large enough to accommodate the characters and any reasonable amount of equipment they want to take with them. Navigation and propulsion of the craft is handled by two members of the town guard ({@creature Guard||guards}), who are assigned by the council to sail or row the boat. The guards do not disembark when the characters reach their destination, instead staying with the boat to keep it under their control and guard the party's return trip.": "如果人物想走海路，议会就会为他们安排一艘改装过的{@vehicle keelboat}，上面有两对船桨和一根向下的桅杆，大到足以容纳人物和他们想带的任何合理数量的装备。这艘船的航行和推进由两名镇上的卫兵（{@creature Guard||guards}）负责，他们被议会指派来开船或划船。当人物到达目的地时，卫兵并不下船，而是留在船上，将其置于自己的控制之下，并保护当事人的回程。",
	"While they are at sea, as their boat approaches the promontory, the characters see a well-traveled and relatively dry track (at the point marked {@i A} on the map) leading from the coast. It disappears into the marshland interior.": "当他们在海上时，当他们的船接近海角时，人物看到一条走得很好的、相对干燥的小路（在地图上标有（%0%）的位置）从海岸线上通向。它消失在了沼泽地的内部。",
	"Once they are within 40 feet of the promontory's northern coastline, the party spies another track running up to the middle elevations of the promontory, where it disappears behind a clump of tall grasses and brightly flowering shrubs (leading to the hidden entrance marked {@i D} on the map).": "一旦他们进入海角北部海岸线的40英尺范围内，他们就会发现另一条通往海角中间高地的轨道，它在一丛高大的草和开着鲜艳花朵的灌木后面消失了（通往地图上标有（%0%）的隐藏入口）。",
	"They also note, as they approach by sea, a 15-foot wide, 6-foot high sea cave entrance on the northeastern tip of the promontory (marked {@i E} on the map). A careful approach to the sea cave goes unnoticed until after the characters disembark and enter the entrance tunnel. Once inside {@area area 49|233|x}, they are likely to be discovered immediately.": "当他们从海上接近时，还注意到在海角的东北端有一个15英尺宽、6英尺高的海洞入口（地图上标有（%0%））。小心翼翼地接近海洞，直到人物上岸并进入入口通道后才被注意到。一旦进入（%1%），他们很可能立即被发现。",
	"The overland journey is longer because of the {@quickref difficult terrain||3}. Dozens of trails follow a route roughly parallel to the coast and 100 to 400 yards away from it. Because of the terrain, it will take the party about 12 hours to travel from Saltmarsh to the ford over the Dunwater River (marked {@i B} on the map). This time does not account for resting but does allow for slow movement at times when the mist inhibits visibility. As long as the characters move at this rate, the route is easily followed—there is no risk of straying in a wrong direction.": "由于{@quickref difficult terrain||3}的原因，陆路行程更长。几十条小路沿着与海岸线大致平行的路线，离海岸线有100到400码的距离。由于地形的原因，队伍从萨尔马什到邓沃特河上的岔口（地图上标有（%%1%））大约需要12小时。这个时间不包括休息时间，但允许在雾气阻碍视线的时候缓慢移动。只要人物以这样的速度前进，路线就很容易遵循--没有走错方向的风险。",
	"From the ford, the characters can see in the distance the entrance to the cave of the giant lizards (marked {@i C} on the map, {@area area 22|1e2|x} of the lair).": "从岔路口，人物可以看到远处巨蜥洞穴的入口（在地图上标有（%0%），（%1%）的巢穴）。",
	"If the characters' route takes them through the marsh, they eventually pass close to the temporary lair of a band of bullywugs. Bullywug scouts patrol the area and, unless spotted, return to the larger group after identifying the adventurers to organize an ambush.": "如果角色们的路线是穿过沼泽地，他们最终会靠近一伙恶霸的临时巢穴。恶霸哨兵在该地区巡逻，除非被发现，否则在确定冒险者的身份后会返回大队，组织一场伏击。",
	"The bullywugs are a roving band but they have set up a defensive camp here because they have happened upon a considerable treasure. Rather than risk traveling through the swamp with their discovery, thus making themselves vulnerable to bandits or brigands, they made camp to guard the treasure until their great king could travel here from their lair ten miles away, deep in the swamp. The bullywugs dared make no move regarding the items they have found until he gives his decision on the matter.": "小霸王是一支游荡的队伍，但他们在这里建立了一个防御性营地，因为他们偶然发现了一个相当大的宝藏。他们不愿意冒险带着他们的发现穿越沼泽，从而使自己容易受到土匪或强盗的攻击，而是扎营守卫宝藏，直到他们伟大的国王从十英里外的沼泽深处的巢穴来到这里。恶霸们不敢对他们发现的物品采取任何行动，直到他对此事做出决定。",
	"The king, Gulpa'Gor, arrived the night before the party struck out into the marsh. He and his advisor, Arrp, inspected the treasure. When the king learns of the party's presence, he and Arrp stage a competition to see who can waylay the tasty interlopers.": "国王Gulpa'Gor在队伍出发到沼泽地的前一天晚上到达。他和他的顾问Arrp检查了宝藏。当国王得知队伍的存在时，他和Arrp举行了一场比赛，看谁能骗过这些美味的插队者。",
	"The party is assaulted by three waves of bullywugs:": "队伍遭到了三波恶霸的袭击。",

	"{@b Wave 2}. Arrp ({@creature bullywug croaker|GoS}; see {@adventure appendix C|GoS|10}) and two {@creature Bullywug||bullywugs} arrive shortly after the first wave is defeated. They make a grand show of battling the characters, and Arrp grins at the king whenever he is effective in combat.": "{@b Wave 2}. Arrp({@creature bullywug croaker|GoS}; see {@adventure appendix C|GoS|10})和两个{@creature Bullywug||bullywugs}在第一波被打败后不久就到了。他们大张旗鼓地与这些人物作战，每当国王在战斗中取得成效时，亚尔普就会对他咧嘴笑。",
	"{@b Wave 3}. Gulpa'Gor ({@creature bullywug royal|GoS}; see {@adventure appendix C|GoS|10}) arrives mounted on a {@creature giant toad} shortly after Arrp and his guards are slain.": "{@b Wave 3}. Gulpa'Gor ({@creature bullywug royal|GoS}; see {@adventure appendix C|GoS|10})在Arrp和他的卫兵被杀后不久骑着{@creature giant toad}到达。",
	"The king tries to communicate with the party with harsh croaks and aggressive gestures, boasting of his prowess in battle. A dozen more bullywugs appear at the edge of the battlefield but do not approach. An equally aggressive response from the characters, verbally or through gestures, and a successful DC 16 Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) or Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check convinces the king to retreat and take his remaining warriors with him.": "国王试图用刺耳的呱呱声和咄咄逼人的手势与队伍交流，吹嘘自己的战斗力。还有十几只恶霸出现在战场边缘，但没有靠近。角色们通过口头或手势做出同样积极的回应，并成功通过DC16魅力（{@skill Intimidation}）或魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查，说服国王撤退并带着他剩下的战士一起撤退。",
	"If the king is attacked or goaded into battle (on a failed check), the other bullywugs do not interfere. His steed is trained in combat, and when allowed to act independently, it attacks the nearest enemy. Gulpa'Gor tries to skewer the characters from astride the toad's back, commanding it to move when necessary, but mostly letting it do as it pleases. The remaining bullywugs flee into the marsh if their leader dies.": "如果国王被攻击或被怂恿参加战斗（在检查失败的情况下），其他恶霸不会干预。他的骏马受过战斗训练，当被允许独立行动时，它会攻击最近的敌人。Gulpa'Gor试图从蟾蜍的背上串联起这些人物，必要时指挥它移动，但大多数时候让它随心所欲。如果它们的首领死了，剩下的恶霸蟾蜍就会逃到沼泽地里。",
	"The bullywugs' treasure consists of 325 pp and a {@item helm of underwater action|GoS} (see {@adventure appendix B|GoS|9}) in which the loose coins are contained.

	"The lizardfolk in this colony are more developed than others of their kind, as demonstrated by their ability to use sophisticated weaponry and their readiness to ally with other races when necessity dictates. They still lag behind more intelligent races, however. The construction of their lair is simplistic, employing only basic materials; most floors, walls, and ceilings are of rammed earth, and the furnishings are spartan.": "这个殖民地的蜥蜴人比其他同类更发达，这表现在他们有能力使用复杂的武器装备，并在必要时准备与其他种族结盟。然而，他们仍然落后于更多的智能种族。他们的巢穴建造得很简单，只使用了基本材料；大多数地板、墙壁和天花板都是用夯土建造的，家具也很简陋。",

They jab their weapons toward the characters threateningly and attack within 2 rounds unless the characters can convey their nonhostile intentions. If the characters can't communicate verbally, they might accomplish this with placating gestures, such as sheathing their weapons. They will certainly get their point across if they throw down their weapons in a convincing gesture of submission. In that case, the characters are bound and taken as prisoners, to await an audience with the queen.": "蜥蜴人对入侵者并不欢迎。除非队伍中有人会说Draconic语，或者角色遇到会说普通话的住户，否则蜥蜴人不会浪费时间去想角色在他们的巢穴中做什么。他们威胁性地将武器刺向角色，并在2个回合内发动攻击，除非角色能表达他们的非敌对意图。如果角色不能进行口头交流，他们可以通过安抚性的手势来实现这一目的，例如将他们的武器出鞘。如果他们扔下武器，做出令人信服的屈服姿态，他们肯定会明白自己的意思。在这种情况下，这些人物就会被捆绑起来，作为囚犯，等待女王的接见。",

Reading the book conveys no special advantage to the characters, and most of the contents are too obscure for full comprehension.": "{@i The Occult Properties of Gemstones}大法师坦塞的书(10 gp)。这本书是坦塞的另一本关于他最喜欢的主题（财富）的书，是继他之前的书{@i The Magical Properties of Gemstones}（在{@adventure The Sinister Secret of Saltmarsh|GoS|1}的房子里的{@area area 2|0d4|x}找到）之后的又一本。如果玩家想让他们的角色阅读这本书，并要求了解书中的一些内容，你的想象力可能会被拉长! 阅读这本书不会给角色带来特别的好处，而且大部分内容都太过晦涩难懂，无法完全理解。",
