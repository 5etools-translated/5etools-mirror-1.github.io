	"Saltmarsh is a nondescript fishing village tucked away on the southern coast of the Kingdom of Keoland. For several generations, Keoland was a formidable military power. Its superior cavalry and bold knights pushed the kingdom's borders outward to the north, west, and east. Each successful campaign increased both the crown's wealth and power, and each one in turn drew the kingdom's attention even farther north. The southern coastal regions of Keoland remained a backwater.": "萨尔马什是一个不起眼的渔村，隐藏在基奥兰王国的南部海岸。几代人以来，Keoland是一个强大的军事力量。它优秀的骑兵和勇敢的骑士将王国的边界向北、向西、向东推进。每一次成功的战役都增加了王室的财富和权力，而每一次战役又将王国的注意力吸引到更远的北方。Keoland的南部沿海地区仍然是一个落后的地方。",
	"The crown's benign neglect allowed piracy and banditry to flourish. Saltmarsh and similar towns kept to fishing, content to maintain a low profile and avoid governmental entanglements. Decades ago, the pirates who prowled the waters off Saltmarsh grew strong enough to create their own realm, a loose confederacy known as the Hold of the Sea Princes. With the rise of that nation came increased raids on Saltmarsh and its neighbors. The Sea Princes' raiding ships pillaged the coast for more slaves to support their growing realm, and Saltmarsh suffered heavily. The memories of those times loom heavily over the area, and the locals' hatred of the Sea Princes runs deep.": "王室的善意忽视使海盗和强盗行为得以猖獗。萨尔马什和类似的城镇一直在捕鱼，满足于保持低调，避免政府的纠缠。几十年前，在萨尔马什附近水域游荡的海盗们逐渐强大到足以创建自己的王国，一个松散的联盟，被称为 \"海王子之家\"。随着这个国家的崛起，对萨尔马什和其邻国的袭击也越来越多。海王子们的袭击船在海岸上掠夺更多的奴隶，以支持他们不断增长的王国，萨尔特马什遭受了严重的损失。那个时代的记忆深深地笼罩着这个地区，当地人对海王子的恨意也很深。",
	"In time, Keoland's victories in the north gave way to a string of defeats in which its neighbors pushed the kingdom back to its original boundaries. With the world closing in, King Kimbertos Skotti looked to the south and saw unchecked banditry and a rising pirate nation. The crown struck peace treaties with its former foes to the north, raised a navy, and dealt a sharp check to the ambitions of the Sea Princes—but the conflict is by no means over.": "随着时间的推移，Keoland在北方的胜利让位于一连串的失败，它的邻国将王国逼回了它原来的边界。随着世界的逼近，国王金伯托斯-斯科蒂向南方看去，看到了不受控制的强盗行为和一个崛起的海盗国家。王室与北方的前敌人签订了和平条约，组建了海军，并对海王子的野心进行了猛烈的打击，但冲突还没有结束。",
	"King Skotti has decreed that the pirates must be put down, the sea lanes secured, and trade cultivated. If Keoland cannot prosper as a military force, it must grow mightier as a center of trade.": "斯科蒂国王已经下令，必须镇压海盗，确保海上通道的安全，并培育贸易。如果基奥兰不能作为一支军事力量而繁荣，它就必须作为一个贸易中心而变得更加强大。",
	"Saltmarsh, remote though it might be from the center of power in Keoland, is entering a new phase of its life as it reacts to the king's plans. The crown's agents want to expand the village's port and make it a prime location for trade with the world beyond. In another recent development, a band of dwarves—bearing a decree from the king himself—have arrived and begun to excavate the hills and seaside cliffs near town, looking for precious metals. If their work bears fruit as expected, the mine stands to become a major factor in the village's—and, indeed, the entire region's—prosperity.": "萨尔马什，尽管它可能远离Keoland的权力中心，但随着对国王计划的反应，它的生活正进入一个新阶段。国王的代理人想扩大村庄的港口，使其成为与世界其他地方进行贸易的主要地点。在另一个最近的发展中，一队矮人--带着国王本人的命令--已经到达，并开始挖掘城镇附近的山丘和海边的悬崖，寻找贵重金属。如果他们的工作如期取得成果，该矿将成为该村--实际上是整个地区繁荣的一个主要因素。",
	"Naturally, not all of Saltmarsh's residents feel the same way about the recent developments in and around their community, which is the key issue that affects their lives and livelihood. Although the recent changes stand to bring new prosperity to the area, many locals don't want to see their home changed. At the same time, as an undercurrent through all the goings-on, agents of the secretive and mysterious Scarlet Brotherhood work to thwart Keoland's ambitions while advancing their own.": "自然，并不是所有Saltmarsh的居民都对他们社区内和周围的最新发展有同样的感受，这也是影响他们生活和生计的关键问题。虽然最近的变化站在为该地区带来新的繁荣，但许多当地人并不希望看到他们的家园被改变。同时，作为贯穿所有事件的暗流，秘密和神秘的血色兄弟会的代理人努力挫败基奥兰的野心，同时推进他们自己的野心。",
	"Saltmarsh's future rests in the hands of three factions that compete for supremacy. Two of the factions represent the opposing sentiments that have grown in town in recent years. The third is a secret group that seeks to undermine Saltmarsh and seize control of the region. These factions' struggles play out in the day-to-day lives of the townsfolk and the political maneuvering of Saltmarsh's town council.": "萨尔马什的未来掌握在三个争夺霸权的派别手中。其中两个派别代表了近年来在镇上发展起来的对立情绪。第三个是一个秘密组织，试图破坏萨尔马什并夺取对该地区的控制权。这些派别的斗争在镇民的日常生活和萨尔马什镇议会的政治活动中得到了体现。",
	"The traditionalist faction is an alliance of the prominent fishing families and merchants in town, along with the workers who rely on those industries for a living. The traditionalists remember the terrible times during the Sea Princes' raids and have no desire to see the crown's ambitions lead to open war. The smugglers who operate in the area tend to be traditionalists. Most pose as merchants and rely on their local contacts to move goods through the region without interference from the town guard or royal agents. Smuggling has long been an easy way to make money in Saltmarsh, and locals generally look the other way, seeing it as a victimless crime.": "传统派是由镇上著名的渔业家族和商人，以及依靠这些行业谋生的工人组成的联盟。传统派记得海王子突袭时的可怕时光，不希望看到王室的野心导致公开战争。在该地区经营的走私者往往是传统主义者。大多数人冒充商人，依靠他们在当地的关系，在不受城镇卫队或皇家特工干扰的情况下在该地区运输货物。走私长期以来一直是在萨尔马什赚钱的一个简单方法，当地人一般都睁一只眼闭一只眼，把它看作是一种无害的犯罪。",
	"The traditionalists would like to see the dwarves' mining efforts fail and interest from the north wane, so that Saltmarsh's dependable fishing trade can thrive and the smugglers in the area are left alone. They resent the intrusion of outsiders seeking to transform Saltmarsh and undoubtedly drain power from the fishing families to give to dwarves and merchants.": "传统主义者希望看到矮人的采矿工作失败，来自北方的兴趣减弱，这样萨尔马什可靠的渔业贸易就能蓬勃发展，而该地区的走私者就不会受到影响。他们憎恨外来者的入侵，试图改造萨尔马什，无疑是将权力从渔民家庭中抽出，交给矮人和商人。",
	"This faction relies on two council members for representation. Eda Oweland leads the faction and can count on Gellan Primewater to back her up. Anders Solmor is young and unpredictable, but he has supported the traditionalists' viewpoint on most issues.": "这个派别依靠两名理事会成员来代表。艾达-奥维兰领导着这一派别，可以指望盖兰-普里姆沃特支持她。安德斯-索尔莫（Anders Solmor）年轻且难以预测，但他在大多数问题上都支持传统主义者的观点。",
	"At their best, traditionalists are community-minded folk who want Saltmarsh to return to its old way of doing things, arguing that the town has survived for a century by sticking to its original priorities. They suffered mightily due to the Sea Princes' depredations and remember the days when the crown turned a blind eye to their troubles. Their loyalty to the king runs second to their desire for peace and quiet.": "传统主义者最好是有社区意识的民间人士，他们希望萨尔马什恢复其旧有的行事方式，认为该镇通过坚持其原有的优先事项，已经生存了一个世纪。他们因海王子的掠夺而遭受了巨大的损失，并记得王室对他们的麻烦视而不见的日子。他们对国王的忠诚仅次于对和平与安静的渴望。",
	"Eda (CG female human {@creature noble}) is the current senior member of the town council, as well as the owner of three large fishing boats. She has lived in Saltmarsh all her life and has been elected to the council three times. She is a gruff, pragmatic woman whose graying hair is cut short and whose face bears the marks of a life lived outdoors. Eda is keenly interested in expanding Saltmarsh's fishing industry, her sights set on a wild section of the coast where she hopes to build a new dock. She is suspicious of the dwarves' mining enterprise and doubts it will amount to much.": "艾达（CG女性人类（%0%））是目前镇议会的高级成员，同时也是三艘大渔船的船主。她一生都生活在萨尔马什，曾三次当选为议会成员。她是一个粗暴、务实的女人，她的白发被剪短，脸上有户外生活的痕迹。艾达对扩大萨尔马什的渔业非常感兴趣，她的目光投向了海岸的一个荒芜地段，希望在那里建造一个新的码头。她对矮人的采矿业心存疑虑，并怀疑它是否会有什么结果。",
	"Eda swears like a sailor when she is frustrated or angry, and the folk in town who support her appreciate her willingness to stick up for them. Despite her temper, she respects those who keep their cool. Anyone who stands up to her wins her respect. Those who try to flatter her earn her contempt.": "艾达在沮丧或愤怒时像水手一样说脏话，镇上支持她的人很欣赏她愿意为他们撑腰。尽管她的脾气不好，但她尊重那些保持冷静的人。任何站在她面前的人都能赢得她的尊重。那些试图奉承她的人则赢得她的蔑视。",
	"If anyone in town needs help, Eda is the first to volunteer. She believes community binds people together and allows them to ride out the fiercest storm.": "如果镇上有人需要帮助，艾达是第一个志愿者。她相信社区将人们联系在一起，使他们能够度过最猛烈的风暴。",
	"Saltmarsh is Eda's home. She would protect it to her dying breath and wants its people to prosper.": "萨尔马什是艾达的家。她会誓死保护它，并希望它的人民能够繁荣。",
	"Eda is suspicious of outsiders, and she is too quick to trust those familiar to her.": "艾达对外人充满怀疑，她太急于相信她熟悉的人。",
	"Gellan (NE male human {@creature noble}) is a well-spoken, dapper older gentleman with a neatly trimmed beard and a fancy wardrobe. With his cunning instincts, he has positioned his family to become the most prominent merchants in town, but he now faces an intractable problem. Gellan made his fortune through smuggling, his textile and lumber exports serving as a cover for his illegal activities. When Saltmarsh was a sleepy backwater, he could operate with impunity. Now that Saltmarsh has attracted attention from the outside world, he sees business growing more difficult and less profitable.": "盖兰（NE男性人类{@creature noble}）是一个能说会道、潇洒的老先生，有着修剪整齐的胡须和花哨的衣橱。凭借他狡猾的直觉，他将自己的家族定位为镇上最著名的商人，但他现在面临一个棘手的问题。盖兰通过走私发了财，他的纺织品和木材出口成为其非法活动的掩护。当萨尔马什还是一个沉睡的落后地区时，他可以肆无忌惮地经营。现在，萨尔马什已经吸引了外部世界的注意，他看到生意越来越难做，利润越来越低。",
	"Over the years, Gellan has cultivated relationships with a number of contacts among the Sea Princes. His ships move illicit goods, including slaves, between their realm and Keoland. Gellan takes care to keep this side of his business quiet, since any hint of involvement with slave traders would mean the end of his days in Saltmarsh, if not his life.": "多年来，盖兰与海族王子中的一些联系人培养了关系。他的船在他们的王国和基奥兰之间运送非法货物，包括奴隶。盖兰小心翼翼地对他的这部分业务保持沉默，因为任何与奴隶贩子有关的暗示都意味着他在萨尔马什的日子要结束了，如果不是他的生命。",
	"Gellan seeks to keep his smuggling cartel functioning with as little interference as possible. Having a seat on the council puts him in a perfect position to maintain his business while supporting all aspects of the traditionalists' agenda. His popularity in the faction is second only to that of Eda Oweland.": "Gellan试图在尽可能少的干扰下保持他的走私集团的运作。在议会中拥有一个席位使他处于一个完美的位置，既能维持他的生意，又能支持传统派的各方面议程。他在该派别中的声望仅次于艾达-欧文兰。",
	"Because Gellan is the wealthiest man in town, he garners a great deal of popular support from the many feasts, entertainments, and other diversions he supports with expenditures and donations. He pretends to care little for the daily functions of the council, defaulting to throw his support behind Eda's position. In truth, this deference is a ruse he uses to mask his efforts to shield his smuggling operation.": "由于盖兰是镇上最富有的人，他从许多宴会、娱乐活动和其他他用支出和捐款支持的娱乐活动中获得了大量的民众支持。他假装不关心议会的日常职能，默认自己支持艾达的立场。事实上，这种尊重是他用来掩盖他努力保护自己的走私活动的诡计。",
	"Gellan loves to play the role of the foppish dandy. He enjoys fine wine, good food, and the latest fashions. He is a patron of the arts and spends lavishly to support festivals, plays, and concerts.": "盖兰喜欢扮演轻浮的花花公子的角色。他喜欢美酒、美食和最新的时尚。他是艺术的赞助人，花钱大手大脚地支持节日、戏剧和音乐会。",
	"For Gellan, beauty and elegance are everything. He derives great enjoyment from watching the town enjoy his events.": "对盖兰来说，美丽和优雅就是一切。他从看着镇上的人享受他的活动中获得了极大的乐趣。",
	"Gellan values his reputation above all else. He wants to be admired by the people of Saltmarsh.": "盖兰把自己的声誉看得比什么都重要。他希望被萨尔马什的人们所敬仰。",
	"Greed colors every action Gellan takes. He can't turn down a chance to turn a profit, even if it means breaking the law. Gellan secretly believes that even if he is caught, he can spend his way back into the town's good graces by throwing the biggest, most extravagant festival Saltmarsh has ever seen.": "贪婪使盖伦的每一个行动都充满色彩。他不能拒绝赚钱的机会，即使这意味着违反法律。Gellan秘密地相信，即使他被抓，他也可以通过举办萨尔马什有史以来最大、最奢侈的节日来重新获得镇上的好感。",
	"The traditionalists simply want things to remain the same. If they had their way, the dwarves would go home, the guard would stick to dealing with monsters rather than hassling honest traders, and the crown would go back to dreaming of conquests in the north. The more things change, the more this faction resorts to open protest and resistance.": "传统主义者只是希望事情保持不变。如果他们有自己的方式，矮人就会回家，卫队就会坚持对付怪物而不是骚扰诚实的商人，而王室就会回去梦想在北方的征服。事情越是变化，这个派别就越是诉诸于公开抗议和抵抗。",
	"A group of fishers accosts dwarves and other outsiders, demanding they leave town or else.": "一群渔民与矮人和其他外来者搭讪，要求他们离开镇子，否则。",
	"Gellan Primewater imports a variety of exotic flowers that he uses to decorate the town, while also distributing fresh tropical fruit free of charge to the townsfolk.": "杰兰-普里姆沃特进口各种异国花卉，用来装饰小镇，同时还免费向镇民分发新鲜的热带水果。",
	"A fire breaks out in town, and Eda Oweland raises funds to support those who lost their homes.": "镇上发生了一场火灾，艾达-欧沃兰筹集资金以支持那些失去家园的人。",
	"A fishing boat goes missing with its crew. They were smuggling a haul of black pearls, and Gellan wants his treasure back without risking his cover.": "一艘渔船和它的船员失踪了。他们偷运了一批黑珍珠，盖兰想在不危及自己身份的情况下拿回他的财宝。",
	"A bountiful catch leads to a day of feasting and reconciliation, giving the factions a chance to make amends.": "丰富的收获导致了一天的盛宴与和解，给各派别一个弥补的机会。",
	"A bungled smuggling operation lands a few respected people in jail, leading to near riots as fishers gather in a huge mob to effect a breakout.": "一次失败的走私行动使一些受人尊敬的人被关进了监狱，导致渔民们聚集成巨大的暴徒来实现突围，从而导致了近乎暴乱。",
	"A horrible sea creature has been sighted, keeping many crews at the docks until it disappears. Anyone who tracks it down and slays it would be a hero. Gellan pledges a magic weapon to its slayer.": "有人发现了一种可怕的海洋生物，让许多船员在码头上呆着，直到它消失。任何追踪到它并杀死它的人都会成为英雄。Gellan将一件魔法武器承诺给它的杀手。",
	"Several fishing crews have gone missing. The locals demand that Keoland dispatch a squadron of ships to track down the slavers from the Sea Princes who surely kidnapped them.": "几名捕鱼人员失踪了。当地人要求Keoland派遣一个中队的船只去追踪肯定绑架了他们的海王子的奴隶主。",
	"The loyalists consist of newcomers who arrived from the northern reaches of Keoland, loyal to King Kimbertos Skotti. They feel that the town should focus on becoming a useful asset to the crown and value the good of the kingdom before the good of the region. The town guard, the dwarves, and the local farmers are generally loyalists.": "忠诚的人由从Keoland北部到达的新来者组成，他们忠于Kimbertos Skotti国王。他们认为该镇应该专注于成为王室的有用资产，并将王国的利益置于该地区的利益之上。镇上的卫兵、矮人和当地的农民一般都是忠诚的。",
	"The loyalists care about security. They want to keep Keoland's enemies at bay while ensuring law and order. They see smuggling as a key problem, as it enriches the Sea Princes at the cost of the royal treasury and the efforts of honest merchants.": "忠诚的人关心安全问题。他们希望在确保法律和秩序的同时，将Keoland的敌人挡在门外。他们认为走私是一个关键问题，因为它以皇家国库和诚实商人的努力为代价使海族王子发财。",
	"Above all else, the members of this faction put their faith in law. They exert influence through the town guard, though they remain within their legal authority.": "最重要的是，这个派别的成员把他们的信仰放在法律上。他们通过城镇警卫队施加影响，尽管他们仍在法律授权范围内。",
	"At their best, the loyalists want to grow Saltmarsh into a trading hub with a higher standard of living and improved security. If the Sea Princes are held in check and the sea lanes cleared of threats, Saltmarsh can grow to become the envy of the world.": "在他们最好的情况下，忠诚者希望将萨尔马什发展成一个贸易中心，拥有更高的生活水平和更好的安全。如果海王子被控制住了，海上通道的威胁被清除了，萨尔马什可以发展成为世界上令人羡慕的地方。",
	"At their worst, the loyalists see the people of Saltmarsh as a barrier to growth. The locals are little more than allies of the Sea Princes, traitors who for too long have evaded the crown's notice. If they were to do as the loyalists tell them, then perhaps this {@creature fish|GoS}-reeking pile of a town could become something respectable.": "在他们最坏的情况下，效忠者将萨尔马什的人民视为发展的障碍。当地人只不过是海王子的盟友，是长期以来躲避王室注意的叛徒。如果他们按照效忠者的要求去做，那么这个{@creature fish|GoS}臭气熏天的小镇也许会成为一个值得尊敬的地方。",
	"Eliander (LN male human {@creature gladiator}) fought in the royal army of Keoland, where he earned a name driving the wild things of the Dreadwood away from the settled lands. Eliander suffered a tremendous injury to his leg in a battle against an owlbear and now walks upon a finely carved wooden peg. Despite his injury and advancing age, the burly captain of the Saltmarsh town guard remains an imposing figure. Eliander is a local celebrity thanks to his facility with languages, and he is often called upon by the town's various organizations to assist with translations. He is fully literate in Common, Dwarvish, Gnomish, Elvish, and Halfling; he can also speak and understand Orc and Draconic.": "Eliander（LN男性人类（%0%））在Keoland的皇家军队中作战，在那里他赢得了将Dreadwood的野物从定居的土地上赶走的名声。在一次与猫头鹰熊的战斗中，埃利安德的腿部受到了巨大的伤害，现在他是在一个精雕细琢的木桩上行走的。尽管他的伤势和年龄不断增长，这位粗壮的萨尔马什镇卫队队长仍然是一个威严的人物。埃利安德是当地的名人，这要归功于他的语言能力，他经常被镇上的各种组织要求协助进行翻译。他精通普通话、矮人语、地精语、精灵语和半身人语；他还能说和听懂兽人语和龙语。",
	"In a crisis, Eliander Fireborn might put the good of the crown above local rule. He possesses a royal writ that allows him to seize authority over the town guard in case of an emergency. He is loath to use it, as the locals might react to his seizure of power with an open revolt.": "在危机中，埃利安德-弗尔邦可能会把王室的利益置于地方统治之上。他拥有一份皇室令状，允许他在紧急情况下夺取镇上卫队的权力。他不愿意使用它，因为当地人可能会对他夺取的权力做出公开的反应。",
	"Caution guides Eliander's thoughts and his every action. He recognizes that Saltmarsh is on the verge of tremendous growth, but he sees the influence of the Sea Princes behind every stroke of misfortune. Slow and steady wins the day, as he likes to say.": "谨慎指导着埃利安德的思想和他的每一个行动。他认识到萨尔马什正处于巨大发展的边缘，但他看到每一次不幸的背后都有海王子的影响。正如他喜欢说的那样，缓慢而稳定地赢得今天。",
	"Eliander is a faithful servant of the crown. The law must be obeyed, as faithful service and iron discipline are the surest ways to maintain peace and order.": "Eliander是王室的忠实仆人。必须遵守法律，因为忠实的服务和铁的纪律是维持和平与秩序的最可靠的方法。",
	"Once he gives his word, Eliander keeps it to the death. Honor is his life, and treachery earns his wrath.": "一旦他作出承诺，埃利安德就会死守承诺。荣誉是他的生命，而背叛会招致他的愤怒。",
	"Eliander is stubborn to a fault. Once he sets his mind to a belief or a course of action, little can dissuade him.": "埃利安德顽固到了极点。一旦他决定了一个信念或行动方针，就没有什么可以劝阻他。",
	"The leader of the newly established mining operation in Saltmarsh is an iron-willed dwarven woman named Manistrad (LN female dwarf {@creature veteran}). She runs the mining outfit from a small office near the edge of town. Manistrad is a competent leader, as well as a savvy miner with a knack for pulling off impossible jobs. She's convinced that the veins of silver found in the cliffs near Saltmarsh are indicative of more valuable stones deeper in the rock. She was once a fearsome warrior, and she's not above delivering a few well-placed blows to ensure her orders are followed.": "在萨尔马什新成立的矿业公司的领导人是一位意志坚定的矮人妇女，名叫玛尼斯特拉德（LN女矮人（%0%））。她在镇子边缘的一个小办公室里经营采矿业。玛尼斯特拉是一个称职的领导者，也是一个精明的矿工，擅长完成不可能完成的工作。她相信在萨尔马什附近的悬崖上发现的银矿脉表明在岩石深处有更有价值的石头。她曾经是一个可怕的战士，她也不忘给自己几下，以确保她的命令得到遵守。",
	"Manistrad occupies an awkward place on the council. She was placed in her position by royal decree; the crown decided that if Saltmarsh is to support a mining operation, the miners would need a political voice. A more diplomatic figure might have smoothed over the tension, but Manistrad has little patience and sees the rest of the council, save for Eliander, as rustic dullards.": "马尼斯特拉在议会中占据了一个尴尬的位置。她的职位是由皇家法令安排的；王室决定，如果萨尔马什要支持采矿作业，矿工就需要一个政治上的声音。一个更有外交手腕的人物可能会抚平紧张局势，但玛尼斯特拉却没有什么耐心，在她看来，除了埃利安德之外，议会的其他成员都是土里土气的呆子。",
	"Manistrad is a woman of few words. She is curt and quick, yet she gives every person who comes before the council a fair accounting. She's nobody's fool.": "马尼斯特拉是个寡言的女人。她说话客气而迅速，但她给每一个来到议会的人一个公平的交代。她不是任何人的傻瓜。",
	"Curiosity and hard work mark everything Manistrad does. Once she is interested in a topic, she is relentless in learning about it. Obstacles don't slow her down.": "好奇心和努力工作是马尼斯特拉德做任何事情的标志。一旦她对某一主题感兴趣，她就会不遗余力地去了解它。障碍并没有拖累她。",
	"Manistrad is intensely loyal to her kinfolk and the mining operation her clan seeks to establish here. Threats to the livelihood of the dwarves earn her wrath.": "玛尼斯特拉对她的亲属和她的族人试图在这里建立的采矿业非常忠诚。对矮人生计的威胁会引起她的愤怒。",
	"Manistrad has little patience; she tends to push for quick results over a more measured approach.": "马尼斯特拉德没有什么耐心；她倾向于推动快速的结果，而不是更有分寸的方法。",
	"The loyalists are focused on two things: ensuring that the dwarven mine is a success, and clamping down on smuggling to keep the Sea Princes in check. The mine is the most precious commodity in the region for this faction, and its members do everything they can to support it. If word of any Sea Prince activity reaches the loyalists, they are quick to meet the threat.": "忠心耿耿的人专注于两件事：确保矮人矿场的成功，以及打击走私以控制海王子的行为。对该派别来说，矿场是该地区最珍贵的商品，其成员尽其所能支持它。如果任何海王子活动的消息传到忠心耿耿的人那里，他们会迅速迎接威胁。",

	"For decades, this group has been concocting a conspiracy to spread fear, chaos, and uncertainty across the land. When the time is right, the Brotherhood will strike to seize the reins in kingdoms all across the world. Already its assassins have slain those who might oppose their sinister plans.
