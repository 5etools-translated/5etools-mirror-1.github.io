	"More than one thousand years ago, the wizard {@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM} (see {@adventure appendix A|WDMM|25}) journeyed from a distant land to the base of Mount Waterdeep, perhaps acceding to the whispered summons of providence. Some believe he hailed from the nearly forgotten empire known as the Cradlelands. In ages past, humanity spread from the Cradlelands across Faerûn, originating from what is now the Plains of Purple Dust, a wasteland birthed out of a conflict with the gods. Others give Halaster less ancient origins, placing him among the early wizards of Netheril, or asserting that he came from a southern nation long since buried by sand and time. Whatever his origin, scholars have recorded that Halaster brought with him seven apprentices to Mount Waterdeep.": "一千多年前，巫师{@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM}（见{@adventure appendix A|WDMM|25}）从遥远的地方来到沃特德普山脚下，也许是接受了天意的低声召唤。有人认为他来自几乎被遗忘的帝国，即摇篮地带。在过去的岁月里，人类从摇篮地蔓延到法鲁恩，起源于现在的紫尘平原，那是一片因与诸神冲突而产生的荒地。也有人认为哈拉斯特的起源不那么古老，将他置于尼瑟尔的早期巫师之中，或者断言他来自一个早已被沙子和时间掩埋的南方国家。无论他的出身如何，学者们都记录了哈拉斯特带着他的七个学徒来到沃特德普山。",
	"With the Seven guarding his back, Halaster tapped into his immense power to summon beings from other planes of existence to help him build a wizard's tower to dwarf all other wizard's towers. But as the seasons wore on, the Seven saw less and less of their enigmatic master. Halaster continued to use fell creatures from distant planes for tunneling and other construction beneath his tower, and the wizard kept the nature of most of his underground dealings a secret from the Seven. Eventually, Halaster's exploration broke into the Underhalls, a complex of tunnels and rooms built by the dwarves around a mithral mine beneath Mount Waterdeep. The architects of the Underhalls, the Melairkyn clan, had long ago been killed or dispersed, and warring duergar and drow had settled in the ruins. Halaster began a crusade against both the drow and the duergar, participating in wild hunts with extraplanar allies through the tunnels. The stubborn duergar dug in until the mithral was largely mined out; then they abandoned the Underhalls, leaving the drow to fight Halaster and his minions alone. The Mad Mage rounded up the remaining dark elves, trapping some of their souls for use in his dark magic, while twisting the bodies and enslaving the minds of others. Once he had wrung the drow of their usefulness, {@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM} tunneled on, ever downward, indulging his inexplicable compulsion for delving deeper and deeper into the mountain.": "在七人组的保护下，哈拉斯特利用他巨大的力量，从其他存在的星球上召唤生命，帮助他建造一座巫师塔，使所有其他巫师塔相形见绌。但随着季节的推移，七人组越来越少地看到他们神秘的主人。哈拉斯特继续利用来自遥远星球的堕落生物在他的塔下开凿隧道和进行其他建设，而且这位巫师对他的大部分地下交易的性质都对七人保密。最终，哈拉斯特的探索闯入了地下大厅，这是一个由矮人在沃特迪普山下的密特拉矿周围建造的隧道和房间群。地下城的设计者--梅莱尔金（Melairkyn）氏族，很早以前就被杀死或驱散了，交战的杜尔加人和乌鸦在废墟中定居。哈拉斯特开始了对乌鸦和duergar的讨伐，与星外盟友一起参与了穿越隧道的疯狂狩猎。顽固的杜尔加人一直挖到米塔尔石被基本开采出来；然后他们放弃了地下大厅，留下乌鸦独自与哈拉斯特和他的爪牙战斗。疯法师围捕了剩余的黑暗精灵，将他们中的一些灵魂困在他的黑暗魔法中，同时扭曲了其他人的身体，奴役了他们的思想。一旦他榨干了乌鸦的用处，{@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM}就继续挖隧道，一直往下挖，沉浸在他那莫名其妙的强迫症中，越挖越深的山。",
	"Using his underground complex as a base of operations, Halaster traveled to other planes and distant lands, collecting strange and dangerous creatures to live as prisoners, servants, or guardians in Undermountain. Populating and defending the dungeon became an obsession. Over time, the mage's preoccupation with Undermountain electrified his eccentricities and infused him with an air of unconcealable madness.": "哈拉斯特利用他的地下建筑群作为行动基地，前往其他星球和遥远的地方，收集奇怪和危险的生物，作为囚犯、仆人或地下山的守护者生活。填充和保卫地牢成为一种痴迷。随着时间的推移，法师对地下山的专注使他的怪癖变得更加强烈，并给他注入了一种难以掩饰的疯狂气息。",
	"Halaster's apprentices came and went. Some left only to return—inexplicably drawn down into Undermountain's depths. Others remained by his side. As they began dedicating more attention to their private obsessions, madness settled into their souls as well.": "哈拉斯特的学徒们来了又走。有些人离开后又回来了--莫名其妙地被卷入地下山的深处。其他人则留在了他身边。当他们开始将更多的注意力投入到他们的私人痴迷中时，疯狂也进入了他们的灵魂。",
	"During the years Halaster quested on other planes and sequestered himself in his tunnels, his magnificent tower and its surrounding walls fell into ruin. In time, the city now known as Waterdeep developed in the shadow of Mount Waterdeep and spread down to the harbor. As the city sprawled outward over the years, it came to surround the ruins of Halaster's home. Undermountain was known to those early settlers, and they often sent criminals into its endless depths as punishment. So it was for many years, until an intrepid adventurer named Durnan delved into the labyrinth beneath the tower and returned alive, laden with riches and countless harrowing tales. Durnan used his new fortune to demolish the remnants of Halaster's tower and built an inn over the well he had used to descend into Undermountain, and call it the Yawning Portal. Durnan owns and operates the inn and tavern to this day, serving patrons and inviting the brave and foolish alike to test their mettle in the Dungeon of the Mad Mage.": "在哈拉斯特在其他星球上探险和把自己关在隧道里的这些年里，他那座宏伟的塔和周围的墙壁都变成了废墟。随着时间的推移，现在被称为沃特德普的城市在沃特德普山的阴影下发展起来，并延伸到港口。随着城市多年来向外扩张，它开始围绕着哈拉斯特的家园废墟。早期的定居者们都知道山下，他们经常把罪犯送入无尽的深渊作为惩罚。就这样过了很多年，直到一个叫杜南的无畏的冒险家深入塔下的迷宫，并活着回来，带着财富和无数令人痛苦的故事。杜南用他的新财富拆除了哈拉斯特塔的残骸，并在他下到地下山的那口井上建造了一家旅馆，并将其称为 \"打哈欠的门户\"。杜南至今拥有并经营着这家客栈和酒馆，为顾客提供服务，并邀请勇敢的人和愚蠢的人在疯狂法师的地下城中测试他们的能力。",
	"Where Waterdeep stands today, there once stood Aelinthaldaar, the capital city of the ancient elven kingdom of Illefarn. When the elves left, they used a powerful spell to erase all traces of their capital. This spell had the unintended side effect of creating a permanent knot in the Weave, the fabric through which all magic is channeled. This knot lies deep underground and isn't something that can be seen, felt, or undone, but it can cause madness to bloom in the minds of mortal beings who dwell near it for too long. The knot permeates Undermountain, and the madness it causes typically manifests as an obsession with the dungeon itself. Those affected by the knot in the Weave exhibit a subconscious desire to remain in or near the dungeon. Halaster and several of his apprentices fell prey to this obsession, as did many Melairkyn dwarves and Durnan, the proprietor of the Yawning Portal. Not all creatures that dwell in Undermountain succumb to its madness, and those who do aren't even aware that the dungeon has them in its clutches.": "在Waterdeep今天矗立的地方，曾经有Aelinthaldaar，古代精灵王国Illefarn的首都。当精灵们离开时，他们用一个强大的咒语抹去了他们首都的所有痕迹。这个咒语有一个意外的副作用，那就是在 \"编织 \"中创造了一个永久的结，所有的魔法都是通过这个结传导的。这个结位于地下深处，不是可以看到、感觉到或解开的东西，但它会导致在它附近居住太久的凡人的头脑中绽放出疯狂。这个结渗透到地下山，它所导致的疯狂通常表现为对地牢本身的迷恋。那些受编织之结影响的人，会在潜意识中表现出对留在地牢或靠近地牢的渴望。哈拉斯特和他的几个学徒都是这种痴迷的牺牲品，许多梅莱尔金矮人和打哈欠门户的主人杜南也是如此。并非所有居住在阴山的生物都会屈服于它的疯狂，而那些屈服于它的生物甚至不知道地牢已经把他们抓在手里。",
	"The Yawning Portal, a famous inn and tavern located near the eastern slope of Mount Waterdeep, derives its name from a 40-foot-diameter well that descends into the first level of Undermountain. Located in the center of the taproom, the well was once the outer shell of Halaster's mighty tower, which was demolished long ago. Its sheer walls are made of old mortared stones. Next to this gaping orifice hangs a winch with a simple rope-and-pulley mechanism that Durnan, the proprietor, uses to lower adventurers down the shaft and (sometimes) pull them up again. Durnan controls the winch himself and will transport only one adventurer at a time. The trip takes 10 rounds, down and up. The rope is stained with old blood and long enough to reach all the way to the floor of the dark room at the bottom of the 140-foot shaft ({@area level 1, area 1|035|x}).": "打哈欠的门，是位于沃特德普山东坡附近的一家著名的客栈和酒馆，其名字来自于一口直径40英尺的井，这口井下到了地下山的第一层。这口井位于酒馆的中央，曾经是哈拉斯特强大的塔楼的外壳，很久以前就被拆除了。它的峭壁是由古老的石块砌成的。在这个缺口的旁边，挂着一个绞盘，上面有一个简单的绳索和滑轮装置，老板杜南用它把冒险者从井里放下去，（有时）再把他们拉上来。杜南亲自控制绞盘，每次只运送一个冒险者。这趟旅程需要10个回合，向下和向上。绳子沾满了旧血，足够长，可以一直伸到140英尺井底的黑暗房间的地板上（{@area level 1, area 1|035|x}）。",
	"Durnan charges adventurers 1 gp each to descend into the well, whether they opt to use the rope or not. The return trip also costs a piece of gold, sent up in a bucket in advance. He also readily accepts coin from patrons who want to place grisly bets on adventurers who dare explore Undermountain, and their odds of returning alive. \"Five gold dragons says they're back before a tenday, minus the fighter, the wizard, and the cleric!\" is the flavor of commentary often heard amid gales of drunken laughter.": "无论冒险者是否选择使用绳索，杜南都会收取每人1金币的下井费。回程的费用也是一块金子，事先放在桶里送上去。他也很乐意接受那些想在敢于探索地下山的冒险者身上下赌注的顾客的钱币，以及他们活着回来的几率。\"五条金龙说他们会在一个工作日之前回来，其中不包括战士、巫师和牧师！\"这是在醉醺醺的笑声中经常听到的评论的味道。",
	"The walls of the well are crumbly but have abundant handholds and footholds. They can be scaled without climbing gear with a successful DC 15 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check. No check is needed to enter Undermountain by using the rope-and-pulley system.": "井壁很脆弱，但有丰富的手掌和脚掌。只要成功地进行DC15力量({@skill Athletics})检查，就可以在没有攀登装备的情况下攀登。使用绳索和滑轮系统进入山下时不需要检查。",
	"Adventurers who hang around the Yawning Portal often find work delving into Undermountain on the errands of others. The characters might have their own reasons for venturing into the Mad Mage's dungeon, but the adventure hooks described in this section can be used as further motivation. These hooks are divided into two categories: starting quests and future quests. Adventurers are under no obligation to accept or complete any of these quests, though the promised rewards are often substantial enough to be tempting.": "在打哈欠门附近游荡的冒险者经常会因为别人的差事而找到深入山下的工作。角色们可能有自己的理由进入疯狂法师的地牢，但本节所述的冒险钩子可以作为进一步的动机。这些钩子分为两类：起始任务和未来任务。冒险者没有义务接受或完成任何这些任务，尽管承诺的奖励往往足够诱人。",
	"Starting quests are available to characters from the outset of their experience with Undermountain. Any of the quest givers described below might approach the characters shortly after their arrival at the Yawning Portal. The characters can accept as many or as few starting quests as they want. Based on the needs of your campaign, you might even introduce some starting quests of your own.": "角色们从一开始就可以在山下的体验中获得起始任务。下面描述的任何一个任务提供者都可能在角色到达哈欠门后不久接近他们。角色可以根据自己的意愿接受更多或更少的起始任务。根据你活动的需要，你甚至可以引入一些你自己的起始任务。",

	"Obaya approaches the adventurers and offers to pay for any unwanted magic items they find in Undermountain.

The amount she's willing to pay is based on the item's rarity, as shown in the Magic Item Rewards table, and is nonnegotiable. Characters would be hard-pressed to find anyone willing to spend as much for these items as Obaya is, and she always pays in platinum pieces for ease of transport.": "欧巴雅走近冒险者，表示愿意为他们在山下找到的任何不需要的魔法物品付费。欧巴雅在沃特达维亚的银行里有自己的资金，可以在几个小时内为人物带给她的任何魔法物品支付丰厚的报酬。她愿意支付的金额是基于物品的稀有程度，如魔法物品奖励表所示，而且没有商量余地。角色们很难找到像奥巴亚这样愿意为这些物品花这么多钱的人，而且为了方便运输，她总是用铂金碎片支付。",

Although the Rosznar family is trying to regain its integrity and standing, several bad apples threaten to impede that progress with their sinister ventures. Esvele's brother, Kressando, was sent to Skullport to conduct secret meetings with the Xanathar Guild and gauge interest in setting up a slave trade in Skullport, far from the eyes of Waterdavian authorities.

	"If the characters find the throne (see {@area level 3, area 14c|1d9|x}) and inform Volo of its location, he shares this information with his elf friends, who express their gratitude by giving the party a beautifully crafted longbow and an elven quiver containing twenty silvered arrows. The bow bears the Elvish inscription \"{@i Al hond ebrath, uol tath shantar en tath lalala ol hond ebrath}.\" This phrase translates to \"A true friend, as the trees and the water are true friends.\" The elves eventually embark on their own expedition into Undermountain, with the goal of retrieving the throne.": "如果角色们找到了王座（见{@area level 3, area 14c|1d9|x}）并告知沃罗它的位置，他就会与他的精灵朋友们分享这一信息，而精灵朋友们为了表达他们的感激之情，就会送给他们一把制作精美的长弓和一个装有20支银色箭矢的精灵箭筒。弓上有精灵语的铭文\"（%1%）\"。这句话被翻译成 \"一个真正的朋友，就像树木和水是真正的朋友\"。精灵们最终踏上了自己的征程，进入地下山，目的是为了夺回王位。",

	"Joroth approaches the characters in plain clothes and asks them to keep their eyes open for Falkir's Fist, a band of four dwarf adventurers that disappeared in Undermountain over a year ago. The leader of the band, Falkir Gravelfist, is believed to have stolen a famous emerald called the Eye of the Spider from the Mirabarran embassy in Waterdeep weeks prior to his disappearance. Joroth believes Falkir is dead (divination spells have confirmed as much) but would like to see the gemstone returned to its proper owners to strengthen political ties between Waterdeep and Mirabar.": "乔罗斯穿着便装走近人物，要求他们留意法尔基尔之拳，这是一个由四个矮人冒险者组成的队伍，一年多前在地下山失踪了。这支队伍的首领法尔基尔-格雷夫里斯特（Falkir Gravelfist）被认为在失踪前几周从水底世界的米拉巴兰大使馆偷了一块著名的绿宝石--蜘蛛之眼。乔罗斯相信法尔基尔已经死了（占卜法术已经证实了这一点），但他希望看到宝石物归原主，以加强沃特德普和米拉巴的政治联系。",

He says the gemstone is a spherical emerald roughly three inches in diameter, with a small imperfection in its core shaped vaguely like a spider. The gemstone has no magical properties as far as he knows. Joroth offers the friendship of the Lords' Alliance as a reward, which can be useful if one or more of the characters find themselves in need of assistance in Waterdeep or another alliance city. (For more information on the Lords' Alliance and its role in Waterdeep, see {@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH}.)": "乔罗描述法尔基尔是一个特别粗壮的矮人，戴着野猪头形状的头盔。他说宝石是一个球形的祖母绿，直径大约有三英寸，核心有一个小瑕疵，形状隐约像一只蜘蛛。据他所知，这块宝石没有任何魔法特性。乔罗斯提供了领主联盟的友谊作为奖励，如果一个或多个角色发现自己在沃特迪普或其他联盟城市需要帮助，这可能会很有用。(关于领主联盟及其在沃特德普的作用的更多信息，请参见（%0%）。",

If the characters negotiate for more than Jalester's goodwill, they're also promised a {@item luck blade} with no wishes remaining. Jalester neglects to mention, however, that this weapon belongs to Mirt the Moneylender, one of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep. Mirt himself delivers the {@item luck blade} once the Runestone fragment is in Laeral's hands, but looks rather put out at the thought of parting with it. \"Perhaps you might trade it back for dinner at my mansion?\" he asks the characters politely. Allowing Mirt to keep his sword puts the Masked Lord in the characters' debt—a fine prize indeed for their efforts.": "他没有提到向他提供符文石碎片的金钱奖励；相反，Jalester向人物提供了他持久的友谊--考虑到他在城市守望的地位，这可以带来很多好处。如果人物在谈判中得到了比Jalester的善意更多的东西，他们也会被许诺一个（%0%），没有剩余的愿望。然而，贾利斯特忽略了一点，这把武器属于放债人米特，他是水底世界的假面领主之一。一旦符文石碎片到了拉伊尔手中，米特就会亲自送上(1%)，但一想到要和它分开，他就显得很不高兴。\"也许你可以用它来换取在我宅邸的晚餐？\"他礼貌地问道。允许穆特保留他的剑，让面具人领主欠下了人物的债--这的确是对他们努力的最好奖励。",

It's Lady Wylynd's recollection that a longtime ally of the Moonstar family, a bronze dragon named {@creature Glyster|WDMM}, was asked or told to find Vanrak and bring him back to Waterdeep to face justice. The dragon found Vanrak but could not wrest him from the depths of Undermountain. Instead, the dragon became corrupted by Shar's magic and was transformed into a shadow dragon named {@creature Umbraxakar|WDMM}.

Word of these telepathic intrusions has begun to spread throughout the city, gaining traction as more than just a mad rumor. Several of Durnan's regular patrons have spoken at length about it, and Durnan believes the source might be somewhere in Undermountain.

She fled, but Halaster dragged her back to Undermountain and trapped her in the Citadel of the Bloody Hand, a dungeon complex under Mount Waterdeep connected to Undermountain. Jhesiyra escaped her prison when its wards failed during the Spellplague. To hide from Halaster, she magically confined herself in the stones of Undermountain. She now exists in a bodiless state, inhabiting the very dungeon itself. Halaster is unaware of Jhesiyra's presence but also wonders over her disappearance following the Spellplague.": "地下城最伟大的秘密之一是杰西拉-凯斯泰尔哈普（Jhesiyra Kestellharp）的故事。她是哈拉斯特最有天赋的学徒之一，直到她清楚地知道哈拉斯特已经不可逆转地疯了。她逃走了，但哈拉斯特把她拖回了地下山，并把她困在了血手堡垒，这是水底山下与地下山相连的一个地牢建筑。在法术瘟疫期间，当监狱的防护装置失效时，杰西拉逃出了监狱。为了躲避哈拉斯特，她用魔法将自己限制在地下山的石头里。她现在以无躯体的状态存在，居住在地牢本身。哈拉斯特不知道杰西拉的存在，但也对她在法术之灾后的失踪感到疑惑。",
	"Jhesiyra's plan is to use adventurers to defeat Halaster so that she can seize control of Undermountain. To that end, she does everything in her power to keep adventurers in Undermountain alive. Her abilities are, however, limited in her current, bodiless form.": "杰西拉的计划是利用冒险者来打败哈拉斯特，这样她就可以夺取地下山的控制权。为了达到这个目的，她不惜一切代价让地下城的冒险者活着。然而，她的能力在她目前的无躯体状态下是有限的。",
	"Jhesiyra can exert control over Halaster's magic gates, keeping adventurers from passing through them if she thinks they lack the might needed to defeat the perils beyond. In terms of game rules, characters are prevented from passing through a gate when their experience level fails to meet a prerequisite (the recommended character level for which the dungeon level is designed). Any character who doesn't qualify is pushed back without being harmed when trying to step through the open gate. Only a {@spell wish} spell can allow a character to pass through. As the Dungeon Master, you can suspend this restriction and allow characters who don't meet the level prerequisite to pass through a gate, particularly if you think they have the resources to survive and overcome that dangers that await them.": "Jhesiyra可以对Halaster的魔法门进行控制，如果她认为冒险者缺乏击败门外危险所需的力量，就不让他们通过。就游戏规则而言，当角色的经验值不符合先决条件（地牢等级设计时推荐的角色等级）时，他们就无法通过大门。任何不符合条件的角色在试图跨过打开的大门时都会被推后而不受到伤害。只有{@spell wish}的法术才能让角色通过。作为地下城主，你可以暂停这一限制，允许不符合等级先决条件的角色通过大门，特别是如果你认为他们有足够的资源来生存并克服等待他们的危险。",
	"Jhesiyra can't stop characters from moving between dungeon levels by more conventional means.

These restrictions apply to magic items and artifacts that have properties that transport or banish creatures to other planes as well. Magic that allows transit to the Border Ethereal, such as the {@spell etherealness} spell, is the exception to this rule.

The room contains the following features:": "一扇暗门打开，露出一个10英尺见方的空隔间，一条5英尺宽的粗凿石隧道从这里通出去。隧道略微下降，直到到达一个闻起来像下水道的房间。这个房间里有以下特征。",

	"{@b Statue}. A wide alcove in the north wall contains a life-size statue of a sahuagin, submerged up to its chest in sewer water. The statue emits a dim purple radiance, its head is completely turned around, and one of its arms has broken off and is nowhere to be seen.": "{@b Statue}. 北墙有一个宽阔的凹槽，里面有一尊真人大小的萨瓦金雕像，被淹没在下水道的水中，直到胸部。雕像散发着暗淡的紫色光芒，它的头完全转过来了，它的一只手臂已经断掉，不知所踪了。",

The statue's arm broke off long ago and rests now against the west wall, concealed beneath the dark water.": "萨瓦金雕像周围的紫色光环是无害的，对雕像施放{@spell dispel magic}可以消除它。雕像的手臂很久以前就断了，现在靠着西墙，隐藏在黑水之下。",
	"The statue's head is hollow, with holes for eyes and a larger hole for its fanged mouth. Further inspection reveals that the head has screw threads and is removable. Previous adventurers managed to unscrew it halfway before being scared off by the gray ooze. Unscrewing and removing the head exposes a hidden, charred compartment in the statue's neck. The compartment contains melted wax from candles that were used to illuminate the statue's head like a jack-o'-lantern.": "雕像的头部是空心的，有眼睛的孔和一个较大的孔，是它的獠牙嘴。进一步检查发现，头部有螺纹，是可以拆卸的。以前的冒险者在被灰色渗出物吓跑之前，设法把它拧了一半。拧开并取下头部后，雕像的脖子上露出一个隐藏的、烧焦的隔间。这个隔间里有融化的蜡，这些蜡是用来照亮雕像的头部的，就像一个千斤顶。",
	"The water seeps through cracks in the ceiling of the alcove, drips down the walls, and accumulates in the west end of the room before slowly leaking out through smaller cracks in the floor. The water is tepid, and not fit for drinking unless a {@spell purify food and drink} spell is cast on it.": "水从凹室天花板的裂缝中渗出，顺着墙壁滴下，在房间的西端积聚，然后慢慢地从地板的小裂缝中漏出。水是温热的，不适合饮用，除非对它施以（%0%）的法术。",

It has two eye-holes bored into it at a height of 5 feet, allowing a creature to peer into {@area area 2a|03b|x} beyond.": "{@b Secret Door}. 从这边可以看到一扇通往南方的暗门（不需要检查能力）。它在5英尺的高度上有两个眼孔，可以让一个生物窥视到（1%）以外的地方。",
	"The longsword is easy to remove from the armor stand, requiring no ability check. A {@spell detect magic} spell reveals that the sword is magical. It sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. It also carries a curse that prevents its wielder from dropping it. If the blade is pried from its wielder's grasp, it instantly teleports back into the wielder's hand. The curse can be ended by casting a {@spell remove curse} spell or using similar magic on the sword's wielder, or by chopping off the hand that holds the weapon. The skeletal hand on the floor belonged to the orc who last held the sword.": "长剑很容易从盔甲架上取下，不需要检查能力。一个{@spell detect magic}的法术显示，这把剑是有魔力的。它在10英尺的范围内发出昏暗的光。它还带有一个诅咒，可以防止持剑者丢掉它。如果剑被从持剑者手中撬开，它就会立刻传送回持剑者的手中。诅咒可以通过对持剑者施展{@spell remove curse}的法术或使用类似的魔法来结束，或者通过砍掉持剑者的手来结束。地板上的骷髅手属于最后持有这把剑的兽人。",
	"Vent shafts in the ceiling connect to shop cellars in the city above. These passages carry voices from Waterdeep, but the sound is distorted so badly that words at one end can't be discerned by creatures at the other end. If the grills that cover the vent shafts are pried loose, a Tiny or gaseous creature could crawl through a shaft to escape Undermountain.": "天花板上的通风井连接到上面城市的商店地窖。这些通道传递着来自沃特迪普的声音，但声音被严重扭曲，一端的文字无法被另一端的生物辨别出来。如果覆盖通风井的栅栏被撬开，一个微小的或气态的生物就可以爬过通风井，逃离冥山。",
	"At the end of a long hall is a 50-foot-square room with five pillars made of mortared humanoid bones, painted black.

	"The deep alcoves and black pillars provide cover for the grells. As the characters move into the room, they can spot one or both grells by succeeding on a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check contested by the monsters' Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks. The grells are hungry and eagerly pursue fleeing prey. They have no treasure.": "深邃的凹槽和黑色的柱子为格莱尔人提供了掩护。当人物进入房间时，他们可以通过智慧（（%0%））检查和怪物的灵巧（（%1%））检查的成功来发现一只或两只蝼蛄。格雷尔人很饿，热衷于追赶逃亡的猎物。它们没有财宝。",
	"Several members of the Undertakers gang dwell here in their vampire disguises. If the {@creature bandit} keeping an eye on {@area area 1|035|x} through the secret door retreats here with news of the adventurers' arrival, add that individual to the forces arrayed here (one {@creature bandit captain}, six {@creature Bandit||bandits}, and two {@creature Doppelganger||doppelgangers}).

	"A {@spell detect magic} spell reveals the faintest, lingering trace of magic within both fragments of the staff. The staff can be repaired with a {@spell mending} cantrip. The first time the intact staff is held, it wails, \"Help! Thief! Criminal!\" before its magic fades forever. If the wailing occurs here, the creatures in {@area areas 6b|04b|x} and {@area 6c|04c} hear the noise and come to investigate.": "一个{@spell detect magic}的咒语揭示了法杖的两块碎片中最微弱的、挥之不去的魔法痕迹。这根法杖可以用{@spell mending}的咒语来修复。第一次拿起完整的法杖时，它会哀嚎：\"救命! 盗贼! 罪犯！\"然后它的魔力就永远消失了。如果哀号发生在这里，{@area areas 6b|04b|x}和{@area 6c|04c}的生物会听到声音并前来调查。",

	"A character who inspects the stone fresco and succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check discovers that one of the tiny dwarf figures is the top of a stone key slotted into a cavity that hides its teeth.

She reminds the adventurers that the Legion of Azrok has never once threatened Waterdeep—but the drow or the guild might leap at the chance to do just that.": "进入斯特罗姆库赫达尔西部（{@area area 21|205|x}）的冒险者会被带到阿兹罗克和鲁尔卡娜（{@area area 21n|21b|x}）面前，这是一种礼仪。在阿兹罗克保证他们在其定居点的安全后，鲁尔卡娜把他们带到一边，为安全归还她丈夫的魔法匕首提供奖励。她强调，如果没有这把匕首，入侵的乌鸦和Xanathar公会可能会征服斯特罗姆库赫杜尔并变得无比强大。她提醒冒险者，阿兹罗克军团从未威胁过水底世界，但乌鸦或公会可能会抓住机会这样做。",
	"Lurkana knows that the thieves who stole the dagger are duergar of Clan Ironeye, and she thinks they might be hiding in Skullport. (Characters who make discreet inquiries in Skullport can learn that a large contingent of duergar from Clan Ironeye resupplied in Skullport and drank ale at a local tavern called the Black Tankard before heading deeper into Undermountain. The tavern's tight-lipped duergar proprietor, Droon Stonedark, denies everything. The characters can catch up to the duergar of Clan Ironeye on level 6.)": "卢卡娜知道偷匕首的小偷是铁眼氏族的duergar，她认为他们可能躲在斯库尔波特。(在斯库尔波特谨慎询问的角色可以了解到，铁眼部族的一大批duergar在斯库尔波特进行了补给，并在当地一家名为 \"黑坦克 \"的酒馆喝了点啤酒，然后就深入到了地下山脉。酒馆老板Droon Stonedark对一切都讳莫如深，他否认了。人物可以在6级时追上铁眼氏族的duergar)。",
	"If the characters accept her quest, Lurkana suggests they search Skullport first and points them in the right direction (beyond {@area area 23|22b|x}). She also suggests that they speak with Skullport's ambassador to Stromkuhldur (the mind flayer in {@area area 21g|211|x}) to see if it knows anything. She cautions them not to harm the ambassador in any way, so as not to fray relations any further.": "如果人物接受了她的任务，卢卡娜建议他们先搜索斯库尔波特，并为他们指出正确的方向（超越（%0%））。她还建议他们与斯库尔波特的大使（Stromkuhldur）（位于{@area area 21g|211|x}中的心灵猎手）交谈，看看它是否知道什么。她告诫他们不要以任何方式伤害大使，以免进一步破坏关系。",
	"In exchange for the dagger, Lurkana is prepared to pay 1,000 gp delivered in a locked chest along with the key. If the characters demand more, she is willing to increase the payment to 1,500 gp and throw in two bugbears and five goblins as bodyguards and scouts. Unknown to Lurkana, two of the goblins have intellect devourers in their skulls and act as secret spies for Xanathar. The bugbears and other goblins serve the adventurers well, but being evil and greedy, they become increasingly difficult to control over time.": "作为对匕首的交换，卢卡娜准备支付1000金币，连同钥匙一起放在一个上锁的箱子里。如果角色们要求更多，她愿意将报酬提高到1,500金币，并加入两个虫人和五个地精作为保镖和侦察兵。卢卡纳不知道，其中两只地精的头骨里有智力吞噬者，并作为Xanathar的秘密间谍行事。虫熊和其他地精很好地服务于冒险者，但由于邪恶和贪婪，它们随着时间的推移变得越来越难以控制。",

	"Adventurers brought before Azrok are expected to offer tribute. He is more interested in oaths of fealty than in tangible gifts, but he accepts whatever he's offered.

If the characters want to retrieve the ring to complete a quest (see \"Search for {@area Kressando Rosznar|00d|x}\"), they'll have to kill Azrok, charm him into relinquishing it, or steal it while he's {@condition incapacitated}. The warlord does not give it up otherwise.": "阿兹罗克对这个提议很感兴趣，但发现克雷桑多居高临下。他杀死了这个贵族，因为他没有表现出应有的尊重。克雷桑多被开膛破肚的尸体被喂给了{@area area 17e|1ec|x}的奥特尤格，但阿兹罗克保留了手指作为战利品。如果人物想取回戒指来完成任务（见 \"寻找（%%1%）\"），他们必须杀死阿兹洛克，迷惑他放弃戒指，或者在他（%%2%）的时候偷走它。否则军阀是不会放弃它的。",
	"If the characters are looking for a safe place to rest and are on good terms with Azrok, Lurkana orders one of the goblins to escort them to {@area area 21i|214|x} or {@area 21l|217}.

	"The sound of screaming goblin children issues from small cracks in the walls of this building. Inside, two {@creature Goblin Boss||goblin bosses} are minding twenty goblin children (noncombatants).

	"Standing in front of the door to this chamber is a tired {@creature goblin} named Salt Nose, so named because he has white freckles on his broad snout.

	"Lurkana uses the banner as a form of punishment; she makes disobedient or incompetent underlings stand outside these quarters for hours or even days on end with no food, no water, and only the banner to keep them company. Salt Nose spilled a plate of food on Azrok's lap and fears that he will spend what little remains of his life here. Characters who take pity on him earn his trust, and he readily tells them where to find things in Azrok's Hold.

	"Wyllowwood is designed for four 8th-level characters. Those who defeat the monsters on this level should gain enough XP to reach 9th level. In some cases, defeating a monster can be accomplished without slaying it. If the characters strike a truce with a creature, award them XP as if they had defeated it in combat.": "Wyllowwood是为4个8级的角色设计的。在这一层打败怪物的人应该获得足够的XP值来达到第九层。在某些情况下，击败一个怪物可以不杀它。如果人物与怪物达成了休战协议，就像他们在战斗中击败了怪物一样给予他们XP。",
	"The characters will most likely arrive here by way of the River of the Depths, which they first encounter on level 4. Characters who follow the river must navigate rapids and small waterfalls to reach Wyllowwood.

	"In addition to dark caverns, this level contains forests of trees like those that grow on the surface.

Birds, insects, and tree-dwelling mammals live here alongside Wyllowwood's fiercer denizens.": "除了黑暗的洞穴之外，这一层还包含了像生长在地表的树木的森林。这些温带森林是由哈拉斯特用魔法创造的，高高在上的天空会让冒险者以为他们已经逃离了地下山，找到了回到地面的方法。鸟类、昆虫和住在树上的哺乳动物与怀洛伍德的凶猛居民一起生活在这里。",
	"The forests are real and nourished by magic, and Halaster regularly repopulates them with birds, insects, rodents, and larger mammals. The main caverns have 100-foot-high ceilings hidden by illusions that can't be dispelled. These illusions begin 30 feet above ground and create the impression of open sky where high walls and ceilings should be. The illusions flawlessly duplicate the sun, the moon, the stars, and clouds, though there is no wind or breeze to speak of. During the day, the warmth of the sun can be felt, and at night the temperature drops as one would expect. Despite appearances, the walls and ceilings are still very much in place, and a {@spell true seeing} spell or similar magic reveals them.": "这些森林是真实的，由魔法滋养，哈拉斯特定期用鸟类、昆虫、啮齿动物和较大的哺乳动物重新填充它们。主要洞穴有100英尺高的天花板，被无法驱散的幻觉所掩盖。这些幻象从离地面30英尺开始，在本应是高墙和天花板的地方创造出开阔天空的印象。这些幻象完美地复制了太阳、月亮、星星和云朵，尽管没有风或微风可言。白天，可以感受到太阳的温暖，而到了晚上，温度就会像人们所期望的那样下降。尽管表面上看，墙壁和天花板仍然很完好，一个{@spell true seeing}的咒语或类似的魔法就能揭示它们。",
	"A magic calendar stone in {@area area 6k|2d0|x} allows one to change the time of day, the weather, and the season in Wyllowwood's forests. {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} the archdruid (see \"What Dwells Here?\" below) is the only one permitted to use the calendar stone.

	"Undermountain is {@creature Wyllow|WDMM}'s home now, and all memory of the surface world has faded from her mind. She is distant but kind toward those who pass harmlessly through her domain, but turns violent whenever her forest or its peaceful denizens are threatened.

She can also summon six awakened trees from the forest with a whistle.": "山下现在是{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}的家，所有关于地面世界的记忆已经从她的脑海中消失了。她对那些无害地通过她的领地的人很疏远，但却在她的森林或其和平居民受到威胁时变得很暴力。在出发消灭入侵者之前，她会召集绿龙和狼人，用它们来软化她的对手。她还可以用口哨从森林中召唤出六棵被唤醒的树木。",
	"{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}'s displacer beast companion, Crissann, is named after a human mercenary whom the elf befriended many years ago.

	"{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} has conflicted feelings about Halaster. She is grateful to him for providing her a home and keeping Wyllowwood alive with his magic, but she blames him for Yinark's death.

Thus, she has given up any hope of being rid of him.": "{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}对哈拉斯特的感情很矛盾。她很感激他为她提供了一个家，并以他的魔法使怀洛伍德得以生存，但她又为尹纳克的死责怪他。她也很同情他，因为这个疯狂的法师似乎也被困在了他自己制造的监狱里。{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}认为他不再是人类，而是一个由纯魔法组成的不朽实体。因此，她已经放弃了摆脱他的任何希望。",

	"The village and its environs stood empty for years until a congregation of goblin werebats took residence in the caves around the buildings.
