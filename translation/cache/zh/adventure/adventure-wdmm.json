	"More than one thousand years ago, the wizard {@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM} (see {@adventure appendix A|WDMM|25}) journeyed from a distant land to the base of Mount Waterdeep, perhaps acceding to the whispered summons of providence. Some believe he hailed from the nearly forgotten empire known as the Cradlelands. In ages past, humanity spread from the Cradlelands across Faerûn, originating from what is now the Plains of Purple Dust, a wasteland birthed out of a conflict with the gods. Others give Halaster less ancient origins, placing him among the early wizards of Netheril, or asserting that he came from a southern nation long since buried by sand and time. Whatever his origin, scholars have recorded that Halaster brought with him seven apprentices to Mount Waterdeep.": "一千多年前，巫师{@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM}（见{@adventure appendix A|WDMM|25}）从遥远的地方来到沃特德普山脚下，也许是接受了天意的低声召唤。有人认为他来自几乎被遗忘的帝国，即摇篮地带。在过去的岁月里，人类从摇篮地蔓延到法鲁恩，起源于现在的紫尘平原，那是一片因与诸神冲突而产生的荒地。也有人认为哈拉斯特的起源不那么古老，将他置于尼瑟尔的早期巫师之中，或者断言他来自一个早已被沙子和时间掩埋的南方国家。无论他的出身如何，学者们都记录了哈拉斯特带着他的七个学徒来到沃特德普山。",
	"With the Seven guarding his back, Halaster tapped into his immense power to summon beings from other planes of existence to help him build a wizard's tower to dwarf all other wizard's towers. But as the seasons wore on, the Seven saw less and less of their enigmatic master. Halaster continued to use fell creatures from distant planes for tunneling and other construction beneath his tower, and the wizard kept the nature of most of his underground dealings a secret from the Seven. Eventually, Halaster's exploration broke into the Underhalls, a complex of tunnels and rooms built by the dwarves around a mithral mine beneath Mount Waterdeep. The architects of the Underhalls, the Melairkyn clan, had long ago been killed or dispersed, and warring duergar and drow had settled in the ruins. Halaster began a crusade against both the drow and the duergar, participating in wild hunts with extraplanar allies through the tunnels. The stubborn duergar dug in until the mithral was largely mined out; then they abandoned the Underhalls, leaving the drow to fight Halaster and his minions alone. The Mad Mage rounded up the remaining dark elves, trapping some of their souls for use in his dark magic, while twisting the bodies and enslaving the minds of others. Once he had wrung the drow of their usefulness, {@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM} tunneled on, ever downward, indulging his inexplicable compulsion for delving deeper and deeper into the mountain.": "在七人组的保护下，哈拉斯特利用他巨大的力量，从其他存在的星球上召唤生命，帮助他建造一座巫师塔，使所有其他巫师塔相形见绌。但随着季节的推移，七人组越来越少地看到他们神秘的主人。哈拉斯特继续利用来自遥远星球的堕落生物在他的塔下开凿隧道和进行其他建设，而且这位巫师对他的大部分地下交易的性质都对七人保密。最终，哈拉斯特的探索闯入了地下大厅，这是一个由矮人在沃特迪普山下的密特拉矿周围建造的隧道和房间群。地下城的设计者--梅莱尔金（Melairkyn）氏族，很早以前就被杀死或驱散了，交战的杜尔加人和乌鸦在废墟中定居。哈拉斯特开始了对乌鸦和duergar的讨伐，与星外盟友一起参与了穿越隧道的疯狂狩猎。顽固的杜尔加人一直挖到米塔尔石被基本开采出来；然后他们放弃了地下大厅，留下乌鸦独自与哈拉斯特和他的爪牙战斗。疯法师围捕了剩余的黑暗精灵，将他们中的一些灵魂困在他的黑暗魔法中，同时扭曲了其他人的身体，奴役了他们的思想。一旦他榨干了乌鸦的用处，{@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM}就继续挖隧道，一直往下挖，沉浸在他那莫名其妙的强迫症中，越挖越深的山。",
	"Using his underground complex as a base of operations, Halaster traveled to other planes and distant lands, collecting strange and dangerous creatures to live as prisoners, servants, or guardians in Undermountain. Populating and defending the dungeon became an obsession. Over time, the mage's preoccupation with Undermountain electrified his eccentricities and infused him with an air of unconcealable madness.": "哈拉斯特利用他的地下建筑群作为行动基地，前往其他星球和遥远的地方，收集奇怪和危险的生物，作为囚犯、仆人或地下山的守护者生活。填充和保卫地牢成为一种痴迷。随着时间的推移，法师对地下山的专注使他的怪癖变得更加强烈，并给他注入了一种难以掩饰的疯狂气息。",
	"Halaster's apprentices came and went. Some left only to return—inexplicably drawn down into Undermountain's depths. Others remained by his side. As they began dedicating more attention to their private obsessions, madness settled into their souls as well.": "哈拉斯特的学徒们来了又走。有些人离开后又回来了--莫名其妙地被卷入地下山的深处。其他人则留在了他身边。当他们开始将更多的注意力投入到他们的私人痴迷中时，疯狂也进入了他们的灵魂。",
	"During the years Halaster quested on other planes and sequestered himself in his tunnels, his magnificent tower and its surrounding walls fell into ruin. In time, the city now known as Waterdeep developed in the shadow of Mount Waterdeep and spread down to the harbor. As the city sprawled outward over the years, it came to surround the ruins of Halaster's home. Undermountain was known to those early settlers, and they often sent criminals into its endless depths as punishment. So it was for many years, until an intrepid adventurer named Durnan delved into the labyrinth beneath the tower and returned alive, laden with riches and countless harrowing tales. Durnan used his new fortune to demolish the remnants of Halaster's tower and built an inn over the well he had used to descend into Undermountain, and call it the Yawning Portal. Durnan owns and operates the inn and tavern to this day, serving patrons and inviting the brave and foolish alike to test their mettle in the Dungeon of the Mad Mage.": "在哈拉斯特在其他星球上探险和把自己关在隧道里的这些年里，他那座宏伟的塔和周围的墙壁都变成了废墟。随着时间的推移，现在被称为沃特德普的城市在沃特德普山的阴影下发展起来，并延伸到港口。随着城市多年来向外扩张，它开始围绕着哈拉斯特的家园废墟。早期的定居者们都知道山下，他们经常把罪犯送入无尽的深渊作为惩罚。就这样过了很多年，直到一个叫杜南的无畏的冒险家深入塔下的迷宫，并活着回来，带着财富和无数令人痛苦的故事。杜南用他的新财富拆除了哈拉斯特塔的残骸，并在他下到地下山的那口井上建造了一家旅馆，并将其称为 \"打哈欠的门户\"。杜南至今拥有并经营着这家客栈和酒馆，为顾客提供服务，并邀请勇敢的人和愚蠢的人在疯狂法师的地下城中测试他们的能力。",
	"Where Waterdeep stands today, there once stood Aelinthaldaar, the capital city of the ancient elven kingdom of Illefarn. When the elves left, they used a powerful spell to erase all traces of their capital. This spell had the unintended side effect of creating a permanent knot in the Weave, the fabric through which all magic is channeled. This knot lies deep underground and isn't something that can be seen, felt, or undone, but it can cause madness to bloom in the minds of mortal beings who dwell near it for too long. The knot permeates Undermountain, and the madness it causes typically manifests as an obsession with the dungeon itself. Those affected by the knot in the Weave exhibit a subconscious desire to remain in or near the dungeon. Halaster and several of his apprentices fell prey to this obsession, as did many Melairkyn dwarves and Durnan, the proprietor of the Yawning Portal. Not all creatures that dwell in Undermountain succumb to its madness, and those who do aren't even aware that the dungeon has them in its clutches.": "在Waterdeep今天矗立的地方，曾经有Aelinthaldaar，古代精灵王国Illefarn的首都。当精灵们离开时，他们用一个强大的咒语抹去了他们首都的所有痕迹。这个咒语有一个意外的副作用，那就是在 \"编织 \"中创造了一个永久的结，所有的魔法都是通过这个结传导的。这个结位于地下深处，不是可以看到、感觉到或解开的东西，但它会导致在它附近居住太久的凡人的头脑中绽放出疯狂。这个结渗透到地下山，它所导致的疯狂通常表现为对地牢本身的迷恋。那些受编织之结影响的人，会在潜意识中表现出对留在地牢或靠近地牢的渴望。哈拉斯特和他的几个学徒都是这种痴迷的牺牲品，许多梅莱尔金矮人和打哈欠门户的主人杜南也是如此。并非所有居住在阴山的生物都会屈服于它的疯狂，而那些屈服于它的生物甚至不知道地牢已经把他们抓在手里。",
	"The Yawning Portal, a famous inn and tavern located near the eastern slope of Mount Waterdeep, derives its name from a 40-foot-diameter well that descends into the first level of Undermountain. Located in the center of the taproom, the well was once the outer shell of Halaster's mighty tower, which was demolished long ago. Its sheer walls are made of old mortared stones. Next to this gaping orifice hangs a winch with a simple rope-and-pulley mechanism that Durnan, the proprietor, uses to lower adventurers down the shaft and (sometimes) pull them up again. Durnan controls the winch himself and will transport only one adventurer at a time. The trip takes 10 rounds, down and up. The rope is stained with old blood and long enough to reach all the way to the floor of the dark room at the bottom of the 140-foot shaft ({@area level 1, area 1|035|x}).": "打哈欠的门，是位于沃特德普山东坡附近的一家著名的客栈和酒馆，其名字来自于一口直径40英尺的井，这口井下到了地下山的第一层。这口井位于酒馆的中央，曾经是哈拉斯特强大的塔楼的外壳，很久以前就被拆除了。它的峭壁是由古老的石块砌成的。在这个缺口的旁边，挂着一个绞盘，上面有一个简单的绳索和滑轮装置，老板杜南用它把冒险者从井里放下去，（有时）再把他们拉上来。杜南亲自控制绞盘，每次只运送一个冒险者。这趟旅程需要10个回合，向下和向上。绳子沾满了旧血，足够长，可以一直伸到140英尺井底的黑暗房间的地板上（{@area level 1, area 1|035|x}）。",
	"Durnan charges adventurers 1 gp each to descend into the well, whether they opt to use the rope or not. The return trip also costs a piece of gold, sent up in a bucket in advance. He also readily accepts coin from patrons who want to place grisly bets on adventurers who dare explore Undermountain, and their odds of returning alive. \"Five gold dragons says they're back before a tenday, minus the fighter, the wizard, and the cleric!\" is the flavor of commentary often heard amid gales of drunken laughter.": "无论冒险者是否选择使用绳索，杜南都会收取每人1金币的下井费。回程的费用也是一块金子，事先放在桶里送上去。他也很乐意接受那些想在敢于探索地下山的冒险者身上下赌注的顾客的钱币，以及他们活着回来的几率。\"五条金龙说他们会在一个工作日之前回来，其中不包括战士、巫师和牧师！\"这是在醉醺醺的笑声中经常听到的评论的味道。",
	"The walls of the well are crumbly but have abundant handholds and footholds. They can be scaled without climbing gear with a successful DC 15 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check. No check is needed to enter Undermountain by using the rope-and-pulley system.": "井壁很脆弱，但有丰富的手掌和脚掌。只要成功地进行DC15力量({@skill Athletics})检查，就可以在没有攀登装备的情况下攀登。使用绳索和滑轮系统进入山下时不需要检查。",
	"Adventurers who hang around the Yawning Portal often find work delving into Undermountain on the errands of others. The characters might have their own reasons for venturing into the Mad Mage's dungeon, but the adventure hooks described in this section can be used as further motivation. These hooks are divided into two categories: starting quests and future quests. Adventurers are under no obligation to accept or complete any of these quests, though the promised rewards are often substantial enough to be tempting.": "在打哈欠门附近游荡的冒险者经常会因为别人的差事而找到深入山下的工作。角色们可能有自己的理由进入疯狂法师的地牢，但本节所述的冒险钩子可以作为进一步的动机。这些钩子分为两类：起始任务和未来任务。冒险者没有义务接受或完成任何这些任务，尽管承诺的奖励往往足够诱人。",
	"Starting quests are available to characters from the outset of their experience with Undermountain. Any of the quest givers described below might approach the characters shortly after their arrival at the Yawning Portal. The characters can accept as many or as few starting quests as they want. Based on the needs of your campaign, you might even introduce some starting quests of your own.": "角色们从一开始就可以在山下的体验中获得起始任务。下面描述的任何一个任务提供者都可能在角色到达哈欠门后不久接近他们。角色可以根据自己的意愿接受更多或更少的起始任务。根据你活动的需要，你甚至可以引入一些你自己的起始任务。",

	"Obaya approaches the adventurers and offers to pay for any unwanted magic items they find in Undermountain.

The amount she's willing to pay is based on the item's rarity, as shown in the Magic Item Rewards table, and is nonnegotiable. Characters would be hard-pressed to find anyone willing to spend as much for these items as Obaya is, and she always pays in platinum pieces for ease of transport.": "欧巴雅走近冒险者，表示愿意为他们在山下找到的任何不需要的魔法物品付费。欧巴雅在沃特达维亚的银行里有自己的资金，可以在几个小时内为人物带给她的任何魔法物品支付丰厚的报酬。她愿意支付的金额是基于物品的稀有程度，如魔法物品奖励表所示，而且没有商量余地。角色们很难找到像奥巴亚这样愿意为这些物品花这么多钱的人，而且为了方便运输，她总是用铂金碎片支付。",

Although the Rosznar family is trying to regain its integrity and standing, several bad apples threaten to impede that progress with their sinister ventures. Esvele's brother, Kressando, was sent to Skullport to conduct secret meetings with the Xanathar Guild and gauge interest in setting up a slave trade in Skullport, far from the eyes of Waterdavian authorities.

	"If the characters find the throne (see {@area level 3, area 14c|1d9|x}) and inform Volo of its location, he shares this information with his elf friends, who express their gratitude by giving the party a beautifully crafted longbow and an elven quiver containing twenty silvered arrows. The bow bears the Elvish inscription \"{@i Al hond ebrath, uol tath shantar en tath lalala ol hond ebrath}.\" This phrase translates to \"A true friend, as the trees and the water are true friends.\" The elves eventually embark on their own expedition into Undermountain, with the goal of retrieving the throne.": "如果角色们找到了王座（见{@area level 3, area 14c|1d9|x}）并告知沃罗它的位置，他就会与他的精灵朋友们分享这一信息，而精灵朋友们为了表达他们的感激之情，就会送给他们一把制作精美的长弓和一个装有20支银色箭矢的精灵箭筒。弓上有精灵语的铭文\"（%1%）\"。这句话被翻译成 \"一个真正的朋友，就像树木和水是真正的朋友\"。精灵们最终踏上了自己的征程，进入地下山，目的是为了夺回王位。",

	"Joroth approaches the characters in plain clothes and asks them to keep their eyes open for Falkir's Fist, a band of four dwarf adventurers that disappeared in Undermountain over a year ago. The leader of the band, Falkir Gravelfist, is believed to have stolen a famous emerald called the Eye of the Spider from the Mirabarran embassy in Waterdeep weeks prior to his disappearance. Joroth believes Falkir is dead (divination spells have confirmed as much) but would like to see the gemstone returned to its proper owners to strengthen political ties between Waterdeep and Mirabar.": "乔罗斯穿着便装走近人物，要求他们留意法尔基尔之拳，这是一个由四个矮人冒险者组成的队伍，一年多前在地下山失踪了。这支队伍的首领法尔基尔-格雷夫里斯特（Falkir Gravelfist）被认为在失踪前几周从水底世界的米拉巴兰大使馆偷了一块著名的绿宝石--蜘蛛之眼。乔罗斯相信法尔基尔已经死了（占卜法术已经证实了这一点），但他希望看到宝石物归原主，以加强沃特德普和米拉巴的政治联系。",

He says the gemstone is a spherical emerald roughly three inches in diameter, with a small imperfection in its core shaped vaguely like a spider. The gemstone has no magical properties as far as he knows. Joroth offers the friendship of the Lords' Alliance as a reward, which can be useful if one or more of the characters find themselves in need of assistance in Waterdeep or another alliance city. (For more information on the Lords' Alliance and its role in Waterdeep, see {@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH}.)": "乔罗描述法尔基尔是一个特别粗壮的矮人，戴着野猪头形状的头盔。他说宝石是一个球形的祖母绿，直径大约有三英寸，核心有一个小瑕疵，形状隐约像一只蜘蛛。据他所知，这块宝石没有任何魔法特性。乔罗斯提供了领主联盟的友谊作为奖励，如果一个或多个角色发现自己在沃特迪普或其他联盟城市需要帮助，这可能会很有用。(关于领主联盟及其在沃特德普的作用的更多信息，请参见（%0%）。",

If the characters negotiate for more than Jalester's goodwill, they're also promised a {@item luck blade} with no wishes remaining. Jalester neglects to mention, however, that this weapon belongs to Mirt the Moneylender, one of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep. Mirt himself delivers the {@item luck blade} once the Runestone fragment is in Laeral's hands, but looks rather put out at the thought of parting with it. \"Perhaps you might trade it back for dinner at my mansion?\" he asks the characters politely. Allowing Mirt to keep his sword puts the Masked Lord in the characters' debt—a fine prize indeed for their efforts.": "他没有提到向他提供符文石碎片的金钱奖励；相反，Jalester向人物提供了他持久的友谊--考虑到他在城市守望的地位，这可以带来很多好处。如果人物在谈判中得到了比Jalester的善意更多的东西，他们也会被许诺一个（%0%），没有剩余的愿望。然而，贾利斯特忽略了一点，这把武器属于放债人米特，他是水底世界的假面领主之一。一旦符文石碎片到了拉伊尔手中，米特就会亲自送上(1%)，但一想到要和它分开，他就显得很不高兴。\"也许你可以用它来换取在我宅邸的晚餐？\"他礼貌地问道。允许穆特保留他的剑，让面具人领主欠下了人物的债--这的确是对他们努力的最好奖励。",

It's Lady Wylynd's recollection that a longtime ally of the Moonstar family, a bronze dragon named {@creature Glyster|WDMM}, was asked or told to find Vanrak and bring him back to Waterdeep to face justice. The dragon found Vanrak but could not wrest him from the depths of Undermountain. Instead, the dragon became corrupted by Shar's magic and was transformed into a shadow dragon named {@creature Umbraxakar|WDMM}.

Word of these telepathic intrusions has begun to spread throughout the city, gaining traction as more than just a mad rumor. Several of Durnan's regular patrons have spoken at length about it, and Durnan believes the source might be somewhere in Undermountain.

She fled, but Halaster dragged her back to Undermountain and trapped her in the Citadel of the Bloody Hand, a dungeon complex under Mount Waterdeep connected to Undermountain. Jhesiyra escaped her prison when its wards failed during the Spellplague. To hide from Halaster, she magically confined herself in the stones of Undermountain. She now exists in a bodiless state, inhabiting the very dungeon itself. Halaster is unaware of Jhesiyra's presence but also wonders over her disappearance following the Spellplague.": "地下城最伟大的秘密之一是杰西拉-凯斯泰尔哈普（Jhesiyra Kestellharp）的故事。她是哈拉斯特最有天赋的学徒之一，直到她清楚地知道哈拉斯特已经不可逆转地疯了。她逃走了，但哈拉斯特把她拖回了地下山，并把她困在了血手堡垒，这是水底山下与地下山相连的一个地牢建筑。在法术瘟疫期间，当监狱的防护装置失效时，杰西拉逃出了监狱。为了躲避哈拉斯特，她用魔法将自己限制在地下山的石头里。她现在以无躯体的状态存在，居住在地牢本身。哈拉斯特不知道杰西拉的存在，但也对她在法术之灾后的失踪感到疑惑。",
	"Jhesiyra's plan is to use adventurers to defeat Halaster so that she can seize control of Undermountain. To that end, she does everything in her power to keep adventurers in Undermountain alive. Her abilities are, however, limited in her current, bodiless form.": "杰西拉的计划是利用冒险者来打败哈拉斯特，这样她就可以夺取地下山的控制权。为了达到这个目的，她不惜一切代价让地下城的冒险者活着。然而，她的能力在她目前的无躯体状态下是有限的。",
	"Jhesiyra can exert control over Halaster's magic gates, keeping adventurers from passing through them if she thinks they lack the might needed to defeat the perils beyond. In terms of game rules, characters are prevented from passing through a gate when their experience level fails to meet a prerequisite (the recommended character level for which the dungeon level is designed). Any character who doesn't qualify is pushed back without being harmed when trying to step through the open gate. Only a {@spell wish} spell can allow a character to pass through. As the Dungeon Master, you can suspend this restriction and allow characters who don't meet the level prerequisite to pass through a gate, particularly if you think they have the resources to survive and overcome that dangers that await them.": "Jhesiyra可以对Halaster的魔法门进行控制，如果她认为冒险者缺乏击败门外危险所需的力量，就不让他们通过。就游戏规则而言，当角色的经验值不符合先决条件（地牢等级设计时推荐的角色等级）时，他们就无法通过大门。任何不符合条件的角色在试图跨过打开的大门时都会被推后而不受到伤害。只有{@spell wish}的法术才能让角色通过。作为地下城主，你可以暂停这一限制，允许不符合等级先决条件的角色通过大门，特别是如果你认为他们有足够的资源来生存并克服等待他们的危险。",
	"Jhesiyra can't stop characters from moving between dungeon levels by more conventional means.

These restrictions apply to magic items and artifacts that have properties that transport or banish creatures to other planes as well. Magic that allows transit to the Border Ethereal, such as the {@spell etherealness} spell, is the exception to this rule.

The room contains the following features:": "一扇暗门打开，露出一个10英尺见方的空隔间，一条5英尺宽的粗凿石隧道从这里通出去。隧道略微下降，直到到达一个闻起来像下水道的房间。这个房间里有以下特征。",

	"{@b Statue}. A wide alcove in the north wall contains a life-size statue of a sahuagin, submerged up to its chest in sewer water. The statue emits a dim purple radiance, its head is completely turned around, and one of its arms has broken off and is nowhere to be seen.": "{@b Statue}. 北墙有一个宽阔的凹槽，里面有一尊真人大小的萨瓦金雕像，被淹没在下水道的水中，直到胸部。雕像散发着暗淡的紫色光芒，它的头完全转过来了，它的一只手臂已经断掉，不知所踪了。",

The statue's arm broke off long ago and rests now against the west wall, concealed beneath the dark water.": "萨瓦金雕像周围的紫色光环是无害的，对雕像施放{@spell dispel magic}可以消除它。雕像的手臂很久以前就断了，现在靠着西墙，隐藏在黑水之下。",
	"The statue's head is hollow, with holes for eyes and a larger hole for its fanged mouth. Further inspection reveals that the head has screw threads and is removable. Previous adventurers managed to unscrew it halfway before being scared off by the gray ooze. Unscrewing and removing the head exposes a hidden, charred compartment in the statue's neck. The compartment contains melted wax from candles that were used to illuminate the statue's head like a jack-o'-lantern.": "雕像的头部是空心的，有眼睛的孔和一个较大的孔，是它的獠牙嘴。进一步检查发现，头部有螺纹，是可以拆卸的。以前的冒险者在被灰色渗出物吓跑之前，设法把它拧了一半。拧开并取下头部后，雕像的脖子上露出一个隐藏的、烧焦的隔间。这个隔间里有融化的蜡，这些蜡是用来照亮雕像的头部的，就像一个千斤顶。",
	"The water seeps through cracks in the ceiling of the alcove, drips down the walls, and accumulates in the west end of the room before slowly leaking out through smaller cracks in the floor. The water is tepid, and not fit for drinking unless a {@spell purify food and drink} spell is cast on it.": "水从凹室天花板的裂缝中渗出，顺着墙壁滴下，在房间的西端积聚，然后慢慢地从地板的小裂缝中漏出。水是温热的，不适合饮用，除非对它施以（%0%）的法术。",

It has two eye-holes bored into it at a height of 5 feet, allowing a creature to peer into {@area area 2a|03b|x} beyond.": "{@b Secret Door}. 从这边可以看到一扇通往南方的暗门（不需要检查能力）。它在5英尺的高度上有两个眼孔，可以让一个生物窥视到（1%）以外的地方。",
	"The longsword is easy to remove from the armor stand, requiring no ability check. A {@spell detect magic} spell reveals that the sword is magical. It sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius. It also carries a curse that prevents its wielder from dropping it. If the blade is pried from its wielder's grasp, it instantly teleports back into the wielder's hand. The curse can be ended by casting a {@spell remove curse} spell or using similar magic on the sword's wielder, or by chopping off the hand that holds the weapon. The skeletal hand on the floor belonged to the orc who last held the sword.": "长剑很容易从盔甲架上取下，不需要检查能力。一个{@spell detect magic}的法术显示，这把剑是有魔力的。它在10英尺的范围内发出昏暗的光。它还带有一个诅咒，可以防止持剑者丢掉它。如果剑被从持剑者手中撬开，它就会立刻传送回持剑者的手中。诅咒可以通过对持剑者施展{@spell remove curse}的法术或使用类似的魔法来结束，或者通过砍掉持剑者的手来结束。地板上的骷髅手属于最后持有这把剑的兽人。",
	"Vent shafts in the ceiling connect to shop cellars in the city above. These passages carry voices from Waterdeep, but the sound is distorted so badly that words at one end can't be discerned by creatures at the other end. If the grills that cover the vent shafts are pried loose, a Tiny or gaseous creature could crawl through a shaft to escape Undermountain.": "天花板上的通风井连接到上面城市的商店地窖。这些通道传递着来自沃特迪普的声音，但声音被严重扭曲，一端的文字无法被另一端的生物辨别出来。如果覆盖通风井的栅栏被撬开，一个微小的或气态的生物就可以爬过通风井，逃离冥山。",
	"At the end of a long hall is a 50-foot-square room with five pillars made of mortared humanoid bones, painted black.

	"The deep alcoves and black pillars provide cover for the grells. As the characters move into the room, they can spot one or both grells by succeeding on a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check contested by the monsters' Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks. The grells are hungry and eagerly pursue fleeing prey. They have no treasure.": "深邃的凹槽和黑色的柱子为格莱尔人提供了掩护。当人物进入房间时，他们可以通过智慧（（%0%））检查和怪物的灵巧（（%1%））检查的成功来发现一只或两只蝼蛄。格雷尔人很饿，热衷于追赶逃亡的猎物。它们没有财宝。",
	"Several members of the Undertakers gang dwell here in their vampire disguises. If the {@creature bandit} keeping an eye on {@area area 1|035|x} through the secret door retreats here with news of the adventurers' arrival, add that individual to the forces arrayed here (one {@creature bandit captain}, six {@creature Bandit||bandits}, and two {@creature Doppelganger||doppelgangers}).

	"A {@spell detect magic} spell reveals the faintest, lingering trace of magic within both fragments of the staff. The staff can be repaired with a {@spell mending} cantrip. The first time the intact staff is held, it wails, \"Help! Thief! Criminal!\" before its magic fades forever. If the wailing occurs here, the creatures in {@area areas 6b|04b|x} and {@area 6c|04c} hear the noise and come to investigate.": "一个{@spell detect magic}的咒语揭示了法杖的两块碎片中最微弱的、挥之不去的魔法痕迹。这根法杖可以用{@spell mending}的咒语来修复。第一次拿起完整的法杖时，它会哀嚎：\"救命! 盗贼! 罪犯！\"然后它的魔力就永远消失了。如果哀号发生在这里，{@area areas 6b|04b|x}和{@area 6c|04c}的生物会听到声音并前来调查。",

	"A character who inspects the stone fresco and succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check discovers that one of the tiny dwarf figures is the top of a stone key slotted into a cavity that hides its teeth.

She reminds the adventurers that the Legion of Azrok has never once threatened Waterdeep—but the drow or the guild might leap at the chance to do just that.": "进入斯特罗姆库赫达尔西部（{@area area 21|205|x}）的冒险者会被带到阿兹罗克和鲁尔卡娜（{@area area 21n|21b|x}）面前，这是一种礼仪。在阿兹罗克保证他们在其定居点的安全后，鲁尔卡娜把他们带到一边，为安全归还她丈夫的魔法匕首提供奖励。她强调，如果没有这把匕首，入侵的乌鸦和Xanathar公会可能会征服斯特罗姆库赫杜尔并变得无比强大。她提醒冒险者，阿兹罗克军团从未威胁过水底世界，但乌鸦或公会可能会抓住机会这样做。",
	"Lurkana knows that the thieves who stole the dagger are duergar of Clan Ironeye, and she thinks they might be hiding in Skullport. (Characters who make discreet inquiries in Skullport can learn that a large contingent of duergar from Clan Ironeye resupplied in Skullport and drank ale at a local tavern called the Black Tankard before heading deeper into Undermountain. The tavern's tight-lipped duergar proprietor, Droon Stonedark, denies everything. The characters can catch up to the duergar of Clan Ironeye on level 6.)": "卢卡娜知道偷匕首的小偷是铁眼氏族的duergar，她认为他们可能躲在斯库尔波特。(在斯库尔波特谨慎询问的角色可以了解到，铁眼部族的一大批duergar在斯库尔波特进行了补给，并在当地一家名为 \"黑坦克 \"的酒馆喝了点啤酒，然后就深入到了地下山脉。酒馆老板Droon Stonedark对一切都讳莫如深，他否认了。人物可以在6级时追上铁眼氏族的duergar)。",
	"If the characters accept her quest, Lurkana suggests they search Skullport first and points them in the right direction (beyond {@area area 23|22b|x}). She also suggests that they speak with Skullport's ambassador to Stromkuhldur (the mind flayer in {@area area 21g|211|x}) to see if it knows anything. She cautions them not to harm the ambassador in any way, so as not to fray relations any further.": "如果人物接受了她的任务，卢卡娜建议他们先搜索斯库尔波特，并为他们指出正确的方向（超越（%0%））。她还建议他们与斯库尔波特的大使（Stromkuhldur）（位于{@area area 21g|211|x}中的心灵猎手）交谈，看看它是否知道什么。她告诫他们不要以任何方式伤害大使，以免进一步破坏关系。",
	"In exchange for the dagger, Lurkana is prepared to pay 1,000 gp delivered in a locked chest along with the key. If the characters demand more, she is willing to increase the payment to 1,500 gp and throw in two bugbears and five goblins as bodyguards and scouts. Unknown to Lurkana, two of the goblins have intellect devourers in their skulls and act as secret spies for Xanathar. The bugbears and other goblins serve the adventurers well, but being evil and greedy, they become increasingly difficult to control over time.": "作为对匕首的交换，卢卡娜准备支付1000金币，连同钥匙一起放在一个上锁的箱子里。如果角色们要求更多，她愿意将报酬提高到1,500金币，并加入两个虫人和五个地精作为保镖和侦察兵。卢卡纳不知道，其中两只地精的头骨里有智力吞噬者，并作为Xanathar的秘密间谍行事。虫熊和其他地精很好地服务于冒险者，但由于邪恶和贪婪，它们随着时间的推移变得越来越难以控制。",

	"Adventurers brought before Azrok are expected to offer tribute. He is more interested in oaths of fealty than in tangible gifts, but he accepts whatever he's offered.

If the characters want to retrieve the ring to complete a quest (see \"Search for {@area Kressando Rosznar|00d|x}\"), they'll have to kill Azrok, charm him into relinquishing it, or steal it while he's {@condition incapacitated}. The warlord does not give it up otherwise.": "阿兹罗克对这个提议很感兴趣，但发现克雷桑多居高临下。他杀死了这个贵族，因为他没有表现出应有的尊重。克雷桑多被开膛破肚的尸体被喂给了{@area area 17e|1ec|x}的奥特尤格，但阿兹罗克保留了手指作为战利品。如果人物想取回戒指来完成任务（见 \"寻找（%%1%）\"），他们必须杀死阿兹洛克，迷惑他放弃戒指，或者在他（%%2%）的时候偷走它。否则军阀是不会放弃它的。",
	"If the characters are looking for a safe place to rest and are on good terms with Azrok, Lurkana orders one of the goblins to escort them to {@area area 21i|214|x} or {@area 21l|217}.

	"The sound of screaming goblin children issues from small cracks in the walls of this building. Inside, two {@creature Goblin Boss||goblin bosses} are minding twenty goblin children (noncombatants).

	"Standing in front of the door to this chamber is a tired {@creature goblin} named Salt Nose, so named because he has white freckles on his broad snout.

	"Lurkana uses the banner as a form of punishment; she makes disobedient or incompetent underlings stand outside these quarters for hours or even days on end with no food, no water, and only the banner to keep them company. Salt Nose spilled a plate of food on Azrok's lap and fears that he will spend what little remains of his life here. Characters who take pity on him earn his trust, and he readily tells them where to find things in Azrok's Hold.

	"Wyllowwood is designed for four 8th-level characters. Those who defeat the monsters on this level should gain enough XP to reach 9th level. In some cases, defeating a monster can be accomplished without slaying it. If the characters strike a truce with a creature, award them XP as if they had defeated it in combat.": "Wyllowwood是为4个8级的角色设计的。在这一层打败怪物的人应该获得足够的XP值来达到第九层。在某些情况下，击败一个怪物可以不杀它。如果人物与怪物达成了休战协议，就像他们在战斗中击败了怪物一样给予他们XP。",
	"The characters will most likely arrive here by way of the River of the Depths, which they first encounter on level 4. Characters who follow the river must navigate rapids and small waterfalls to reach Wyllowwood.

	"In addition to dark caverns, this level contains forests of trees like those that grow on the surface.

Birds, insects, and tree-dwelling mammals live here alongside Wyllowwood's fiercer denizens.": "除了黑暗的洞穴之外，这一层还包含了像生长在地表的树木的森林。这些温带森林是由哈拉斯特用魔法创造的，高高在上的天空会让冒险者以为他们已经逃离了地下山，找到了回到地面的方法。鸟类、昆虫和住在树上的哺乳动物与怀洛伍德的凶猛居民一起生活在这里。",
	"The forests are real and nourished by magic, and Halaster regularly repopulates them with birds, insects, rodents, and larger mammals. The main caverns have 100-foot-high ceilings hidden by illusions that can't be dispelled. These illusions begin 30 feet above ground and create the impression of open sky where high walls and ceilings should be. The illusions flawlessly duplicate the sun, the moon, the stars, and clouds, though there is no wind or breeze to speak of. During the day, the warmth of the sun can be felt, and at night the temperature drops as one would expect. Despite appearances, the walls and ceilings are still very much in place, and a {@spell true seeing} spell or similar magic reveals them.": "这些森林是真实的，由魔法滋养，哈拉斯特定期用鸟类、昆虫、啮齿动物和较大的哺乳动物重新填充它们。主要洞穴有100英尺高的天花板，被无法驱散的幻觉所掩盖。这些幻象从离地面30英尺开始，在本应是高墙和天花板的地方创造出开阔天空的印象。这些幻象完美地复制了太阳、月亮、星星和云朵，尽管没有风或微风可言。白天，可以感受到太阳的温暖，而到了晚上，温度就会像人们所期望的那样下降。尽管表面上看，墙壁和天花板仍然很完好，一个{@spell true seeing}的咒语或类似的魔法就能揭示它们。",
	"A magic calendar stone in {@area area 6k|2d0|x} allows one to change the time of day, the weather, and the season in Wyllowwood's forests. {@creature Wyllow|WDMM} the archdruid (see \"What Dwells Here?\" below) is the only one permitted to use the calendar stone.

	"Undermountain is {@creature Wyllow|WDMM}'s home now, and all memory of the surface world has faded from her mind. She is distant but kind toward those who pass harmlessly through her domain, but turns violent whenever her forest or its peaceful denizens are threatened.

She can also summon six awakened trees from the forest with a whistle.": "山下现在是{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}的家，所有关于地面世界的记忆已经从她的脑海中消失了。她对那些无害地通过她的领地的人很疏远，但却在她的森林或其和平居民受到威胁时变得很暴力。在出发消灭入侵者之前，她会召集绿龙和狼人，用它们来软化她的对手。她还可以用口哨从森林中召唤出六棵被唤醒的树木。",
	"{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}'s displacer beast companion, Crissann, is named after a human mercenary whom the elf befriended many years ago.

	"{@creature Wyllow|WDMM} has conflicted feelings about Halaster. She is grateful to him for providing her a home and keeping Wyllowwood alive with his magic, but she blames him for Yinark's death.

Thus, she has given up any hope of being rid of him.": "{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}对哈拉斯特的感情很矛盾。她很感激他为她提供了一个家，并以他的魔法使怀洛伍德得以生存，但她又为尹纳克的死责怪他。她也很同情他，因为这个疯狂的法师似乎也被困在了他自己制造的监狱里。{@creature Wyllow|WDMM}认为他不再是人类，而是一个由纯魔法组成的不朽实体。因此，她已经放弃了摆脱他的任何希望。",

	"The village and its environs stood empty for years until a congregation of goblin werebats took residence in the caves around the buildings.

	"If a creature that is reduced to one-twelfth its normal size falls from the castle, it will travel over 600 relative feet before hitting the cavern floor due to the reducing effect around the castle, which turns every foot of actual distance into 12 feet of relative distance.

Because the reducing effect creates more relative distance between the creature and the cavern floor, a fall from anywhere on the castle deals {@dice 20d6} bludgeoning damage on impact.": "如果一个被缩小到正常大小的十二分之一的生物从城堡上掉下来，由于城堡周围的缩小效应，它在落到洞穴地面之前会走过600多英尺的相对距离，这使得每英尺的实际距离变成12英尺的相对距离。从它的角度来看，这个生物似乎要坠落几百英尺，然后在撞击前的最后40英尺内突然变大12倍。由于缩小效应在生物和洞穴地板之间创造了更多的相对距离，从城堡的任何地方坠落都会造成{@dice 20d6}撞击伤害。",
	"Halaster constructed this castle to serve as a temporary residence for guests, then abandoned it when he decided he didn't really want the company.

Instead of the normal effect, all creatures inside the chamber must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, taking 44 ({@dice 8d10}) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. You can replace this damaging effect with a more benign one.

When the time comes to conquer Waterdeep, the Mad Mage plans to use Mecha-Halaster to destroy the city's walking statues. Without its head and the immense magic needed to power it, the iron construct is nothing more than a giant boondoggle. In its current state, it is considered an inanimate object, not a creature. Medium or smaller creatures that squeeze inside it can use the outer shell and inner mechanisms as cover.

A githyanki astral ship doesn't travel through space but rather shifts in and out of the Astral Plane, appearing literally out of nowhere next to the asteroid's dock and disappearing back into the silvery void once its delivery is complete.

	"Deep in the Underdark, a githyanki vanguard force attacked a large colony of mind flayers controlled by an elder brain. Fearing the colony's destruction, the elder brain instructed its most loyal vassal, an ulitharid called Extremiton, to establish a splinter colony somewhere safe from githyanki incursions. Extremiton made its way to Undermountain with a group of mind flayers, laid claim to level 17 of the dungeon, and began fortifying it against attacks from the githyanki and others. The dungeon's proximity to Waterdeep guaranteed the mind flayers a limitless supply of brains to feed on, while Undermountain's existing defenses offered an unprecedented level of security.": "在暗黑世界的深处，一支githyanki的先锋部队袭击了一个由长老大脑控制的大型心灵传播者殖民地。由于担心殖民地被摧毁，长老大脑指示它最忠诚的附庸，一个叫Extremiton的乌利塔利人，在一个安全的地方建立一个分裂的殖民地，以避免吉特汉克的入侵。埃斯特里米顿带着一群精神分裂者来到了地下山，占据了地下城的第17层，并开始加固它以抵御来自吉特汉克和其他国家的攻击。地牢离水底世界很近，这就保证了噬心者有无穷无尽的大脑可供吸食，而地下山现有的防御系统则提供了前所未有的安全保障。",
	"Through methods unknown to the illithids, the githyanki vanguard force tracked the survivors of their attack on the colony to Undermountain. Having recently secured the nearby Crystal Labyrinth ({@adventure level 16|WDMM|16}), the githyanki now wage war against the mind flayers in Seadeeps. Uncertainty about its own future has forced Extremiton to hold off on transforming into an elder brain. Instead, it is focused on defending the colony and destroying its githyanki neighbors. With only a dozen mind flayers remaining under its rule, Extremiton has resorted to breeding a neothelid (see {@adventure appendix A|WDMM|25}) and plans to set it loose in the Crystal Labyrinth to finally wipe out the githyanki force. Extremiton is also gathering thralls of every race to help defend the colony if the neothelid is destroyed or fails in its task.": "通过illithids不知道的方法，githyanki的先锋部队追踪他们攻击殖民地的幸存者到了Undermountain。在最近获得了附近的水晶迷宫({@adventure level 16|WDMM|16})之后，githyanki现在开始对Seadeeps的思想传播者发动战争。对自己未来的不确定感迫使艾斯米顿暂缓转变为长老级的大脑。相反，它专注于保卫殖民地和摧毁它的邻居吉特汉基。在它的统治下，只剩下十几个心灵传播者，Extremiton已经求助于繁殖一个neothelid（见{@adventure appendix A|WDMM|25}），并计划把它放进水晶迷宫，最终消灭githyanki的力量。埃斯特里米顿还在收集各个种族的傀儡，以便在新海怪被摧毁或任务失败时帮助保卫殖民地。",
	"Extremiton can sense intelligent creatures within 2 miles of it and is able to communicate with them telepathically.

	"In the heart of Seadeeps, the ulitharid has built an enormous dynamo that channels the energy of an underground river to power a series of interconnected metal capsules called psipods. The illithids under Extremiton's command have kidnapped humanoids from Waterdeep and Undermountain and put them to sleep in these capsules, which link their dreaming minds to the ulitharid's dizzying intellect. These captives believe they're in Waterdeep, but the city they see and experience around them is a fabrication created wholly by the ulitharid.

	"Mounted on both sides of every door in the mind flayer colony ({@area areas 9|8c4|x} through {@area 20|8f0}) is a burnished plate of dark, alien metal embossed with a braille-like form of tactile writing known as Qualith. Mind flayers use their tentacles to read Qualith, which is composed in four-line stanzas indecipherable to other creatures. A creature that touches a Qualith inscription, however, can receive fragmentary insight into the multilayered thoughts contained in it. A non-illithid that wants to understand a Qualith inscription in Seadeeps can make a DC 18 Intelligence check to interpret the inscription. A failed attempt results in a crushing headache and requires the creature to succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or develop a random form of short-term madness (see \"{@book Madness|DMG|8|Madness}\" in chapter 8 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}). A comprehend languages spell provides understanding of the inscription roughly equivalent to what a mind flayer would get from it.": "安装在掠夺者殖民地的每扇门的两侧（{@area areas 9|8c4|x}到{@area 20|8f0}）的是一块漆黑的外星金属板，上面压印着一种类似盲文的触觉文字，称为Qualith。噬心者用他们的触角来阅读Qualith，它是由四行诗句组成的，其他生物无法破译。然而，触摸到Qualith铭文的生物可以获得对其中所包含的多层次思想的零星洞察力。一个非illithid想要理解Seadeeps中的Qualith铭文，可以进行DC18智力测验来解释铭文。失败的结果是头痛欲裂，并要求该生物在DC11的智慧救赎中获得成功，或者发展出一种随机形式的短期疯狂（见《{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}》第8章中的\"{@book Madness|DMG|8|Madness}\"）。一个理解语言的法术提供了对铭文的理解，大致上相当于一个思想骗子会从铭文中得到的东西。",

The Qualith inscription on the plate describes the genuflections a mind flayer must make with its tentacles to open the door. Other creatures with at least four tentacles (such as flumphs) can imitate these motions to bypass the lock, provided they can interpret the inscription. A creature must be within 5 feet of the door to open it in this way. Creatures without the requisite tentacles and knowledge must deal with the lock by more conventional means, such as a knock spell. If magic is unavailable, a locked door can be forced open with a successful DC 30 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check.": "每块门板都被灌注了幻觉能量，其功能就像一个奥术锁咒语。门板上的Qualith铭文描述了噬心者必须用其触手做出的屈膝动作才能打开门。其他拥有至少四条触手的生物（比如弗伦普斯）可以模仿这些动作来绕过锁，只要它们能够解释铭文。一个生物必须在门的5英尺范围内才能用这种方式打开它。没有必要的触手和知识的生物必须通过更常规的手段来处理锁，比如敲击法术。如果无法使用魔法，可以通过成功的DC30力量（（%0%））检查来强行打开一扇锁住的门。",

	"Alterdeep looks, sounds, smells, and feels like Waterdeep. Prolonged exposure to this alternate world, however, increases the possibility of detecting a flaw that betrays its true nature. Although Extremiton has created an impressive facsimile, characters who are drawn into the environment notice slight discrepancies in the way familiar NPCs act, or pick up on minor details that the ulitharid has gotten wrong or can't reasonably duplicate: slight changes in decor, books that are blank between the covers, foul-tasting elven wine, dwarves unable to speak Dwarvish, and so on.": "阿尔特迪普的外观、声音、气味和感觉都与沃特迪普一样。然而，长期暴露在这个另类世界中，会增加发现暴露其真实性质的缺陷的可能性。尽管埃斯特里米顿创造了一个令人印象深刻的复制品，但被吸引到这个环境中的人物会注意到熟悉的NPC的行为方式有细微的差异，或者发现一些小细节，而这些小细节是乌利塔里德人弄错了或者无法合理复制的：装饰的轻微变化、封面之间空白的书、味道难闻的精灵酒、不能说矮人语的矮人，等等。",
	"As soon as a character encounters such a discrepancy, the ulitharid also becomes aware of it, since their minds are linked. When confronted with an error, Extremiton either takes steps to correct it or tries to draw attention away from it. For example, it doesn't know Dwarvish well enough to cause the residents of Alterdeep to speak it fluently, so it might subtly remove all known Dwarvish-speaking characters from the simulation until its familiarity with that language improves significantly.": "只要一个角色遇到这种差异，乌利塔里德也会意识到它，因为他们的思想是相通的。当面对一个错误时，Extremiton要么采取措施来纠正它，要么试图将注意力从它身上转移开。例如，它对矮人语的了解还不足以让阿尔特迪普的居民说流利的矮人语，所以它可能会巧妙地将所有已知的说矮人语的角色从模拟中移除，直到它对这种语言的熟悉程度明显提高。",
	"The most accurate and fleshed-out location in Alterdeep is the Yawning Portal. Extremiton is particularly fascinated with the establishment, its owner, and its clientele. Most newcomers to the simulation awaken here, and Extremiton tries to create enough situations of interest in the tavern to keep its captive audience engaged. Extremiton appears in the Yawning Portal as its gruff proprietor, Durnan, though it can inhabit other fake NPCs as well. The ulitharid has focused most of its attention on the Yawning Portal because that location sits atop the entrance to Undermountain and is a hotbed of humanoid interaction.": "在Alterdeep，最准确、最丰满的地点是 \"打哈欠的门\"。Extremiton对这个场所、它的主人和它的顾客特别着迷。大多数新来的人都是在这里觉醒的，Extremiton试图在酒馆中创造足够多的有趣的情况，以保持其俘虏的观众。灭绝师太在 \"打哈欠的门 \"中以粗鲁的老板杜南的身份出现，不过它也可以在其他假的NPC身上出现。这只乌利塔利德把大部分注意力集中在打哈欠的门上，因为这个地方位于地下山的入口处，是一个人形互动的温床。",
	"Creatures can be hurt, healed, and killed in the simulation just as they can be in the real world, and a character reduced to 0 hit points makes death saving throws as normal. Any creature that joins the simulation by entering a psipod and dies in the simulation also dies for real from the shock, as though it had taken enough psychic damage to instantly kill it. Creatures immune to psychic damage can't be killed by this kind of system shock and stabilize automatically inside the simulation.": "生物在模拟中可以被伤害、治疗和杀死，就像它们在现实世界中一样，而且一个角色的命中率降至0，可以像普通人一样进行死亡储蓄。任何通过进入psipod加入模拟的生物，如果在模拟中死亡，也会在真实世界中因震荡而死亡，就像它受到足够的精神伤害而立即死亡一样。对精神伤害免疫的生物不会被这种系统冲击杀死，并在模拟中自动稳定下来。",
	"If characters in the simulation try to escape Alterdeep's city limits, Extremiton creates situations to dissuade them: bad weather, a city-wide lockdown, a festival—whatever it takes. The ulitharid hasn't researched areas outlying the city. Consequently, nothing but thick fog lies beyond the city gates. The same is true for Alterdeep's version of Undermountain; characters who descend the well in the Yawning Portal taproom find themselves enshrouded in fog with nowhere to go but back up. Extremiton, in the guise of Durnan, discourages exploration of Undermountain by claiming that the Mad Mage has magically sealed it off. Characters who are brought into the simulation can escape only if Extremiton allows it or if their psipods are shut down. The ulitharid might remove one or more characters from the simulation if it finds them too disruptive, in which case they're taken out of their psipods and confined to area 10 until they can be fed to the neothelid in area 8. The characters can also try to form an alliance with the ulitharid. Extremiton might release them if, in exchange, they promise to destroy the githyanki that are threatening the mind flayer colony. You can roleplay these interactions or have the characters make ability checks to convince Extremiton to let them back into the real world.": "如果模拟中的人物试图逃离Alterdeep的城市范围，Extremiton会创造一些情况来劝阻他们：恶劣的天气、全城封锁、节日--不管是什么情况。ulitharid还没有研究过城市外围的地区。因此，城门外除了浓雾，什么都没有。阿尔特迪普的地下山也是如此；从 \"打哈欠的门 \"自来水房的井里下来的人物发现自己被雾气笼罩，除了往上走之外无处可去。杜南（Durnan）假扮的艾斯米顿（Extremiton）声称疯狂法师已经用魔法封住了地下山，因此不鼓励人们探索地下山。被带入模拟的角色只有在Extremiton允许或他们的psipods被关闭的情况下才能逃脱。如果Ulitharid发现一个或多个角色太具破坏性，它可能会将他们从模拟中移除，在这种情况下，他们会被从psipods中取出，并被限制在10区，直到他们可以被喂给8区的neothelid。这些角色也可以尝试与乌利塔里德人结成联盟。如果作为交换，Extremiton可能会释放他们，他们会承诺摧毁威胁到心灵火器殖民地的Githyanki。你可以在这些互动中扮演角色，或者让角色进行能力检查，以说服Extremiton让他们回到现实世界中。",

	"Adherents of Shar have been active in the shadow of Mount Waterdeep ever since a disastrous expedition to the Black Jungles mounted in the Year of the Dark Dawn (1104 DR) by Lord Vanrak Moonstar, a charismatic, outgoing swashbuckler. Vanrak was but a pale shadow of his former self when he returned. A few tendays later, his father, Lord Andvarran Moonstar, the family patriarch, died of a strange wasting disease that could not be cured by healing magic.": "自从黑暗黎明之年（1104 DR）范拉克-月星勋爵（Lord Vanrak Moonstar）对黑丛林进行了一次灾难性的远征后，沙尔的信徒们就一直活跃在水德普山的阴影下，他是一个富有魅力、外向的游侠。范拉克回来时，他只是一个苍白的影子。几天后，他的父亲，家族长老安德瓦兰-月星勋爵，死于一种奇怪的消耗性疾病，无法用治疗魔法治愈。",
	"Upon assuming leadership of House Moonstar, Vanrak publicly broke with the temple of Selûne (god of the moon), which he blamed for his father's untimely death. Consumed with bitterness, the Dark Ranger, as Vanrak came to be known, secretly embraced Selûne's sister: Shar, the Lady of Loss.": "在担任月星家族的领导后，凡瑞克公开与塞鲁恩神庙（月神）决裂，他把父亲的早逝归咎于塞鲁恩神庙。被痛苦吞噬的黑暗游侠，也就是凡瑞克，秘密地拥抱了塞鲁恩的妹妹。沙尔，损失的女人。",
	"By the Year of the Howling Moon (1130 DR), House Moonstar was in open schism. Family members who still venerated Selûne aligned themselves with Lord Vanrak's sister, Lady Alathene, and Selûne's priesthood. Meanwhile, Lord Vanrak and his followers extended their dark influence over much of the city's harbor with the aid of a small army of mercenaries bolstered by followers of Shar.": "到了嚎月之年（1130 DR），月星家族陷入了公开的分裂。仍然崇敬塞鲁恩的家族成员与凡拉克勋爵的妹妹阿拉泰恩夫人和塞鲁恩的神职结盟。与此同时，凡瑞克勋爵和他的追随者在沙尔的追随者的帮助下，将他们的黑暗势力扩展到城市的大部分港口。",
	"Lady Alathene appeared in open court and asked the Lords of Waterdeep to strip her brother of his title and banish him from the city. She also presented evidence of her brother's numerous crimes, including slavery, arson, theft, and murder. The Lords ordered the immediate capture of the Dark Ranger, but by the time the City Watch had breached the gates of his villa, Vanrak and his followers had already fled through a secret portal into Undermountain. He and his followers remained there until, in the Year of the Dark Mask (1171 DR), they conquered the level of Undermountain that came to be known as Vanrakdoom.": "阿拉泰恩女士在公开法庭上出庭，要求水底城的领主们剥夺她哥哥的头衔，并将他驱逐出城。她还提出了她哥哥的众多罪行的证据，包括奴役、纵火、偷窃和谋杀。领主们命令立即抓捕黑暗游侠，但当城市守望者攻破他的别墅大门时，凡拉克和他的追随者已经通过一个秘密入口逃到了地下山。他和他的追随者们一直呆在那里，直到黑暗面具年（1171 DR），他们征服了地下山的那一层，被称为凡拉克多姆。",
	"Operating from his new base, Vanrak extended his influence throughout much of Undermountain and even periodically dispatched elite strike teams to battle followers of Selûne in the city above. He achieved his most dramatic success in the Year of the Tomb (1182 DR), when his followers infiltrated the High House of Stars through its cellars, slaughtered most of the inhabitants before they could raise an alarm, engulfed the temple in black fire, and burned it to the ground. The invaders also acquired enough treasure from the temple vaults to fund Lord Vanrak's personal quest for immortality. Within a few years, the Dark Ranger had transformed himself into a death knight.": "范拉克从他的新基地出发，将他的影响力扩展到整个冥山的大部分地区，甚至定期派遣精英突击队与上面城市中的塞卢恩的追随者作战。他在古墓之年（1182 DR）取得了最戏剧性的成功，当时他的追随者通过地窖潜入高等星空之家，在居民发出警报之前就将他们中的大多数人杀死，用黑火吞噬了神庙，并将其烧为平地。入侵者还从神庙的金库中获得了足够的财宝，以资助凡拉克勋爵个人对不朽的追求。在几年内，黑暗游侠已经把自己变成了一个死亡骑士。",
	"The Lords of Waterdeep didn't make things easy for Vanrak Moonstar in the years that followed. They hired waves of adventurers to descend into Undermountain to bring Vanrak and his followers to justice. Although none of these adventurers succeeded, they winnowed down Vanrak's army to the point where he could no longer threaten the city.": "在随后的几年里，水底世界的领主们并没有让凡拉克-月星的事情变得简单。他们雇佣了一波又一波的冒险家进入冥山，将凡瑞克和他的追随者绳之以法。虽然这些冒险者都没有成功，但他们将凡瑞克的军队削弱到无法再威胁这座城市的程度。",
	"{@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM} compounded Vanrak's woes by urging other Undermountain dwellers to invade Vanrakdoom from time to time. In a desperate move, the few remaining priests of Shar performed rituals to harness the despair of Vanrak's shadow dragon mount, {@creature Umbraxakar|WDMM}, and use him to transport Vanrakdoom into the Shadowfell. In the end, Halaster's magical hold over Undermountain proved too strong to overcome, yet a small section of Vanrakdoom crossed over into the Plane of Shadow and became ensconced there.": "{@creature Halaster Blackcloak|WDMM}通过怂恿其他山下居民不时地入侵Vanrakdoom，使Vanrak的处境更加艰难。在一次绝望的行动中，仅存的几个沙尔牧师举行了仪式，利用凡拉克的影龙坐骑（%%1%）的绝望，并利用它将凡拉克多姆运送到阴影城。最后，哈拉斯特对暗山的魔法控制被证明太强大了，无法克服，但有一小部分凡拉克多姆穿越到了暗影界，并在那里安家落户。",
	"Confronted by failure, Vanrak came to believe that Shar had deceived him and had orchestrated his downfall solely to spite her nemesis, Selûne. Vanrak had lost his family, his title, and most of his army, and he was in danger of losing hold over his domain. In the Year of Silent Shadows (1436 DR), he renounced his faith in Shar and begged Selûne's forgiveness for the destruction of her temple and its followers. In a desperate act of redemption, the death knight destroyed his undead form using a {@item sun blade}. A vampire cleric of Shar named {@creature Keresta Delvingstone|WDMM} has ruled Vanrakdoom ever since.": "面对失败，Vanrak开始相信Shar欺骗了他，并策划了他的堕落，只是为了报复她的复仇者Selûne。凡瑞克失去了他的家人，他的头衔，以及他的大部分军队，他面临着失去对他的领地的危险。在沉默的阴影之年（1436 DR），他放弃了对沙尔的信仰，并乞求塞卢尼原谅他对她的神庙及其信徒的破坏。在一次绝望的救赎行动中，死亡骑士用一个{@item sun blade}摧毁了他的不死形态。从此，一个名叫{@creature Keresta Delvingstone|WDMM}的沙尔的吸血鬼教士统治了Vanrakdoom。",
	"With the shadow of Vanrak faded from memory, House Moonstar has prospered. The Waterdavian family is currently overseen by the once shrewd but now senile Lady Wylynd Moonstar, a venerable human noblewoman who, by last estimate, is well over a century old. Although she has no children of her own, Wylynd is surrounded by distant relatives, including a savvy half-drow grandnephew named Helion Moonstar, whom she has chosen to be her heir. The family's business interests lie in cartography and exploration, and Wylynd has been known to fund expeditions to Undermountain from time to time for reasons she prefers to keep to herself.": "随着凡拉克的阴影从记忆中消逝，月星家族已经繁荣起来了。沃特达维亚家族目前由曾经精明但现在已经衰老的怀琳德-月星女士监管，她是一位可敬的人类贵族，据最后估计，她的年龄已经远远超过一个世纪。虽然她没有自己的孩子，但Wylynd身边有很多远房亲戚，包括一个精明的混血儿孙子Helion Moonstar，她选择他作为自己的继承人。家族的商业利益在于制图和探索，而且据了解，由于她不愿透露的原因，Wylynd时常资助探险队前往地下山。",
	"This level is controlled by servants of Shar and creatures of shadow.": "这一层是由夏尔的仆人和阴影生物控制的。",
	"{@creature Keresta Delvingstone|WDMM} grew up in the streets of Waterdeep and is no stranger to hardship. Hoping to make a better life for herself, she became an adventurer and sought fame and fortune in Undermountain. Keresta met her end in the lair of a vampire and became a{@creature vampire spawn} under its command.": "{@creature Keresta Delvingstone|WDMM}在沃特德普的街道上长大，对艰难困苦并不陌生。她希望为自己创造更好的生活，于是成为一名冒险家，并在山下寻求名和利。凯斯塔在一个吸血鬼的巢穴中遇到了她的结局，并成为其手下的{@creature vampire spawn}。",
	"After Vanrak destroyed the vampire and conquered its lair, he took Keresta under his wing. Consumed by darkness and loss, Keresta was drawn to Shar like a moth to a flame and rose to become a vampire cleric of the evil god. She now leads Shar's debased cult in Vanrakdoom and intends to send the group on a mission to destroy the Spires of the Morning, the temple of Lathander (god of birth and renewal) in Waterdeep. She also has her sights set on destroying the House of the Moon—Waterdeep's temple of Selûne, whom she blames for the destruction of Vanrak Moonstar.": "在范拉克摧毁了吸血鬼并征服了它的巢穴之后，他把凯雷斯塔带到了他的羽翼之下。被黑暗和失落所吞噬，凯雷斯塔像飞蛾扑火一样被夏尔所吸引，并成为这位邪神的吸血鬼牧师。她现在在凡拉克多姆领导着夏尔的堕落邪教，并打算派人去摧毁瓦特德普的拉坦德神庙（Lathander）（出生和复兴之神）--\"晨曦之塔\"。她还将目光投向了摧毁水底世界的月神殿，她将凡拉克月星的毁灭归咎于塞鲁恩。",

	"Fog creeps into areas of dim light or darkness. It vanishes when light is brought to bear on it but reappears when the light passes. A permanent fog hangs in some areas regardless of light, as noted in the descriptions of those areas.": "雾悄悄地进入昏暗的光线或黑暗的区域。当光线照射到它时，它就会消失，但当光线过去时，它又会出现。在某些地区，无论光线如何，都会有永久的雾气存在，这一点在这些地区的描述中有所说明。",
	"Rats and bats are plentiful. In areas where they are not specifically mentioned, droppings and guano betray their presence, and they can be heard constantly scuttling and shrieking in the distant darkness.": "老鼠和蝙蝠的数量很多。在没有特别提到它们的地方，粪便和鸟粪出卖了它们的存在，而且可以听到它们在遥远的黑暗中不断窜动和尖叫。",
	"If Keresta is destroyed, the fog disperses, and the rats and bats gradually die off until only a scattered few remain.": "如果凯斯塔被摧毁，雾气就会散去，老鼠和蝙蝠会逐渐死亡，直到只剩下零星的几只。",
	"The shadow dragon {@creature Umbraxakar|WDMM} used to be a lawful good bronze dragon named {@creature Glyster|WDMM}. Fond of assuming human form, {@creature Glyster|WDMM} was Vanrak Moonstar's friend and companion, remaining by the noble's side even after Vanrak's fall from grace. {@creature Glyster|WDMM} tried to turn Vanrak away from the worship of Shar, to no avail, and the dragon sank into despair. In this forlorn state, he allowed Shar's priests to transform him into a shadow dragon to better serve Vanrak in the battles to come. Thereafter, {@creature Glyster|WDMM} became known as {@creature Umbraxakar|WDMM} (\"shadowborn\" in Draconic).": "影龙（%0%）曾经是一只名为（%1%）的合法善良的青铜龙。喜欢化身为人形，{@creature Glyster|WDMM}是凡瑞克-月星的朋友和伙伴，即使在凡瑞克堕落之后，他仍然留在贵族的身边。{@creature Glyster|WDMM}试图让凡瑞克脱离对沙尔的崇拜，但没有成功，龙陷入了绝望。在这种绝望的状态下，他允许沙尔的祭司将他改造成一条影子龙，以便在未来的战斗中更好地服务于凡拉克。此后，{@creature Glyster|WDMM}被称为{@creature Umbraxakar|WDMM}（Draconic中的 \"影子出生\"）。",
	"The death knight and the shadow dragon fought side by side for many years, expanding their domain and then defending it against adventurers and other invaders. By this time, {@creature Umbraxakar|WDMM} had stopped caring about anything except his friendship with Vanrak. The friendship finally ended when Vanrak destroyed himself with a {@item sun blade}, leaving {@creature Umbraxakar|WDMM} and the remnants of Shar's wicked cult to fend for themselves.": "死亡骑士和影龙并肩作战多年，扩大他们的领域，然后抵御冒险者和其他入侵者。到了这个时候，{@creature Umbraxakar|WDMM}已经不再关心任何事情了，除了他和凡瑞克的友谊。这段友谊最终在凡瑞克用{@item sun blade}毁灭自己时结束，留下{@creature Umbraxakar|WDMM}和沙尔邪恶邪教的残余分子自生自灭。",
	"As characters explore areas of Vanrakdoom, they experience magical visions of terrible things that the dragon experienced long ago. These visions, byproducts of {@creature Umbraxakar|WDMM}'s despair, provide clues that can help free the dragon from his dark curse. A character does not experience such visions within an antimagic field or while under the protection of a {@spell dispel evil and good} spell.": "当人物探索凡拉克多姆的区域时，他们会经历龙在很久以前经历的可怕事情的神奇幻觉。这些幻象是{@creature Umbraxakar|WDMM}绝望的副产品，提供了一些线索，可以帮助龙摆脱他的黑暗诅咒。在反魔法场内或在{@spell dispel evil and good}法术的保护下，角色不会经历这种幻觉。",
	"Characters also encounter magical projections of {@creature Umbraxakar|WDMM}. These shadowy images take the form of harmless, dragon-shaped clouds of black fog.

	"The cult of Shar in Vanrakdoom consists mainly of{@creature vampire spawn} under the command of {@creature Keresta Delvingstone|WDMM}. Living cultists also find their way here from time to time, guided through Undermountain by the dark grace of Shar herself. Keresta turns the most promising acolytes into vampire spawn. Those deemed unworthy of Shar's blessing nourish Keresta and her spawn with their blood, after which {@creature Umbraxakar|WDMM} devours the exsanguinated corpses.": "范拉克多姆的夏尔教派主要由{@creature vampire spawn}在{@creature Keresta Delvingstone|WDMM}的指挥下组成。活着的崇拜者也时常会找到这里，他们在夏尔本人的黑暗恩典指引下穿过地下山。凯斯塔将最有前途的崇拜者变成了吸血鬼的后代。那些被认为不值得Shar祝福的人用他们的血来滋养Keresta和她的卵子，之后{@creature Umbraxakar|WDMM}就会吞噬掉那些被榨干的尸体。",

	"{@area Areas 19|93c|x} through {@area 33|962} of Vanrakdoom are ensconced in the Shadowfell and remain there as long as {@creature Umbraxakar|WDMM} is alive. In these areas, bright light is reduced to dim light, and dim light to darkness. In addition, all color has been drained from these areas, and a deathly stench hangs in the air. The walls are severely cracked, the floor tiles are buckled and broken in numerous places, and the ceilings have begun to sag as though they won't remain in place much longer.": "梵克多姆的{@area Areas 19|93c|x}到{@area 33|962}都被安置在阴影地带，只要{@creature Umbraxakar|WDMM}还活着，就会留在那里。在这些地区，明亮的光线被削弱为昏暗的光线，而昏暗的光线则被削弱为黑暗。此外，所有的颜色都从这些地方被抽走，空气中弥漫着死亡的臭味。墙壁严重开裂，地砖倒扣，多处破损，天花板也开始下垂，仿佛不能再保持原状了。",
	"Areas within the Shadowfell are no longer part of Undermountain and therefore aren't subject to its magical restrictions (see \"{@area Alterations to Magic|018|x}\").": "阴影之城内的区域不再是暗影山的一部分，因此不受暗影山的魔法限制（见\"（%0%）\"）。",
	"The shadow dragon's despair can cause other areas of Vanrakdoom to slide in and out of the Shadowfell at irregular intervals—sometimes for a few seconds or minutes, sometimes for hours. Any such shift happens at your discretion and lasts as long as you want. When an area slides into the Shadowfell, all colors and lights within the area become muted as described above.": "影龙的绝望可以使凡拉克多姆的其他地区以不规则的间隔滑入和滑出阴影地带--有时是几秒钟或几分钟，有时是几个小时。任何这样的转变都是由你决定的，持续的时间也是你想要的。当一个区域滑入阴影地带时，该区域内的所有颜色和光线都会变暗，如上所述。",

Three sisters named Arandraya, Maelweene, and Yarlithra Shadowdusk became famous for sponsoring and then leading adventuring expeditions into Undermountain. One of the items they recovered from the dungeon was a tablet of black crystal that allowed contact with entities of the Far Realm. Their brother, Xerrion, came to possess the tablet and used it to contact otherworldly beings in an attempt to destroy his family's business rivals and political enemies. This contact drove Xerrion mad, and it didn't take long for the madness to spread to other members of the Shadowdusk family and come into public view. As the family's behavior grew more bizarre, local broadsheets circulated rumors that the Shadowdusks had been replaced by aberrant horrors in human guise. Their ancestral villa, Shadowdusk Hold, was burned to the ground in the Year of the Harp (1355 DR).

	"All three of Xerrion's sisters were killed in the fire that consumed Shadowdusk Hold. Xerrion escaped and fled to his sisters' redoubt in the depths of Undermountain.

The heads speak only the languages they knew in life and have no recollection of how they ended up in their disembodied state. A character can prompt a head for information, which it's happy to provide.

Whether Jhesiyra remains disembodied or assumes a corporeal form when she usurps Halaster's control over Undermountain is also for you to decide, but one thing she won't do is reactivate Halaster's gates. She doesn't trust them and would prefer to create her own gates in due time.

Unaware of Jhesiyra's attempt to dethrone him, Halaster re-forms in Undermountain as he has done many times before. He doesn't take being killed personally, but it inspires him to toughen Undermountain's defenses so that the next group of adventurers can't thwart him so easily. Much of his time in the coming months is spent creating a new demiplane and a new tower to replace the ones that were destroyed after he died.": "如果杰西拉无法夺取冥山的控制权，她就会继续以失魂落魄的姿态潜伏在地牢中，等待另一个出现的机会。由于不知道杰西拉试图推翻他的统治，哈拉斯特像以前多次那样在地下山重新形成。他对自己被杀并不以为然，但这也激励着他加强地下山的防御，使下一批冒险者不能轻易挫败他。在接下来的几个月里，他的大部分时间都花在创建一个新的半位面和一个新的塔，以取代他死后被摧毁的那些。",

Where the locks end is a vast cavern containing a smooth stone retaining wall that rises 10 feet above the water's surface. The partially collapsed remnants of a ten-story-tall hoist loom above the retaining wall. This contraption was designed to lift a vessel of almost any size, swing it over the wall, and lower it down the other side to the River Sargauth 100 feet below. Skullport lies just a few hundred yards farther along the underground river. Time and neglect have rendered the hoist nonfunctional, thus preventing large ships from reaching the Port of Shadow. Many denizens of Skullport would like to fix it, but they lack the mutual trust and cooperation required for such a project to succeed. The absence of the hoist hasn't stopped all manner of nefarious sorts from using their own ropes to haul rowboats and other small craft over the barrier wall.": "随着人们向山的深处行进，水变得越来越平静，那里有一系列的魔法锁控制着水位。船只在它们之间经过时，会下降数百英尺。锁的尽头是一个巨大的洞穴，里面有一堵光滑的石头挡墙，高出水面10英尺。一座十层楼高的升降机的部分坍塌的残余物在挡土墙上晃动。这个装置被设计用来举起几乎任何大小的船只，将其摆过墙面，并将其从另一侧降到100英尺以下的萨尔高斯河。斯库尔波特就在沿地下河的几百码远处。随着时间的推移和疏忽，这个升降机已经无法使用了，因此大型船只无法到达阴影港。斯库尔波特的许多居民都想修复它，但他们缺乏这样一个项目成功所需的相互信任和合作。起重机的缺失并没有阻止各种邪恶的人用他们自己的绳索将划艇和其他小型船只拖过隔离墙。",

If given contradictory commands from two different ring wearers, a scaladar immediately shuts down and becomes {@condition incapacitated} for 1 hour. {@creature Trobriand|WDMM} has a master ring that lets him override the commands of other ring wearers without causing a scaladar to shut down. {@creature Trobriand|WDMM}'s rings function only in Undermountain.": "{@creature Trobriand|WDMM}制作的魔法环来控制标度。每个戒指都是一个黑色的金属环，上面有一个刺状突起。没有任何鳞甲虫可以伤害佩戴这种戒指的人，任何在戒指佩戴者100英尺范围内的鳞甲虫都必须服从它的口令。戒指的魔力使黄鼠狼能够理解和解释这些命令，尽管这些生物没有自己的语言。如果从两个不同的戒指佩戴者那里得到相互矛盾的命令，标枪会立即关闭，并在1小时内变成（%1%）。{@creature Trobriand|WDMM}有一个主戒指，可以让他推翻其他戒指佩戴者的命令，而不会导致标枪的关闭。{@creature Trobriand|WDMM}的戒指只在山下发挥作用。",
	"A scaladar doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "标度盘不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"A {@creature shadow assassin|wdmm} looks like an undead {@creature shadow} (as described in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}) that wields shortswords also made of shadow. It exists only to slay the living.": "一个{@creature shadow assassin|wdmm}看起来像亡灵{@creature shadow}（如{@book Monster Manual|MM}所述），挥舞着同样由影子制成的短剑。它的存在只是为了杀戮活人。",
	"A shadow assassin doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.": "影子刺客不需要空气、食物、饮料或睡眠。",
	"Very rarely, an illithid tadpole transforms an individual into an {@creature ulitharid|VGM} rather than an ordinary mind flayer. Ulitharids are larger than mind flayers and have six tentacles instead of four. Illithids innately recognize that an ulitharid's survival is more important than their own. In most colonies, an ulitharid becomes an elder brain's most favored servant, invested with power and authority. In others, the elder brain perceives the ulitharid as a potential rival, manipulating or quashing the ulitharid's ambitions accordingly.": "很少有这样的情况，一个illithid蝌蚪会把一个人变成一个（%0%），而不是一个普通的心灵传播者。Ulitharids比mind flayers更大，有六个触角而不是四个。伊利特人天生就认识到，一个乌利特人的生存比他们自己的生存更重要。在大多数殖民地，ulitharid成为长老大脑最宠爱的仆人，被赋予权力和权威。在其他情况下，长老会认为ulitharid是一个潜在的竞争对手，并相应地操纵或平息ulitharid的野心。",
	"When an ulitharid finds sharing leadership with an elder brain to be insufferable, it breaks off from the colony, taking a group of mind flayers with it, and forms a new colony. After the death of the ulitharid's body, mind flayers place its brain in a brine pool, where it grows into an elder brain over a few days.": "当ulitharid发现与一个长老的大脑分享领导权是难以忍受的，它就会从群体中脱离出来，带着一群思想传播者，形成一个新的群体。在乌利塔里德的身体死亡后，思想传播者将其大脑放在盐水池中，几天后它就会成长为一个长老大脑。",
	"Each ulitharid carries a psionically enhanced staff made of black metal. When the ulitharid is ready to give up its body, it attaches the staff to the back of its head and uses the staff to crack open its own skull and peel it apart, enabling its brain to be extracted and placed in a brine pool, where it can grow into an elder brain. The staff serves no other purpose.": "每个ulitharid都带着一根由黑色金属制成的幻觉强化法杖。当ulitharid准备放弃它的身体时，它把法杖固定在它的后脑勺上，用法杖敲开自己的头骨，把它剥开，使它的大脑被提取出来，放在一个盐水池里，在那里它可以成长为一个长者的大脑。该法杖没有其他用途。",
	"A {@creature werebat|WDMM} is a humanoid afflicted with a rare form of lycanthropy that enables it to transform into a giant bat or a bat-humanoid hybrid. (See the {@book Monster Manual|MM} for more information on lycanthropy.) Most werebats are of {@creature goblin} stock.": "一个{@creature werebat|WDMM}是被一种罕见的狼人症折磨的人形生物，使其能够转变为一只巨大的蝙蝠或蝙蝠-人形混合体。(参见{@book Monster Manual|MM}了解更多关于狼人的信息。) 大多数狼人都是{@creature goblin}的成员。",
	"Werebats are shunned even by {@creature goblin} society because of their need to feed on blood to survive. They prefer to lair in dark places, such as attics and caves, and typically adopt nocturnal hunting habits.": "狼人甚至被(%%)社会所回避，因为它们需要以血为食来生存。它们喜欢在黑暗的地方筑巢，如阁楼和洞穴，并且通常采取夜间狩猎的习惯。",
	"A werebat must consume at least 1 pint of fresh blood each night, or it weakens and gains one level of {@condition exhaustion} that no amount of rest alone can remove. Each pint of blood the werebat consumes removes one level of {@condition exhaustion} gained in this fashion.": "狼人每晚必须消耗至少1品脱的新鲜血液，否则它就会变弱并获得一个等级的{@condition exhaustion}，单靠休息是无法消除的。狼人每消耗一品脱的血液，就会消除以这种方式获得的1%的等级。",
	"A player character who becomes a werebat gains a Dexterity of 17 if their score isn't already higher. Attack and damage rolls for the werebat's bite attack are based on the character's Strength or Dexterity score, whichever is higher.": "变成狼人的玩家角色会获得17的灵巧，如果他们的分数还没有高的话。狼人咬人的攻击和伤害卷是基于角色的力量或灵巧得分，以较高者为准。"
