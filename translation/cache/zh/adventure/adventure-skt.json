	"You are about to embark on a great adventure that pits heroes against giants bent on reshaping the world. {@i Storm King's Thunder} is a Dungeons & Dragons adventure for four to six player characters. You can start the adventure with 1st-level characters or 5th-level characters. Either way, the characters should reach at least 11th level by the adventure's conclusion. Because giants figure prominently in the story, at least one character should be able to speak and understand the Giant language.": "你即将踏上一场伟大的冒险，让英雄们对抗一心想要重塑世界的巨人。{@i Storm King's Thunder}是一个龙与地下城的冒险，适合四到六个玩家角色。你可以用1级的角色或5级的角色开始冒险。无论哪种方式，角色在冒险结束时都应该达到至少11级。因为巨人在故事中占有重要地位，所以至少有一个角色应该能够说并理解巨人的语言。",
	"The adventure takes place in the Forgotten Realms, specifically in a region known as the Savage Frontier, in the northwest corner of the continent of Faerûn. Nonetheless, you can easily adapt the adventure to your home campaign by changing the names of various locations and factions.": "这场冒险发生在被遗忘的领域，特别是在法鲁恩大陆西北角的一个被称为野蛮人边境的地区。尽管如此，你可以通过改变不同地点和派别的名称，轻松地将这个冒险改编为你的家庭活动。",

	"The Savage Frontier (also known as the North) is a cold, rugged, sparsely populated land of snow-capped mountains, rocky hills, sprawling forests, and foggy vales. Isolated strongholds, ancient burial mounds, and the ruins of many forgotten empires dot this vast landscape. Bounded by the Sea of Swords to the west and the desert of Anauroch to the east, the Savage Frontier extends as far north as Icewind Dale and as far south as the town of Daggerford. Old roads stretch across this great expanse, linking the dwarven strongholds and mines in the mountains to the coastal settlements, frontier towns, and fortified outposts of humans and other folk. These roads are long, lonely, or poorly defended, making them dangerous to traverse. In fertile valleys, towns and cities have sprung up, separated by dozens if not hundreds of miles of untamed wilderness haunted by bandits, barbarians, and monsters.": "野蛮人边境（又称北方）是一片寒冷、崎岖、人烟稀少的土地，由雪山、岩石山、无垠的森林和多雾的山谷组成。孤立的堡垒、古老的坟冢和许多被遗忘的帝国的废墟点缀着这片广阔的土地。西边是剑海，东边是阿诺罗奇沙漠，野蛮人边境向北延伸到冰风谷，向南延伸到达格福特镇。古老的道路在这片广阔的土地上延伸，将山区的矮人据点和矿场与沿海的定居点、边境城镇以及人类和其他民族的坚固前哨连接起来。这些道路漫长、孤独，或者防守不力，使得它们在穿越时很危险。在肥沃的山谷中，城镇和城市如雨后春笋般涌现，它们之间隔着几十甚至几百英里的未开垦的荒野，那里有强盗、野蛮人和怪物出没。",
	"Evil dragons stirred into action by their dark queen, Tiamat, threatened the settlements of the Savage Frontier for a time. Ultimately, they were defeated and forced to withdraw to their lairs, while Tiamat was banished to the Nine Hells. Fear of the dragons' wrath has faded quickly with the coming of a new threat: giants. The peoples of the North are no strangers to giant incursions. Frost giants have long claimed the Spine of the World as their demesne, and hill giants are known to scrounge for food in the untamed hills. But now, in the past couple of months, giants of every kind have emerged from their strongholds in force to threaten civilization as never before—and not just frost giants and hill giants, but also stone giants, fire giants, and cloud giants. All of the giants are in an uproar. Reports of giant attacks throughout the North have reached the coastal cities of Luskan, Neverwinter, and Waterdeep, stoking fears that the giants are waging war against humans, dwarves, elves, and other small folk.": "被它们的黑暗女王提亚马特煽动起来的邪恶巨龙，曾一度威胁到野蛮边境的定居点。最终，它们被打败并被迫撤回它们的巢穴，而提亚马特被放逐到九层地狱。随着新威胁的到来，对龙的愤怒的恐惧迅速消退：巨人。北方的人民对巨人的入侵并不陌生。长期以来，冰霜巨人一直声称世界之脊是他们的领地，而山丘巨人也被称为在未被驯服的山丘上觅食。但现在，在过去的几个月里，各种类型的巨人都从他们的据点里出来，以前所未有的方式威胁着人类文明--不仅仅是冰霜巨人和山丘巨人，还有石巨人、火巨人和云巨人。所有的巨人都在骚动。关于整个北方的巨人攻击的报告已经传到了卢斯坎、永夜和水底的沿海城市，激起了人们对巨人正在对人类、矮人、精灵和其他小民发动战争的担忧。",
	"Giant society (such as it is) is defined in large part by the ordning, a caste system imposed upon the giants by their gods, chief among them Annam the All-Father. The ordning determines where a giant stands among his or her ilk. Traditionally, storm giants have stood at the top of the ordning. Tall and powerful, they struggle to keep the weaker races of giants from despoiling the realms of small folk and sparking conflict. The greatest storm giants are powerful seers, skilled at identifying and interpreting cosmic signs and divine omens. The aloof and aristocratic cloud giants, one step below the storm giants, rarely condescend to deal with lesser giants or small folk. Extravagance defines their culture and their place in the ordning. Below them are the tyrannical, warmongering fire giants and the merciless, predatory frost giants. Fire giants rank themselves by their forging skill, whereas frost giants rank themselves by their martial prowess. Near the bottom of the ordning are the xenophobic stone giants, who mostly live underground and regard the surface world as a realm of dreams. How well they sculpt stone determines their place among their peers. The lowest and smallest of the true giants are the hill giants, as gluttonous as they are loathsome. Hill giants are dullards who live in fear of their more powerful giant cousins. In hill giant society, the biggest rule.": "巨人社会（比如说）在很大程度上是由秩序决定的，这是一个由他们的神明强加给巨人的种姓制度，其中最主要的是全能之父安南。等级制度决定了一个巨人在他或她的同族中的地位。传统上，风暴巨人一直站在阶级的顶端。他们高大而强大，努力阻止弱小的巨人种族掠夺小民的领域并引发冲突。最伟大的风暴巨人是强大的预言家，善于识别和解释宇宙的迹象和神圣的预兆。冷漠而贵族化的云巨人，比风暴巨人低一级，很少屈尊与低等巨人或小民打交道。奢侈的生活决定了他们的文化和他们在军团中的地位。在他们之下是暴虐的、好战的火巨人和无情的、掠夺性的冰霜巨人。火巨人以他们的锻造技术为标准，而冰霜巨人则以他们的武艺为标准。靠近底层的是排外的石巨人，他们大多生活在地下，把地面世界看作是一个梦境。他们对石头的雕琢程度决定了他们在同龄人中的地位。真正的巨人中最低级和最小的是山丘巨人，他们既贪吃又令人厌恶。山地巨人是呆子，他们生活在对他们更强大的巨人表亲的恐惧之中。在山地巨人社会中，最大的统治者。",
	"Dragons are the ancient enemies of giants. Thousands of years ago, the last great empire of giants—Ostoria—fell after a long and brutal conflict with dragons. Little of Ostoria remains in what is now called the Savage Frontier. The civilizations of small folk have taken over the land once ruled by giants. Although evil giants make occasional forays into territory settled by small folk, their ambitions have long been curtailed by their lack of cohesion and the imposition of good-aligned storm giants and cloud giants whose memories of ancient, glorious Ostoria have faded over time.": "龙是巨人的古老敌人。几千年前，巨人的最后一个大帝国--奥斯托利亚--在与龙的漫长而残酷的冲突后灭亡。在现在被称为 \"野蛮人边境 \"的地方，奥斯托里亚的遗迹很少。小民的文明已经占领了曾经被巨人统治的土地。虽然邪恶的巨人偶尔会闯入小民定居的领土，但他们的野心早已被他们缺乏凝聚力和善意的风暴巨人和云层巨人的强加限制了，他们对古代辉煌的奥斯托利亚的记忆已经随着时间的推移而淡化。",
	"The recent efforts by dragons to bring Tiamat into the world (as told in the adventures {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen} and {@i The Rise of Tiamat}) and the attempts by small folk to thwart them so upset the giant gods that Annam the All-Father shattered the ordning between the giants to break his \"children\" out of their complacency, pitting the six giant types against one another while keeping some semblance of order within each type. In so doing, Annam has spurred cloud, fire, frost, stone, and hill giants to challenge the established hierarchy and reforge their destiny. All the giants sensed the upheaval instantly, and now the giant types fiercely compete against one another, striving to create a new ordning through their deeds and accomplishments. These giants' calamitous endeavors have not only put the settlements of humans and other small folk in jeopardy but also attracted the attention of the giants' ancient enemies—the dragons—who will not abide the rise of another giant empire.": "最近，龙为将提亚马特带入世界所做的努力（如冒险故事{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}和{@i The Rise of Tiamat}中所述），以及小人物为挫败他们所做的尝试，使巨神们非常不满，全能之父安纳姆打破了巨人们之间的秩序，使他的 \"孩子们 \"不再自满，让六种类型的巨人互相对立，同时保持每种类型中某种秩序的样子。这样一来，安南就刺激了云、火、霜、石和山丘巨人去挑战既定的等级制度，重新塑造他们的命运。所有的巨人都立刻感觉到了这种动荡，现在各类型的巨人都在激烈地相互竞争，力争通过他们的行为和成就创造一个新的秩序。这些巨人的灾难性努力不仅使人类和其他小民的定居点处于危险之中，而且还吸引了巨人的古老敌人--龙的注意，它们不会容忍另一个巨人帝国的崛起。",
	"Small folk can only speculate as to the cause of the giants' unrest. It remains to be seen whether the old ordning between the giant types will be restored, or whether a new hierarchy will replace the old one, knocking the storm giants from their lofty perch.": "小民们只能猜测巨人动荡的原因。巨人类型之间的旧秩序是否会恢复，或者新的等级制度是否会取代旧的等级制度，将风暴巨人从其崇高的位置上打下来，我们拭目以待。",
	"Prior to the shattering of the ordning, {@creature King Hekaton|SKT} was arguably the most powerful of all storm giants. From Maelstrom, his citadel deep within the Trackless Sea, he presided over a court that included representatives of every race of giant, from mighty storm giants to lowly hill giants. He used the power of the {@item Wyrmskull Throne|SKT}—a gift given to him by his wife—to keep the more unruly giants in line.": "在秩序破碎之前，（%0%）可以说是所有风暴巨人中最强大的。在无轨海深处的堡垒--漩涡中，他主持着一个包括各族巨人代表的法庭，从强大的风暴巨人到卑微的山丘巨人。他使用{@item Wyrmskull Throne|SKT}的力量--他妻子给他的礼物--来使更多不守规矩的巨人保持一致。",
	"For as long as Hekaton had reigned, fear of the king's wrath and respect for the ordning was enough to keep lesser giants from rising up against him. But in recent years, {@creature King Hekaton|SKT} had become convinced that the age of the giants was past, as evidenced by the growing distance between the giants and their gods. Annam the All-Father didn't answer prayers, and his divine offspring—the lesser giant gods—were out of touch, constantly waging war against one another on the Outer Planes. Hekaton came to believe that the giants were no longer the rightful masters of the world.": "在赫卡顿统治的这么长时间里，对国王的愤怒的恐惧和对法令的尊重足以让较小的巨人不起来反抗他。但近年来，{@creature King Hekaton|SKT}已经确信，巨人的时代已经过去了，巨人和他们的神之间的距离越来越远就是证明。全能之父安南（Annam the All-Father）不回应祈祷，他的神性后代--较小的巨神--失去了联系，不断地在外层星球上相互发动战争。赫卡顿开始相信，巨人不再是世界的合法主人了。",
	"Then, several months ago, Hekaton's fear became reality when the ordning was shattered. The king was profoundly shaken by the realization that storm giants might lose their apex status among giants. In the aftermath of the upheaval, he did his utmost to hold his court together, bullying weaker giants into submission.": "然后，几个月前，当法令被打破时，赫卡顿的恐惧成为现实。国王意识到风暴巨人可能会失去他们在巨人中的最高地位，因而受到了深深的震撼。在动荡之后，他尽最大努力来维持他的宫廷，欺负弱小的巨人，使他们屈服。",
	"Hekaton's wife, Queen Neri, was particularly fond of the small folk. She visited them often in the years before the ordning was sundered, rising up out of the sea to meet them on the shores of the Sword Coast. Neri continually urged her husband to respect the civilizations of the small folk and leave them alone, if he could not countenance forming alliances with them. Hekaton, inherently distrustful of the small folk, wanted nothing to do with them, but he respected his wife's desire to treat with them on occasion.": "赫卡顿的妻子，奈里女王，特别喜欢这些小民。在法令被废除之前的几年里，她经常拜访他们，从海中升起，在剑海岸边与他们会面。内里不断敦促她的丈夫尊重小民的文明，不要打扰他们，如果他不能忍受与他们结成联盟。赫卡顿本来就不信任小民，不想和他们有任何瓜葛，但他尊重他妻子的愿望，偶尔和他们交往。",
	"Neri continued to visit the small folk from time to time even after the upheaval—until the day came when she failed to return from one of her trips to the Sword Coast. Hekaton's younger brother, {@creature Imperator Uthor|SKT}, commander of the king's garrison, found Neri's corpse shortly thereafter on a small island where she had been known to meet with humans. It was clear that she had been killed by small folk, and Hekaton wept for days before threatening to unleash his vengeance on the unsuspecting coastal territories.": "即使在动乱之后，奈瑞仍然不时地拜访小民，直到有一天，她在一次去剑海岸的旅行中没有回来。赫卡顿的弟弟（%0%），国王的驻军指挥官，不久后在一个小岛上发现了奈瑞的尸体，据说她曾在那里与人类会面。很明显，她是被小民所杀，赫卡顿哭了好几天，然后威胁说要向毫无戒心的沿海地区展开复仇。",
	"Uthor couldn't calm his brother's rage, so he turned to Princess {@creature Serissa|SKT}, the king's youngest daughter, for help. {@creature Serissa|SKT}, who shared her mother's affection for small folk and who stood next in line to inherit the {@item Wyrmskull Throne|SKT}, urged her father to uncover the truth before lashing out at anyone he encountered. Hekaton was swayed by his daughter's levelheadedness and wisdom, and once his hurricane-like anger ran its course, he set out to learn how his wife met her end. Unfortunately for the king, he was blind to enemies not only in his court but also in his family.": "乌瑟尔无法平息他哥哥的怒火，于是他向国王的小女儿（%0%）公主寻求帮助。{@creature Serissa|SKT}和她母亲一样喜欢小市民，而且她是下一个继承{@item Wyrmskull Throne|SKT}的人，她敦促她的父亲在对遇到的任何人大发雷霆之前先找出真相。希卡顿被他女儿的冷静和智慧所动摇，一旦他的飓风般的愤怒过后，他就开始了解他的妻子是怎么死的。对国王来说，不幸的是，他不仅对宫廷中的敌人视而不见，而且对他的家人也是如此。",
	"The seeds of discontent in Hekaton's family were sown more than a year before the ordning was shattered, when the king divined that his two eldest daughters, {@creature Mirran|SKT} and {@creature Nym|SKT}, were unfit to rule, and saw signs that pointed to {@creature Serissa|SKT}, his youngest daughter, as his most worthy successor. {@creature Mirran|SKT} was tempestuous and prone to emotional outbursts, while {@creature Nym|SKT} was the opposite—as cold and unloving as the sea. While Hekaton adored them both, he doubted their ability to keep the lesser giants in line, so he named {@creature Serissa|SKT} as his heir apparent.": "希卡顿家族不满的种子在法令被打破的一年多前就已经播下了，当时国王预感到他的两个长女{@creature Mirran|SKT}和{@creature Nym|SKT}不适合统治，并看到有迹象表明，他的小女儿{@creature Serissa|SKT}是他最值得的继承人。{@creature Mirran|SKT}脾气暴躁，容易情绪失控，而{@creature Nym|SKT}则相反，像大海一样冷酷无情。虽然海卡顿很喜欢他们两个，但他怀疑他们是否有能力让较小的巨人保持一致，所以他指定（%5%）为他的继承人。",
	"{@creature Mirran|SKT} and {@creature Nym|SKT} abided by his decision, but nevertheless their unhappiness was clear. Secretly, they blamed their mother for persuading their father to pass them over. Their blame was unfounded, in fact; Queen Neri had actually warned her husband against making any such pronouncement. {@creature Mirran|SKT} and {@creature Nym|SKT} seethed inside but were too terrified of their father to do anything, until a recent arrival to Maelstrom named {@creature Iymrith|SKT} wormed her way into Hekaton's court and goaded them into action.": "{@creature Mirran|SKT}和{@creature Nym|SKT}遵守了他的决定，但尽管如此，他们的不快乐是显而易见的。他们暗地里责怪他们的母亲劝说他们的父亲放弃他们。事实上，他们的责备是毫无根据的；内里王后实际上已经警告过她的丈夫不要做出任何这样的宣告。{@creature Mirran|SKT}和{@creature Nym|SKT}内心愤怒，但对他们的父亲太害怕了，什么都不敢做，直到最近一个叫{@creature Iymrith|SKT}的人来到漩涡镇，蠕动着进入赫卡顿的宫廷，促使他们行动起来。",
	"The elder sisters, acting in accordance with {@creature Iymrith|SKT}'s counsel, are responsible for both Neri's death and Hekaton's disappearance. {@creature Mirran|SKT} and {@creature Nym|SKT} got their revenge against Neri by plotting—with {@creature Iymrith|SKT}'s help—to have her assassinated. Then they urged their father to hunt down the small folk who killed their mother and fed him false information on the whereabouts of the assassins, to throw the king off track and put him in peril.": "大姐们按照{@creature Iymrith|SKT}的建议行事，对奈里的死和赫卡顿的失踪都负有责任。{@creature Mirran|SKT}和{@creature Nym|SKT}通过谋划--在{@creature Iymrith|SKT}的帮助下--暗杀了奈里，为她报了仇。然后，他们怂恿他们的父亲追捕杀害他们母亲的小人物，并向他提供关于刺客下落的虚假信息，以使国王偏离轨道，使他处于危险之中。",
	"In the wake of Hekaton's disappearance, turmoil engulfed his court. After nearly a month of waiting for him to come back, {@creature Serissa|SKT} reluctantly claimed her father's throne at {@creature Imperator Uthor|SKT}'s urging.": "在赫卡顿失踪后，他的宫廷陷入了动荡之中。在等待他回来的近一个月后，{@creature Serissa|SKT}在{@creature Imperator Uthor|SKT}的催促下，不情愿地认领了她父亲的王位。",
	"{@creature King Hekaton|SKT}'s eldest daughter, {@creature Mirran|SKT}, is a spoiled brat with the forcefulness and unpredictability of a typhoon. She covets the power of the {@item Wyrmskull Throne|SKT} and believes it rightfully belongs to her. She is angry with her parents for placing {@creature Serissa|SKT} next in the line of succession, and she has made her feelings plain. {@creature Mirran|SKT} believes she is destined to rule and has seen signs that reinforce her belief. Once she claims the throne, {@creature Mirran|SKT} expects all other giants to kneel before her. She plans to use her newfound power to resurrect the ancient empire of Ostoria, sweeping away the cities and kingdoms of the small folk.": "{@creature King Hekaton|SKT}的长女{@creature Mirran|SKT}是个被宠坏的孩子，有着台风般的强势和不可预测。她觊觎{@item Wyrmskull Throne|SKT}的权力，认为它理应属于她。她对父母将{@creature Serissa|SKT}安排在继承人行列中感到愤怒，她已经把自己的感受说得很清楚。{@creature Mirran|SKT}认为她注定要统治，并看到了加强其信念的迹象。一旦她登上王位，{@creature Mirran|SKT}希望所有其他巨人都能在她面前下跪。她计划用她新发现的力量来复活古老的奥斯托利亚帝国，扫除小民的城市和王国。",
	"If {@creature Mirran|SKT} is the blustery gale of an ocean storm, then {@creature Nym|SKT} is the undercurrent. {@creature King Hekaton|SKT}'s middle child is cold and calculating. She has always felt neglected by her parents, in part because {@creature Mirran|SKT} was so demanding and {@creature Serissa|SKT} so young. In truth, {@creature King Hekaton|SKT} and Queen Neri loved {@creature Nym|SKT} as much as they adored their other daughters, but they found her distant and difficult to please. {@creature Nym|SKT} wants {@creature Mirran|SKT} to seize the throne—and then, when {@creature Mirran|SKT} makes enemies at every turn and proves to everyone that she is unfit to rule, {@creature Nym|SKT} plans to supplant her. She has received omens that support her bid for power. Unlike her blustery older sister, {@creature Nym|SKT} is worried about the consequences of the dissolution of the ordning. Nonetheless, {@creature Iymrith|SKT} has convinced her that she has an important destiny to fulfill, and that the gods will reward her if she brings about the return of Ostoria.": "如果{@creature Mirran|SKT}是海洋风暴的狂风，那么{@creature Nym|SKT}就是暗流。{@creature King Hekaton|SKT}的中间孩子很冷漠，很有心计。她一直觉得自己被父母忽视了，部分原因是{@creature Mirran|SKT}要求太高，{@creature Serissa|SKT}太年轻。事实上，{@creature King Hekaton|SKT}和内里王后对{@creature Nym|SKT}的爱和他们对其他女儿的爱一样多，但他们发现她很遥远，难以取悦。{@creature Nym|SKT}想让{@creature Mirran|SKT}夺取王位--然后，当{@creature Mirran|SKT}处处树敌，向所有人证明她不适合统治时，{@creature Nym|SKT}计划取代她。她已经收到了支持她争夺权力的预兆。与她那虚张声势的姐姐不同，{@creature Nym|SKT}担心法令解体的后果。尽管如此，{@creature Iymrith|SKT}已经说服了她，她有一个重要的命运要完成，如果她能使奥斯托利亚回归，诸神会奖励她。",
	"When {@creature King Hekaton|SKT} disappears, Princess {@creature Serissa|SKT} finds herself thrust into power. Unable to find her father and fearing that he might be dead, {@creature Serissa|SKT} can imagine her political influence evaporating quickly. Several giant lords previously under her father's thumb have abandoned her court and set out to impress the gods in ways that could all but destroy the civilizations of the small folk. {@creature Serissa|SKT} fears warfare among the six giant races as they strive to outdo one another, perhaps in the process reigniting the ancient conflict between giants and dragons. The princess-regent knows that her older sisters envy and despise her, but it has never occurred to her that they were involved in their mother's death or their father's kidnapping. Other than {@creature Iymrith|SKT} and her Uncle Uthor, there are few giants {@creature Serissa|SKT} feels she can trust.": "当{@creature King Hekaton|SKT}失踪后，公主{@creature Serissa|SKT}发现自己被推上了权力的舞台。由于无法找到她的父亲，又担心他可能已经死了，（%%2%）可以想象她的政治影响力会迅速消失。以前在她父亲手下的几个巨头领主已经放弃了她的宫廷，并开始以可能摧毁小民文明的方式来讨好诸神。{@creature Serissa|SKT}担心六个巨人种族之间会发生战争，因为他们会努力超越彼此，也许在这个过程中会重新引发巨人和龙之间的古老冲突。摄政王知道她的姐姐们羡慕和鄙视她，但她从未想过她们与母亲的死亡或父亲的绑架有关。除了{@creature Iymrith|SKT}和她的叔叔乌瑟尔之外，{@creature Serissa|SKT}觉得她可以信任的巨人不多。",
	"Hekaton left behind a piece of regalia called the {@item Korolnor Scepter|SKT}, a magic item that allows its owner to harness the powers of the {@item Wyrmskull Throne|SKT}. In accordance with her father's wishes, {@creature Serissa|SKT} has claimed the scepter and the throne. Even with the throne's magic at her command, she feels adrift. {@creature Serissa|SKT} wants to reach out to the small folk for help in finding her father, because she knows that despite their size, they are capable of great feats of heroism. But {@creature Iymrith|SKT} and Uthor have advised {@creature Serissa|SKT} to steer clear of them.

As the characters leave the temple for the last time, {@creature Iymrith|SKT} appears and attacks them. {@creature Harshnag|SKT} holds the ancient blue dragon at bay while the adventurers escape with or without the aid of mysterious dragon cultists and an airship.": "在{@adventure chapter 4|SKT|4}中，{@creature Harshnag|SKT}带领人物来到世界之脊下的一座神庙，在那里他们咨询了一个神圣的神谕。神谕要求冒险者找回埋藏在散布在北方的乌斯加特祖坟下的一些丢失的遗物。如果冒险者完成了神谕的任务，它就会告诉他们必须做什么来结束巨人的威胁。当人物最后一次离开神庙时，{@creature Iymrith|SKT}出现并攻击他们。{@creature Harshnag|SKT}压制住了古老的蓝龙，而冒险者们则在神秘的龙族崇拜者和一艘飞艇的帮助下或不帮助下逃跑。",
	"Chapters 5 through 9 describe the lairs of five giant lords threatening the North. Players choose which giant lord they wish to confront. This villain has a {@item conch of teleportation|SKT} that the characters need to reach Maelstrom, a storm giant stronghold in the depths of the Trackless Sea. {@adventure Chapter 10|SKT|11} describes the politically charged court of the storm giants and the challenges faced by its current ruler, Princess {@creature Serissa|SKT}.": "第五章至第九章描述了威胁北方的五个巨人领主的巢穴。玩家选择他们希望对抗的巨人领主。这个反派有一个{@item conch of teleportation|SKT}，角色需要到达无轨海深处的风暴巨人据点--漩涡。{@adventure Chapter 10|SKT|11}描述了风暴巨人的政治宫廷以及其现任统治者--公主{@creature Serissa|SKT}所面临的挑战。",
	"If the characters earn {@creature Serissa|SKT}'s trust, she tasks them with finding her father, {@creature King Hekaton|SKT}. The search for Hekaton is handled in {@adventure chapter 11|SKT|12}. Once freed from captivity, he joins forces with the party to slay the dragon {@creature Iymrith|SKT} in {@adventure chapter 12|SKT|13}. If Hekaton survives this final battle, he reclaims his throne. Otherwise, his daughter {@creature Serissa|SKT} becomes queen. In either event, the storm giants forge an alliance with the small folk against the enemies of giantkind: dragons. This act might be enough to restore the ordning as it was, or the future of the ordning might remain an open question in your campaign.": "如果人物获得了（%0%）的信任，她就会让他们去寻找她的父亲，（%1%）。寻找海卡顿的工作在（%2%）中进行。一旦从囚禁中解脱出来，他就会在{@adventure chapter 12|SKT|13}中与党派联合起来杀死龙{@creature Iymrith|SKT}。如果海卡顿在这场最后的战斗中幸存下来，他就能重新获得他的王位。否则，他的女儿（%5%）将成为女王。无论是哪种情况，风暴巨人都会与小民结成联盟，对抗巨人的敌人：龙。这一举动可能足以使军团恢复原状，或者军团的未来在你的战役中可能仍然是一个开放的问题。",
	"Once {@creature Iymrith|SKT} is defeated, the storm giants are happy to let the characters deal with the remaining evil giant lords as they see fit.": "一旦{@creature Iymrith|SKT}被打败，风暴巨人很乐意让角色们按照自己的想法处理剩余的邪恶巨人领主。",
	"{@i Storm King's Thunder} is not a \"ticking clock\" adventure, meaning that the characters are under no pressure to end the giant threat quickly. The plots of the giant lords take months to unfold, giving the characters time to explore the North, travel from place to place, and entertain distractions.": "{@i Storm King's Thunder}不是一个 \"计时 \"的冒险，也就是说，人物没有压力要迅速结束巨人的威胁。巨人领主的阴谋需要几个月的时间来展开，让人物有时间去探索北方，从一个地方到另一个地方，以及娱乐分心。",
	"Some players might feel a sense of urgency and stick to the main story line as much as possible, missing out on many elements of the adventure. Others might be willing to follow loose threads and stray from the main story, hoping to take the adventure in interesting new directions. The adventure allows for a fair amount of wandering. If you begin to think the party has wandered too far away from the main plot, you can use {@creature Harshnag|SKT} (see {@area chapter 3|287|x}) to help steer characters back to the main story. You can also have the characters meet faction members (see the \"{@area Factions in the North|13c|x}\" section) who can provide a sense of growing urgency and point characters in the right direction.": "有些玩家可能会有一种紧迫感，尽可能地坚持故事主线，从而错过了许多冒险的元素。其他人可能愿意跟随松散的线索，偏离主要故事，希望把冒险带到有趣的新方向。这场冒险允许有相当数量的游荡。如果你开始认为队伍已经偏离了主要情节，你可以使用（%0%）（见（%1%））来帮助引导人物回到主要故事。你也可以让角色遇到派系成员（见\"{@area Factions in the North|13c|x} \"部分），他们可以提供一种日益增长的紧迫感，并为角色指出正确的方向。",
	"You can begin the adventure with 5th-level characters by skipping over{@adventure chapter 1|SKT|1} and starting in one of the three locations described in {@adventure chapter 2|SKT|2}. {@adventure appendix A|SKT|14} suggests ways in which you can transition characters from the D&D {@i Starter Set} adventure or one of several other D&D adventures to {@adventure chapter 2|SKT|2} of {@i Storm King's Thunder}.": "你可以跳过{@adventure chapter 1|SKT|1}，从{@adventure chapter 2|SKT|2}中描述的三个地点中的一个开始冒险，用5级的角色开始。{@adventure appendix A|SKT|14}建议了一些方法，让你可以将角色从D&D{@i Starter Set}冒险或其他几个D&D冒险中的一个过渡到{@i Storm King's Thunder}的{@adventure chapter 2|SKT|2}。",
	"Rather than have you track experience points, this adventure assumes that the characters gain levels by accomplishing certain goals. At the end of each chapter is a \"Character Advancement\" sidebar, which tells you the circumstances under which the characters advance in level. The adventure flowchart (figure 0.1) shows what level the characters are expected to be when they begin each chapter. Once they reach 9th level, they don't advance to 10th level until they've completed the goals in both chapters 10 and 11.": "与其让你追踪经验值，这个冒险假设角色通过完成某些目标来获得等级。在每一章的末尾都有一个 \"角色进阶 \"的边栏，它告诉你角色在什么情况下会进阶。冒险流程图（图0.1）显示了人物在开始每一章时的预期等级。一旦他们达到第9级，在完成第10章和第11章的目标之前，他们不会升到第10级。",
	"Of course, you can ignore these milestones and track XP as normal.": "当然，你可以忽略这些里程碑，像平常一样追踪XP。",
	"Many of the encounters in this adventure are deadly by design. They test the players' ability to make smart, informed decisions under pressure. A deadly encounter might be the only encounter the characters have on a given day (and assumes the party is at full strength), or it might be so overwhelming that the characters are expected to avoid combat at all costs.": "这场冒险中的许多遭遇都是致命的设计。它们考验的是玩家在压力下做出明智、明智决定的能力。一个致命的遭遇可能是角色们在某一天唯一的遭遇（并且假设队伍是全员的），或者它可能是如此的压倒性，以至于角色们要不惜一切代价避免战斗。",
	"A total-party kill (\"TPK\") need not herald the end of the campaign. Giants and other intelligent creatures are fond of taking prisoners. The first time a TPK occurs, you can have the characters miraculously awaken as prisoners with 1 hit point each. Give them every chance to escape their captors. If necessary, use NPCs such as {@creature Zephyros|SKT}, the cloud giant wizard in {@adventure chapter 1|SKT|1}, to help them get out of tight spots. With luck, the players will take the hint and be wary of repeating the experience.": "一场全军覆没（\"TPK\"）并不一定预示着战役的结束。巨人和其他智慧生物都喜欢俘虏。第一次发生TPK时，你可以让角色奇迹般地醒来，成为每人只有1点生命值的囚犯。给他们一切机会来逃脱他们的俘虏。如果有必要，可以利用NPC，如{@creature Zephyros|SKT}，{@adventure chapter 1|SKT|1}中的云端巨型巫师，来帮助他们摆脱困境。运气好的话，玩家会接受暗示，并警惕重复这种经历。",
	"{@i Storm King's Thunder} contains a generous amount of treasure. This section provides guidance on how to handle certain kinds of treasure found in this adventure.": "{@i Storm King's Thunder}含有大量的财宝。本节就如何处理在这次冒险中发现的某些种类的宝藏提供指导。",
	"The number of coins in a creature's hoard is often represented as a die expression with a multiplier. For example, a giant might have {@dice 3d6 × 100} gp in a sack. To determine the number of coins in the sack, roll {@dice 3d6} and multiply the result by 100 to get a number between 300 and 1,800. Instead of rolling to determine the number of coins, you can pick an amount that falls within the specified range. If the characters have more loot than they known what to do with, take the minimum. If they seem light on treasure, take the average (in this case, 1,000 gp) or the maximum.": "一个生物的囤积物中的金币数量通常表示为带有乘数的模具表达。例如，一个巨人的袋子里可能有（%0%）金币。要确定麻袋中的硬币数量，需要掷出{@dice 3d6}，然后将结果乘以100，得到一个300到1800之间的数字。你可以在指定的范围内挑选一个数量，而不是通过滚动来确定金币的数量。如果人物的战利品比他们知道的要多，就取最小的。如果他们的财宝似乎不多，就取平均数（在本例中为1,000金币）或最大值。",
	"Sometimes a treasure hoard contains one or more magic items determined by rolling on the magic item treasure tables in chapter 7 of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG|7|Treasure Tables}. When determining a random magic item, roll a {@dice d100} (or have a player roll for you) and consult the specified table in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG|7|Treasure Tables}. If your players have a \"wish list\" of magic items, or you think a particular item might be useful to the party, you can forgo the roll and select an item from the table. For example, if the characters find a magic item tied to Magic Item Table B, and the party is light on water-breathing magic heading into {@adventure chapter 10|SKT|11}, you might decide that the item is a {@item potion of water breathing} or a {@item cloak of the manta ray}, both of which appear on Magic Item Table B in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG|7|Random Magic Items}.": "有时，一个宝藏包含一个或多个魔法物品，通过在{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG|7|Treasure Tables}第七章的魔法物品宝藏表上滚动来确定。当确定一个随机的魔法物品时，请掷出{@dice d100}（或让玩家为你掷出），并参考{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG|7|Treasure Tables}中的指定表格。如果你的玩家有一个魔法物品的 \"愿望清单\"，或者你认为某个特定的物品可能对聚会有用，你可以放弃掷骰子，从表中选择一个物品。例如，如果人物找到了与魔法物品表B相关的魔法物品，而队伍在进入{@adventure chapter 10|SKT|11}时对喷水魔法的需求很低，你可以决定该物品是{@item potion of water breathing}或{@item cloak of the manta ray}，两者都出现在{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG|7|Random Magic Items}的魔法物品表B中。",
	"Scattered throughout the adventure are art objects crafted to giant scale, including giant-sized pieces of jewelry, articles of clothing, and room decor. Although such art objects are often quite valuable, their size and weight make them difficult to transport. Characters must decide for themselves whether it's worth the trouble to carry these items. If the characters get greedy, use the variant encumbrance rules in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} to track what they can reasonably carry.": "在整个冒险过程中，散布着按巨大比例制作的艺术品，包括巨大的珠宝、衣服和房间装饰。虽然这些艺术品通常都很有价值，但它们的尺寸和重量使它们难以运输。角色必须自己决定是否值得为搬运这些物品而烦恼。如果人物变得贪婪，可以使用{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的变体负担规则来追踪他们可以合理携带的东西。",
	"In addition to treasure, giants often possess mundane items that they carry around in leather sacks or store in old chests. As the characters loot corpses and plunder giant hoards, throw in a few items chosen or rolled randomly from the Items in a Giant's Bag table. Items that are not giant-sized are sized for Small or Medium characters.": "除了宝藏之外，巨人还经常拥有一些普通的物品，他们用皮袋装着，或者存放在旧箱子里。当角色掠夺尸体和掠夺巨人的囤积物时，从巨人袋中的物品表中随机选择或滚动一些物品。不属于巨人的物品，其大小适合于小型或中型角色。",
