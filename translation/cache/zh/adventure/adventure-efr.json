	"\"Forgotten Relics\" is a short adventure for a party of four to six 1st-level characters, who advance to 2nd level by the adventure's conclusion. It is set in Sharn and serves as an introduction to the city. A balance of character classes is helpful, since the adventurers will face a variety of challenges.": "\"被遗忘的遗迹 \"是一个简短的冒险，适合四到六个一级角色，在冒险结束时提升到二级。它的背景是沙恩，是对这个城市的介绍。角色等级的平衡是有帮助的，因为冒险者们将面临各种挑战。",
	"Niho Koi, an imposing oni and Daask sub-boss in Sharn, ordered a half-ogre lieutenant named Garra to assemble a team and search the ruins of Old Sharn for arcane relics at the behest of someone much higher up in the organization. With a lot of ground to cover beneath the City of Towers, Garra kidnapped Caden d'Orien, the only son of Alden d'Orien, forcing Alden to use his position in his dragonmarked house to recruit out-of-work warforged—people no one would miss—to scour Old Sharn's ruins. Alden branded the work as a \"secret research-gathering mission\" for his house, paid the warforged workers for their silence, and signed them to binding contracts.": "Niho Koi是沙恩的一个威严的鬼魂和Daask副老板，他命令一个叫Garra的半鬼魂中尉组建一个团队，在组织中更高层的人的授意下，在旧沙恩的废墟中搜索奥术文物。由于塔楼之城下面有很多地方需要覆盖，Garra绑架了Alden d'Orien的独生子Caden d'Orien，迫使Alden利用他在龙纹之家的地位，招募失业的战争锻造者--没有人会错过的人--来搜寻旧沙恩的遗迹。奥尔登将这项工作打造成他家的 \"秘密研究-收集任务\"，为战神工人的沉默支付报酬，并与他们签订了具有约束力的合同。",
	"It took several weeks of dangerous exploring and a few deaths, but eventually the warforged workers found a library of arcane texts and schemas buried in the ruins. These items were moved to a Daask safe house in Tavick's Landing near the Terminus Lightning Rail station. The organization plans to smuggle the relics out Breland to Droaam with Alden's help.": "经过几周的危险探索和几人的死亡，最终战神工人发现了埋藏在废墟中的奥术文本和原理的图书馆。这些物品被转移到了塔维克兰丁（Tavick's Landing）靠近总站闪电铁路站的达斯克安全屋。该组织计划在奥登的帮助下，将这些遗物从布雷兰德偷运到德罗阿姆。",
	"Coal, a destitute warforged hired by Alden, witnessed her good friend Razor die, executed in the ruins of Old Sharn as an example to the other workers. Coal made an appointment to talk to Sergeant Germaine Vilroy of the Sharn Watch, to report the shady operation, Razor's murder, and the kidnapping of the House Orien scion, Caden. Thanks to crooked members of the Sharn Watch in Daask's pocket, Garra found out about the appointment and dispatched killers to prevent Coal from ratting out the operation.": "煤，一个被Alden雇佣的穷困潦倒的战争锻造者，目睹了她的好朋友Razor的死亡，在旧沙恩的废墟上被处决，作为其他工人的榜样。寇尔约好与沙恩守望的杰曼-维尔罗伊中士谈话，报告这个不光彩的行动、雷泽的谋杀以及奥瑞恩家族的子孙凯顿被绑架。多亏了达斯克口袋里的沙恩看守所的腐败成员，加拉发现了这个约会，并派出杀手阻止煤老板告发这次行动。",
	"Germaine is also crooked, but she is on the payroll of the Boromar Clan crime syndicate, whose members are enemies of Daask. Not wanting to put the Sharn Watch or herself between two criminal organizations at war, Germaine called in a few old contacts to meet with Coal and find out what's going on.": "杰曼也是个骗子，但她受雇于博洛玛氏族犯罪集团，其成员是达斯克的敌人。杰曼不想把沙恩观察站或她自己置于两个处于战争状态的犯罪组织之间，她叫来了几个旧的联系人，与煤炭公司见面，了解情况。",
	"This adventure requires the fifth edition D&D rulebooks ({@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, and {@book Monster Manual|MM}). You should read the entire adventure before attempting to run it. If you'd prefer to play, you shouldn't read any farther.": "这个冒险需要第五版D&D规则书（（%0%），（%1%）和（%2%））。在尝试运行它之前，你应该阅读整个冒险的内容。如果你喜欢玩，就不要再读下去了。",
	"Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.": "出现在这样的方框中的文字是为了让玩家在他们的角色第一次到达某个地点或在某个特定情况下大声朗读或转述，如文中所述。",
	"The {@book Monster Manual|MM} contains statistics for many of the creatures found in this adventure. When a creature's name appears in {@b bold} type, that's a visual cue pointing you to the creature's stat block in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}. If the stat block appears elsewhere, the adventure's text tells you so.": "{@book Monster Manual|MM}包含了这个冒险中发现的许多生物的统计数据。当一个生物的名字以{@b bold}的字体出现时，那是一个视觉提示，告诉你在{@book Monster Manual|MM}中该生物的状态块。如果状态块出现在其他地方，冒险故事的文字会告诉你。"
