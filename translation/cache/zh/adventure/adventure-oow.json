	"This chapter presents a complete Acquisitions Incorporated adventure divided into six episodes. Episode 1 is for players using shiny new 1st-level characters. They're ready to take on the world and hoping to become part-owners of a share in a valuable, prestigious Acquisitions Incorporated franchise—or at least gain a coveted internship with the organization.": "本章介绍了一个完整的收购公司冒险，分为六集。第1集是为使用闪亮的新一级角色的玩家准备的。他们已经准备好向世界挑战，并希望成为有价值、有声望的收购公司特许经营权的部分拥有者--或者至少获得一个令人羡慕的组织实习机会。",
	"At the end of each episode, characters gain a level. Each episode is an appropriate challenge for a party of four characters of the indicated level, but that challenge can be modified to accommodate your group. At the end of the sixth and final episode, the characters attain 7th level. But even more importantly, they will be fully vested in an operational and maybe even profitable Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. After that, the players and characters can take their treasure-hunting activities in any direction that you and they desire.": "在每一集结束时，角色会获得一个等级。每一集都是对指定级别的四名角色的适当挑战，但该挑战可以修改以适应你的团体。在第六集也就是最后一集结束时，人物达到了第七级。但更重要的是，他们将完全拥有一个可运营的、甚至可能盈利的收购公司特许经营权。在那之后，玩家和角色可以按照你和他们的意愿，在任何方向上进行寻宝活动。",
	"Between episodes, characters will use downtime to undertake a variety of activities to better themselves or their franchise. By later episodes, choices of downtime activities might alter the flow and challenge of the story. After all, there's no rest for the wicked, so there shouldn't be rest for heroes either. (Logically then, wicked heroes would need to work twice as hard. Budget the time.) Familiarize yourself with the new activities presented in \"{@book Franchise Tasks and Downtime|AI|1|Franchise Tasks and Downtime}\" in chapter 2 of this book, and with the standard D&D downtime activities discussed in that section.": "在两集之间，人物会利用停工期进行各种活动，以改善自己或其特许经营权。到后来的剧情中，对停工期活动的选择可能会改变故事的流程和挑战。毕竟，恶人是没有休息的，所以英雄也不应该有休息。(从逻辑上讲，邪恶的英雄需要加倍努力工作。编制时间预算）。熟悉本书第二章\"{@book Franchise Tasks and Downtime|AI|1|Franchise Tasks and Downtime} \"中介绍的新活动，以及该节中讨论的标准D&D停工活动。",
	"The {@book Monster Manual|MM} contains stat blocks for most of the creatures found in this adventure. All the necessary stat blocks are included there or in {@book appendix B|AI|4}. When a creature's name appears in {@b bold} type, that's a visual cue for you to look up the creature's stat block in the {@book Monster Manual|MM} or the monster appendix in this book.": "{@book Monster Manual|MM}包含了本冒险中发现的大多数生物的状态块。所有必要的状态块都包括在这里或{@book appendix B|AI|4}中。当一个生物的名字以{@b bold}的形式出现时，那是一个视觉提示，让你在{@book Monster Manual|MM}或本书的怪物附录中查找该生物的状态块。",
	"Spells and equipment mentioned in the adventure are described in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}. Magic items are described in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, except for the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI} and its components, described in {@book appendix D|AI|6}.": "冒险中提到的法术和装备在（%0%）中描述。魔法物品在{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中描述，除了{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}和它的组件，在{@book appendix D|AI|6}中描述。",
	"This part of the book is for the DM only. If you're planning to run through the adventure as a player, stop reading now! Unless you want to keep going, that is. Because seriously, it's not like anyone's going to stop you. After all, information is power—in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, and in life. Maybe you having a bit of an inside track is just what this adventure needs to make it really pop, and to keep the DM from getting all, \"Ooh, look at me! I'm the one with the secrets!\" I mean, can you believe how smug they are? It's like they're just begging you to turn the page...": "本书的这一部分只为管理员准备。如果你打算以玩家的身份进行冒险，现在就停止阅读吧！除非你想继续下去。除非你想继续下去，那就是。因为说真的，没有人会阻止你。毕竟，信息就是力量--在收购公司的活动中，以及在生活中。也许你有一点内幕消息正是这个冒险所需要的，以使它真正流行起来，并使DM不至于 \"哦，看我的！\"。我才是有秘密的人！\" 我的意思是，你能相信他们是多么自以为是吗？这就像他们只是在乞求你翻开这一页......",
	"The grand buffet that is an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign features plenty of the exciting locations and high adventure common to all great fantasy campaigns. But an Acq Inc game adds a unique helping of humor and corporate intrigue to the mix, creating a rich narrative familiar to anyone who's watched an Acquisitions Incorporated livestream game. To take full advantage of the potential of an Acq Inc campaign, keep the following concepts in mind.": "盛大的自助餐是收购公司的活动，其中有很多令人兴奋的地点和所有伟大的幻想活动中常见的高度冒险。但是，Acq公司的游戏在混合中加入了独特的幽默和企业阴谋，创造了丰富的叙事，这对任何观看过Acquisition Incorporated直播游戏的人来说都很熟悉。为了充分利用Acq公司活动的潜力，请牢记以下概念。",
	"This campaign provides many NPCs for you to do with as you please. They all have roles to play in the encounters and events of the adventure, but what happens to them after that is up to you. Every NPC could be a potential ally, enemy, or foil later in the campaign. If the players take a shine to one, bring that character back—or better yet, make the NPC an integral part of the ongoing plot. All franchises need servants and hirelings to do mundane jobs, and NPCs the characters already know are a great fit for these roles. Employ these NPCs to make the world feel more familiar and real to the players and characters alike.": "这个活动为你提供了许多NPC，你可以随意处置。他们在冒险的遭遇和事件中都有作用，但之后发生在他们身上的事情就取决于你了。每个NPC都可以成为潜在的盟友、敌人，或者在以后的活动中成为陪衬。如果玩家对某个角色感兴趣，就把这个角色带回来，或者更好的是，让这个NPC成为正在进行的情节的一个组成部分。所有的特许经营都需要仆人和雇工来做平凡的工作，而人物已经认识的NPC是这些角色的最佳人选。使用这些NPC，使玩家和角色对这个世界感到更加熟悉和真实。",
	"Even the most heroic heroes sometimes fall short. And in many cases, adventurers aren't even within longbow range of \"virtuous\" in their motivations. As such, what the characters fail to do, do poorly, or do wrongly can be just as important as what they accomplish. Don't let failure and setbacks derail an adventure or a campaign. Rather, look for ways that failure or partial success might lead to new ways to reach a campaign goal.": "即使是最英勇的英雄有时也会落空。而且在许多情况下，冒险家的动机甚至不在长弓的 \"美德 \"范围内。因此，角色的失败、做得不好或做得不对可能与他们的成就一样重要。不要让失败和挫折使冒险或活动脱轨。相反，要寻找失败或部分成功可能导致实现活动目标的新方法。",
	"You might be absolutely confident that the characters will save those townsfolk and earn their trust, letting you use the townsfolk to reveal an important quest goal. But if the town burns down despite the heroes' best intentions—or because they had better things to do—let them be mistaken for local authorities come to lend a hand in the aftermath. Or let them be unexpectedly arrested after being mistaken for the evil forces that burned the town down, and given the dangerous quest out of animosity. Humor plays a big part in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, so make use of unheroic irony whenever the players and characters provide it.": "你可能绝对相信人物会拯救那些乡民，并赢得他们的信任，让你利用乡民来揭示一个重要的任务目标。但是如果镇子被烧毁了，尽管英雄们的意图是好的，或者是因为他们有更好的事情要做，那么就让他们被误认为是当地政府来帮忙善后的。或者让他们在被误认为是烧毁小镇的邪恶势力后被意外逮捕，并因敌意而获得危险的任务。幽默在收购公司的活动中起着很大的作用，所以只要玩家和角色提供了非英雄式的讽刺，就可以利用它。",
	"Wow. Can you believe the advice your players are getting in that sidebar on the last page? And after all the time you're going to put in getting ready to run this adventure? Outrageous! Someone needs to teach these people a lesson.": "哇。你能相信你的玩家在最后一页的侧边栏中得到的建议吗？在你花了那么多时间准备进行这次冒险之后？太离谱了! 有人需要给这些人上一课。",
	"If you're running the adventure for larger or smaller groups, you can adjust the encounters using the guidelines given in chapter 3, \"{@book Creating Adventures|DMG|-1},\" in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}. Or maybe you'll adjust them anyway to keep things interesting. And never forget that you can change up any aspects of the adventure to make them a better fit for your campaign. Swap monsters around to keep the players guessing, or make use of the adventure's many suggestions for side treks and additional encounters. That'll keep these so-called heroes in line.": "如果你为较大或较小的团体进行冒险，你可以使用第三章\"{@book Creating Adventures|DMG|-1} \"中给出的准则来调整遭遇战。也可能你会调整它们，以保持事情的趣味性。永远不要忘记，你可以改变冒险的任何方面，使它们更适合你的活动。把怪物换来换去，让玩家猜来猜去，或者利用冒险中的许多建议来进行旁门左道和额外的遭遇战。这将使这些所谓的英雄们保持一致。",
	"By its most basic nature, a roleplaying game campaign focuses on the actions of the characters. However, it's important to remember that the world goes on without them. The heroes can't be everywhere at once. If they establish a base in one town but spend a lot of time away, anything could happen to that base. Hirelings might grow disenchanted in the characters' service if abused, neglected, or left to their own devices for too long. Ramp up the drama and the humor of a campaign by occasionally focusing on what the characters neglected or left behind.": "就其最基本的性质而言，角色扮演游戏活动的重点是人物的行动。然而，重要的是要记住，没有他们，世界也在继续。英雄们不可能同时出现在任何地方。如果他们在一个城镇建立了一个基地，但却花了很多时间在外面，那么这个基地就可能发生任何事情。如果被虐待、被忽视或被放任自流太久，雇佣者可能会对人物的服务感到失望。通过偶尔关注人物被忽视或遗弃的东西来增加活动的戏剧性和幽默感。",
	"An Acquisitions Incorporated franchise is like a newborn baby that the characters all had a hand in conceiving, delivering, and raising. It needs constant care and feeding as it grows to its full potential, but there'll be a lot of risks, drama, and dirty diapers along the way. (Okay, that might be taking the analogy too far, but you get the idea.) Running a franchise can be difficult, but the potential rewards for the characters are tremendous. And for the players, making the franchise the focal point of the campaign provides a joint goal and a shared vessel of creative input.": "收购公司的特许经营权就像一个新生的婴儿，所有角色都参与了孕育、分娩和抚养。它需要不断的照顾和喂养，以充分发挥其潜力，但在这一过程中会有很多风险、戏剧和脏尿布。(好吧，这个比喻可能太远了，但你明白这个意思。)经营一个特许经营权可能是困难的，但对角色的潜在回报是巨大的。而对于玩家来说，将特许经营权作为活动的焦点，提供了一个共同的目标和一个共同的创造性投入的容器。",
	"This adventure touches on a number of classic tropes in its setup and execution. Artifact of incalculable power accidentally stumbled upon? Check. Evil faction with plans to end the world? Got it. But even against potentially world-shattering events and plots, an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign is always centered around humble characters making choices—including one unfortunate NPC whose choices have set the adventure in motion.": "这场冒险在其设置和执行过程中触及了许多经典套路。意外发现了具有不可估量的力量的神器？没错。计划结束世界的邪恶派别？是的。但是，即使是面对可能震惊世界的事件和阴谋，收购公司的活动总是围绕着卑微的角色做出选择--包括一个不幸的NPC，他的选择使冒险开始了。",
	"A year ago, a group of adventurers led by a dwarf named Caerhan Coalsmith found a strange object buried in the remains of a ruined tower. The relic appeared to be a golden orrery housing, missing its geared clockwork components. It was obviously a magic item of some kind, but arcane lore wasn't the party's strong suit, so the orrery was set aside while Caerhan investigated its provenance and history.": "一年前，由一个名叫Caerhan Coalsmith的矮人带领的一群冒险家发现了一个埋在废塔遗迹中的奇怪物体。这个遗物似乎是一个金色的口轮外壳，缺少了齿轮式的发条部件。这显然是某种魔法物品，但奥术理论并不是这个团队的强项，所以在卡伊尔汗调查它的来源和历史时，这个口簧被放在一边。",
	"The dwarf heard a few tales about devices that matched the relic's description. Though he never learned the full scope of its powers, rumors told of how those powers would increase if a magic orrery's missing components were collected and placed within it. Unfortunately, Caerhan also never learned about the curse the orrery carried—and his party paid the price.": "矮人听说过一些关于符合遗物描述的设备的故事。虽然他从未了解过它的全部力量，但有传言说，如果收集到一个魔法饰品的缺失部件并将其放入其中，这些力量就会增强。不幸的是，凯尔汉也从来没有了解过魔戒所携带的诅咒--他的队伍付出了代价。",
	"As an artifact, the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI} comes with a random major detrimental property (see the \"{@book Artifacts|DMG|7|Artifacts}\" section in chapter 7 of the {@i {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG})}. The specifics of that property when the orrery housing was found are left up to you, but whatever it was (compulsion to evil for someone in the party, hostile life force, imprisoned death slaad, yadda yadda), Caerhan returned from a research trip to Candlekeep to find his fellow party members all dead.": "作为一件神器，{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}附带一个随机的主要有害属性（见{@i {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}第七章中的\"{@book Artifacts|DMG|7|Artifacts} \"部分）}。发现兽皮屋时，该属性的具体情况由你决定，但无论它是什么（对党内某人的强迫性邪恶，敌对的生命力，被囚禁的死亡之士，哒哒哒），Caerhan从Candlekeep的研究之旅回来时，发现他的党员同伴都死了。",
	"Recognizing too late that the orrery housing channeled dark power, the grieving Caerhan decided that the relic must be destroyed. However, its artifact-level magic made it seemingly impervious to harm. More research was undertaken with the help of Caerhan's goblin sidekick, Gorkoh. In the end, Caerhan concluded that the best place to ensure the orrery's end was a secret shrine to destruction beneath Waterdeep, rumored to be able to destroy even powerful magic relics. So the pair packed up and headed for the City of Splendors.": "悲痛欲绝的卡恩决定必须毁掉这个遗物，但他认识到这是黑暗力量的源泉，为时已晚。然而，它的神器级魔法使它似乎不受伤害。在Caerhan的妖精伙伴Gorkoh的帮助下，进行了更多的研究。最后，凯尔汉得出结论，确保神器终结的最佳地点是沃特迪普地下的一个秘密的毁灭神殿，据传它甚至能摧毁强大的魔法遗迹。于是两人收拾行装，前往辉煌之城。",
	"The veteran dwarf adventurer located the underground tunnels leading to the shrine easily enough. He and Gorkoh braved those dangerous passages, but were separated during an encounter with a carrion crawler. Caerhan pressed on. But when he activated the shrine, he caused a minor earthquake that opened a sinkhole in Waterdeep's Dock Ward, and which cracked walls and sidewalks across the city. In the end, the orrery housing was too strong even for the destructive power of the shrine, and Caerhan died during his heroic attempt to rid the world of the dangerous device. Now, the orrery waits for someone else to take possession of it.": "这位资深的矮人冒险家很容易就找到了通往神殿的地下通道。他和Gorkoh勇敢地走过这些危险的通道，但在遇到腐肉爬行者时被分开了。Caerhan继续前进。但当他启动神殿时，他引起了一场小地震，在沃特迪普的码头区打开了一个天坑，并使整个城市的墙壁和人行道开裂。最后，即使对于神龛的破坏力来说，箭塔的外壳也太强大了，卡伊尔汗在他为世界摆脱危险装置的英勇尝试中死去。现在，这个神器正等待着别人来拥有它。",
	"As the characters will learn in time, the orrery and its components were intentionally scattered long ago. But the pieces of the orrery maintain a connection, and have been steadily making their way toward each other for years. With one piece permanently held by the orrery's creator in the Greypeak Mountains, the other components and the orrery housing have ended up scattered across the Sword Coast, falling into the hands of different adventuring groups. One of those groups is the evil faction known as the Six, whose members have become aware of the orrery's existence—and have a full understanding of its potential for destructive power. That power is described in the orrery write-up in {@book appendix D|AI|6}.": "正如主人公将及时了解到的那样，这个金字塔和它的组成部分在很久以前就被有意地分散了。但是金字塔的碎片保持着一种联系，多年来一直在稳定地走向彼此。其中一块由位于格雷皮亚克山脉的神器创造者永久持有，其他部件和神器外壳最终散落在整个剑海岸，落入不同的冒险团体手中。其中一个团体是被称为 \"六人帮 \"的邪恶派别，他们的成员已经意识到了箭塔的存在--并且完全了解其潜在的破坏性力量。这股力量在{@book appendix D|AI|6}中的口诀中有所描述。",
	"As the characters are drawn into contact with the orrery, they discover that two of the artifact's components have been claimed by Acquisitions Incorporated franchises that have come under recent attack by unknown foes. The rival faction of Dran Enterprises becomes a prime suspect, with its agents found on the scene for both attacks. And all the while, the shadowy members of the Six pull together a tangled plot to gain control of the orrery to destroy Acquisitions Incorporated—and bring ruin to Faerûn.": "当这些人物被吸引去接触神器时，他们发现神器的两个部件已经被收购公司的特许经营权认领，而这些特许经营权最近遭到了未知敌人的攻击。德兰企业的敌对派别成为主要嫌疑人，它的代理人被发现在两次袭击的现场。与此同时，\"六人帮 \"的阴暗成员还策划了一个纠缠不清的阴谋，以获得对神器的控制权，从而摧毁收购公司--为法鲁恩带来毁灭。",
	"As the adventure unfolds, the characters travel hither and yon across the Sword Coast and the North, checking in on some classic adventure locations and exploring a number of brand-new sites. Map 1.1 shows the sites and locations featured in \"The Orrery of the Wanderer.\"": "随着冒险的展开，角色们在剑海岸和北方的各个地方旅行，查看一些经典的冒险地点，并探索一些全新的地点。地图1.1显示了 \"流浪者的奥瑞尔 \"中的景点和地点。",
	"In episode 1 of the adventure, a case of mistaken identity gives the characters a rare opportunity to make a name for themselves in Acquisitions Incorporated. Their assigned task is to investigate a sinkhole fissure that opened up in Waterdeep after a small earthquake struck the city—the side effect of Caerhan Coalsmith's failed attempt to destroy the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}. If the characters can conclude the investigation successfully, Acquisitions Incorporated CEO Omin Dran presents them with a unique chance to rise within the ranks of the organization.": "在冒险的第一集里，一个错误的身份给了人物一个难得的机会，让他们在收购公司里扬名立万。他们的任务是调查沃特迪普市在发生小地震后出现的天坑裂缝--这是卡恩-库尔斯密斯摧毁{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}的尝试失败后的副作用。如果角色们能成功完成调查，收购公司的首席执行官Omin Dran会给他们提供一个独特的机会，让他们在组织中晋升。",
	"Before diving headlong into the events of \"The Orrery of the Wanderer\" campaign, you might wish to spend some time having the characters experience and explore the city of Waterdeep. The adventure {@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH} and the \"Volo's Waterdeep Enchiridion\" section of that book (available at the DMs Guild as a separate download—{@link www.dmsguild.com|http://www.dmsguild.com}) provide a ton of information about the City of Splendors.": "在一头扎进 \"流浪者的修道院 \"活动之前，你可能希望花一些时间让角色体验和探索沃特德普城。这个冒险{@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH}和该书中的 \"沃特德普百科全书 \"部分（可在DMs公会单独下载-{@link www.dmsguild.com|http://www.dmsguild.com}）提供了大量关于辉煌之城的信息。",
	"Additionally, you can make use of the following rumors that characters might hear on the streets or in the taverns of that great metropolis. Some of these rumors tie to the adventure, while the truth of others depends on your wishes for the campaign. Either way, feel free to use these rumors as inspiration for new encounters or side treks.": "此外，你还可以利用以下传言，这些传言是人物在那个大都市的街头或酒馆里可能听到的。其中一些谣言与冒险有关，而其他谣言的真相则取决于你对活动的愿望。无论怎样，请自由使用这些传言作为新的遭遇或侧重点的灵感。",
	"Omin Dran is one of the fabled Masked Lords of Waterdeep. His presence on the council is the impetus for beneficial changes sweeping across the city.": "奥明-德兰是传说中的水底世界蒙面领主之一。他在议会中的存在是席卷整个城市的有益变化的推动力。",
	"Omin Dran is definitely not one of the Masked Lords of Waterdeep. The addition to the council of such a power-hungry and ruthless individual would spell the end of the rule of law in the City of Splendors.": "奥明-德兰绝对不是水底城的假面领主之一。这样一个渴望权力、冷酷无情的人加入议会，将意味着辉煌之城的法治的终结。",
	"The earthquake that hit the city two days ago wasn't natural. Strong magic unleashed underground caused it—maybe even magic from Undermountain.": "两天前袭击城市的地震并不是自然的。地下释放的强大魔法造成了它--甚至可能是来自地下山的魔法。",
	"Acquisitions Incorporated is making a play for control in the city, and the other power groups of Waterdeep are not going to let that happen without a fight. The recent hostilities between groups such as the Xanathar Guild and the Zhentarim have been made even worse by the increasing sway of the company.": "收购公司正在争夺城市的控制权，而沃特迪普的其他势力团体也不会让这种情况不经意间发生。最近Xanathar公会和Zhentarim等团体之间的敌对行动，由于该公司的影响力越来越大而变得更加严重。",
	"A noble merchant in the South Ward survived an assassination attempt last night. A female half-elf was seen fleeing the scene, bearing a deep cut on her shoulder from a bodyguard's blade. A 50 gp bounty has been offered for bringing her in alive for questioning.": "昨晚，南区的一位贵族商人在一次暗杀行动中幸存下来。有人看到一名女性半精灵逃离了现场，她的肩膀上有一道被保镖的刀子划破的伤口。有人悬赏50金币，希望能活捉她进行审问。",
	"A killer is stalking the streets of the North Ward, murdering people in broad daylight. The victims' feet are chopped off, as if by a powerful blow with a sharp blade. Then they're decapitated. The heads are left behind, but the feet are taken!": "一个杀手在北区的街道上徘徊，在光天化日之下谋杀人们。受害者的脚被砍掉，就像被一把锋利的刀子强力打击一样。然后他们被斩首。头部被留下，但脚却被带走了!",
	"The famous Waterdavian actor Tystanya Creed has not been seen since leaving the theatre after her last performance several days ago. Her adoring fans fear she is dead.": "著名的Waterdavian演员Tystanya Creed在几天前最后一次演出后离开剧院后就再也没有出现过。她的崇拜者担心她已经死了。",
	"Towering forms in black cloaks have been seen around the City of the Dead at night. A number of witnesses swear that those cloaks and their deep hoods concealed skeletal forms.": "夜晚，人们在死亡之城周围看到穿着黑色斗篷的高大身影。一些目击者发誓，这些斗篷和它们的深色罩子掩盖了骷髅的形状。",
	"A green dragon was spotted flying over the Sea of Swords just west of the city. The Blackstaff and her team are on high alert in case it ventures closer or harasses ships in the area.": "一条绿龙被发现在城市西部的剑海上空飞行。黑杖和她的团队正处于高度警惕状态，以防它冒险靠近或骚扰该地区的船只。",
	"One of the great walking statues of Waterdeep has been reported to be crying over the last three days. No one is sure about the cause of this watery discharge from the eyes, but some say it means the destruction of the City of Splendors is imminent! Others are certain it's a sign of great fortune on the horizon. Still others say it's just the humidity.": "据报道，在过去的三天里，沃特德普的一个伟大的步行雕像一直在哭泣。没有人确定这种眼睛流泪的原因，但有人说这意味着辉煌之城的毁灭迫在眉睫! 另一些人则肯定这是一个伟大的财富即将到来的标志。还有人说这只是湿度问题。",
	"Members of the Guild of Chandlers and Lamplighters are going on strike, leaving the streets of Waterdeep dark and dangerous around the next new moon. The thieves and assassins of the city are already getting prepared for a night of carnage.": "Chandlers和Lamplighters公会的成员正在进行罢工，在下一个新月前后，水底世界的街道将变得黑暗而危险。这个城市的盗贼和刺客们已经开始为一夜的屠杀做准备了。",
	"The adventure begins with the characters seeking franchise opportunities or internships at the Waterdeep offices of Acquisitions Incorporated. All the characters should know the popular tales of that well-known organization and might have ties to Acq Inc (especially characters with one of the {@book backgrounds|AI|2|Backgrounds} from {@book chapter 3|AI|2}).": "冒险开始时，人物在收购公司的Waterdeep办公室寻求特许经营机会或实习机会。所有的角色都应该知道那个著名组织的流行故事，并且可能与Acq公司有联系（尤其是与{@book chapter 3|AI|2}的{@book backgrounds|AI|2|Backgrounds}之一的角色）。",
	"Sure, I get it. Your first time meeting Omin Dran can be intimidating. But just remember, under all that armor is a merciless psychopath infused with the power of a god.": "当然，我明白。你第一次见到奥明德兰可能会被吓到。但请记住，在所有的盔甲下是一个被注入神的力量的无情的精神病患者。",
	"For a nervously long length of time, the characters are kept waiting in a conference room at Head Office. Read or paraphrase the following to begin:": "在一段紧张的时间里，这些人物一直在总部的会议室里等待。阅读或转述以下内容，开始。",
	"Your inquiries into internships and franchise opportunities at Acquisitions Incorporated have gone even better than you'd hoped. Ridiculous rumors talk about how prospective interns of Acq Inc aren't always treated with respect, dignity, or care. Even more ridiculous tales of interns dying at an alarming rate are told throughout the city. Thankfully, you don't believe a word of any of that.": "你对收购公司的实习和特许经营机会的询问比你希望的还要顺利。荒谬的传言谈到Acq公司的未来实习生并不总是受到尊重、尊严和关怀。整个城市还流传着关于实习生以惊人的速度死亡的更荒唐的故事。值得庆幸的是，你一个字都不相信。",
	"So far, everyone at Head Office has treated you with kindness, and even a bit of deference. You were shown into this elegant conference room, given fine food and drink, and asked to wait to speak with none other than Omin Dran—founder and CEO of this august organization.": "到目前为止，总部的每个人都对你很客气，甚至有点恭敬。你被带进了这个优雅的会议室，得到了精美的食物和饮料，并被要求等待与这个庄严组织的创始人兼首席执行官奥明-德兰交谈。",
	"If the characters already know each other, they were ushered into the conference room as a group. If they came to Head Office separately, they were each brought in alone and asked to wait with the others, and have a chance to introduce themselves before Omin appears.": "如果这些人物已经互相认识，他们就会被作为一个团体带进会议室。如果他们分别来到总部，他们各自被单独带入，并被要求与其他人一起等待，并在奥明出现之前有机会介绍自己。",
	"It isn't long before the door to the conference room opens, and an intense-looking half-elf in plate armor enters. He wears a holy symbol of Tymora, the goddess of fortune, around his neck. It's Omin Dran! With no introduction, the CEO of Acquisitions Incorporated speaks.": "没过多久，会议室的门打开了，一个身穿板甲、神情紧张的半精灵走了进来。他的脖子上戴着财富女神泰莫拉的神圣标志。这就是奥明-德兰! 不用介绍，收购公司的首席执行官就开口了。",
	"\"Thank you for answering my call so quickly. When the earthquake struck the city two days ago, damage was limited, but a sinkhole opened up a fissure beneath an abandoned warehouse in Dock Ward. Two City Watch guards entered the fissure to investigate, but never came out. They're now feared dead, and the City Watch has asked me to take over the investigation. But my schedule is complicated at the moment, so I'm delegating that job to you. As an experienced adventuring group, I have no doubt that you can handle the task.\"": "\"谢谢你这么快就接了我的电话。两天前地震发生时，损失有限，但一个天坑在码头区一个废弃的仓库下面打开了一个裂缝。两名城市守卫进入裂缝进行调查，但再也没有出来。他们现在恐怕已经死了，而城市守望要求我接手调查。但我现在的日程安排很复杂，所以我把这项工作委托给你。作为一个经验丰富的冒险团，我毫不怀疑你们能处理好这项任务。\"",
	"Before you have any chance to respond, Omin drops a hefty bag of coins onto the table. \"The pay is 500 gold dragons for the group, with a 20 percent commission going to Acquisitions Incorporated as the broker. Go to the warehouse next to Jolly's Lamp Emporium down by the docks. Tell the City Watch guards stationed there that I sent you.

	"Then without another word, Omin Dran turns and leaves the room.": "然后没有再说话，奥明德兰转身离开了房间。",
	"Through a crazy and never-to-be-explained misunderstanding, Omin believes that the characters are a group of experienced adventurers that he put out a call for just the day before. If the characters attempt to correct this misunderstanding, he ignores them. The CEO of Acquisitions Incorporated has important business to deal with, and can't be bothered with such trifles.": "通过一个疯狂的、无法解释的误解，Omin认为这些角色是他前一天刚发出的一群有经验的冒险家。如果角色们试图纠正这种误解，他就不理会他们。收购公司的首席执行官有重要的业务要处理，不可能为这些琐事而烦恼。",
	"When visiting Head Office, never approach Omin directly. Use the proper forms and filing procedures. After a brief four-month waiting time, you will be granted a very generous sixty-second meeting.

	"With absolutely no idea what they're meant to do or how they got into this position, the characters might try to seek out assistance before they leave Head Office. Or they might just wander around lost for a bit. Either way, Jim Darkmagic approaches the group with some words of... well, let's call it wisdom. When it's time for Jim to make his appearance, read or paraphrase the following:": "由于完全不知道自己要做什么，也不知道自己是怎么走到这一步的，这些人物可能会在离开总部之前试图寻求帮助。或者，他们可能只是迷路了一下。无论哪种情况，吉姆-黑魔王都会用一些......嗯，让我们称之为智慧的话来接近这群人。当吉姆出场的时候，请阅读或解读以下内容。",

	"Jim's reasons for interceding with the characters are left to your determination. He might have intercepted the experienced adventurers Omin called for, then sent them off on a secret personal mission on his own behalf. Or he might have accidentally set them on fire when they arrived at Acquisitions Incorporated Head Office. Whatever the case, he needs the players' group to attempt Omin's mission, and he's keen to get them on their way.": "吉姆与这些人物交涉的原因由你决定。他可能拦截了奥明要求的有经验的冒险家，然后以他自己的名义派他们去执行一项秘密的个人任务。或者当他们到达收购公司总部时，他可能不小心放火烧了他们。不管是什么情况，他需要玩家的团队去尝试Omin的任务，而且他很想让他们上路。",
	"If the characters have any questions about the assignment, Jim can be the vessel through which you answer. Those who appear enthusiastic, appreciative, and deferential to Jim might even be gifted a {@item spell scroll} of {@spell Jim's magic missile|AI}.

If the characters have spent time in the city, they might have heard that much of this ward is set up as safe houses, meeting places, and fronts for a variety of criminal organizations, including the Xanathar Guild and the Zhentarim. None of these groups are particularly happy right now, since the sinkhole caused by the earthquake opened up smack dab in the middle of their territory. The sinkhole also brought the Waterdeep City Watch to the ward, a move welcomed by no one—least of all the members of the Watch, who must now stand guard over the site until it can be investigated and closed.": "Omin的任务是把角色带到Waterdeep的Dock Ward，一个由肮脏的公寓、粗糙的街道和更粗糙的小巷组成的迷宫。如果角色们在这个城市呆过，他们可能听说这个区的大部分地方都被设置成安全屋、聚会场所，以及各种犯罪组织的幌子，包括Xanathar公会和Zhentarim。这些组织现在都不太高兴，因为地震造成的天坑正好开在他们的地盘中间。这个天坑还把沃特迪普城市守卫队带到了病房，此举没有人欢迎，尤其是守卫队的成员，他们现在必须在现场站岗，直到调查和关闭。",
	"A character whose background entails knowledge of the ward knows the general layout of its streets and alleys, but finding Jolly's Lamp Emporium and the abandoned warehouse requires asking for directions at some point. Use the following encounters as a general setup, but you can add additional encounters as the characters make their way through the ward as you see fit.": "一个背景需要了解该区的人物知道其街道和小巷的大致布局，但要找到乔利的灯饰店和废弃的仓库需要在某些时候问路。你可以把下面的遭遇作为一般的设置，但你可以在人物通过病房时增加你认为合适的其他遭遇。",

Several pieces of parchment are on display in the stall, with six small ceramic pots placed next to them.": "一个沿街摆放的破烂摊位上挂着一个牌子，上面写着。\"地图和Poshuns\"。摆摊的是一个脏兮兮但却很欢快的地精顽童。摊位上摆着几张羊皮纸，旁边放着六个小陶罐。",
	"The rapscallion is Jerronimous \"Jerr\" Burntberry (CN male gnome {@creature commoner}) who is quite a bit older than he looks. A successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check tips the characters off that the adult gnome is disguised to look like a youngster. Jerr hopes to join the Zhentarim one day, but he needs a little more experience. In the meantime, he makes a living by scribbling on pieces of parchment he scrounges from garbage heaps, selling them as maps to unwitting fools searching for places in Dock Ward. He also collects fetid rainwater in small, red clay pots, which leach out just enough color that he can pass the water off as {@i potions of healing}.": "这个说唱歌手是Jerronimous \"Jerr\" Burntberry（CN男地精（%0%）），他比他看起来要老很多。一个成功的DC15智慧（{@skill Insight}）检查提示人物，这个成年地精被伪装成一个年轻人的样子。杰尔希望有一天能加入赞塔林，但他需要更多的经验。在此期间，他靠在从垃圾堆里搜来的羊皮纸上涂鸦为生，把它们当作地图卖给那些不知情的傻瓜，让他们去寻找码头区的地方。他还用红色的小陶罐收集发臭的雨水，这些陶罐浸出的颜色刚好可以让他把水当做（%2%）。",
	"The potions have a faintly fruity aroma. A {@spell detect magic} spell shows that they are indeed magical, though that magic is of the transmutation school rather than conjuration. Each day, a kindly druid who thinks Jerr is an honest soul gives the gnome a goodberry for his health. Rather than eat the berry, Jerr crushes it up and adds a drop of juice to each pot. Jerr sells maps for 1 gp and the potions for 10 gp. He also tries to sell other useless or counterfeit objects at your discretion.": "这些药水有一种淡淡的水果香味。一个{@spell detect magic}的咒语显示它们确实有魔力，尽管这种魔力是转化学派的，而不是魔法。每天，一个好心的德鲁伊认为杰尔是一个诚实的灵魂，他给地精一个好的浆果，让他健康。杰尔没有吃浆果，而是把它压碎，在每个锅里加一滴果汁。杰尔以1戈比出售地图，以10戈比出售药水。他还试图出售其他无用或伪造的物品，由你决定。",
	"If the adventurers ask Jerr to be a guide, he happily takes the job for 1 gp. He then leads the characters straight into an ambush by a gang working for the Zhentarim (see the \"Skeleton Crew\" encounter below).

	"If you wish, Jerr can become a recurring character in the campaign. He might keep tabs on the characters as they grow famous, showing up in cities where they travel, trying to sell more useless goods, or eventually spying on them for the Zhentarim. Or if paid and treated well, he could become a valuable source of information for the characters when they need someone to infiltrate tough areas.": "如果你愿意，杰尔可以成为活动中的一个重复出现的角色。他可能会在人物成名后盯着他们，出现在他们旅行的城市里，试图出售更多无用的货物，或者最终为Zhentarim监视他们。或者，如果得到报酬和良好的待遇，当人物需要有人潜入艰难地区时，他可以成为一个有价值的信息来源。",
	"As the characters make their way farther into Dock Ward, they encounter street thugs growing increasing resentful of the presence of the City Watch. These thugs need to earn some quick coin, then lay low until the Watch leaves the ward. And mugging the next group of distracted strangers to wander down the wrong street seems like just the ticket.": "随着人物深入到码头区，他们遇到了街头暴徒，对城市守望的存在越来越反感。这些暴徒需要快速赚取一些钱财，然后在守望先锋离开区之前低调行事。抢劫下一群在错误的街道上徘徊的心不在焉的陌生人，这似乎正是机会。",

	"If the characters save Kal, he looks at them with the same grin. He doesn't express gratitude, though, because his mind wanders through a different level of existence, as is the case for many mystics, celebrities, and financial planners.

	"Otis can be used as a wild card later in this episode of the adventure.

	"Once the characters' identities are \"confirmed,\" they might have some questions for the guards. Use the following points to steer the conversation—and make sure to work in the first three points as a warning from the guards, even if the players fail to seek more information:": "一旦角色的身份被 \"确认\"，他们可能会有一些问题要问守卫。使用以下几点来引导对话--确保将前三点作为守卫的警告，即使玩家没有寻求更多信息。",
	"The fissure opened beneath the warehouse during the earthquake two days ago. The partially collapsed building has been deemed structurally sound, so it shouldn't fall into the fissure unless someone inside does something foolish, such as knock down a support beam or bang against the remaining walls.": "两天前的地震中，仓库下面的裂缝打开了。部分倒塌的建筑被认为结构良好，所以它应该不会落入裂缝，除非里面有人做了一些愚蠢的事情，比如打倒一根支撑梁或撞到剩余的墙壁。",

	"The contract the characters sign is fulfilled only if they investigate and clear every tunnel the fissure exposed. After they finish, a city surveyor will be assigned to map the area, and an engineer needs to assess the integrity of the tunnels to ensure that no further collapses are imminent. If either professional is injured or killed because of negligence on the part of the adventurers, the party and Acquisitions Incorporated can be held liable.": "只有当他们调查并清除裂缝暴露的每条隧道时，这些人物签署的合同才会得到履行。他们完成后，将指派一名城市测量员绘制该地区的地图，一名工程师需要评估隧道的完整性，以确保没有进一步的坍塌即将发生。如果因为冒险者的疏忽而导致任何一个专业人员受伤或死亡，该党和收购公司可以被追究责任。",
	"Two members of the City Watch—Sergeant Ava Teeshe and Constable Yander Boot—descended into the fissure a day earlier to make sure it held nothing dangerous. From the bottom of the sinkhole, they followed an underground passage north. They haven't been seen or heard from since.": "城市守望的两名成员--阿瓦-提舍中士和扬德-布特警员--在一天前潜入裂缝，以确保其中没有危险。从天坑底部，他们沿着地下通道向北走。此后，他们再也没有被人看到或听到。",

Before diving headlong into the events of \"The Orrery of the Wanderer\" campaign, you might wish to spend some time having the characters experience and explore the city of Waterdeep. The adventure {@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH} and the \"Volo's Waterdeep Enchiridion\" section of that book (available at the DMs Guild as a separate download—{@link www.dmsguild.com|http://www.dmsguild.com}) provide a ton of information about the City of Splendors.": "前一天晚上在南区的一次刺杀行动失败后，羽毛正在低调行事（见本集前面的\"{@area Life in Waterdeep|00b|x} \"侧边栏），并假装是乔利的助手。成功通过DC15智慧（{@skill Medicine}或{@skill Perception}）检查，可以让角色注意到羽的动作很僵硬，好像她的肩膀受了重伤。在一头扎进 \"漫游者的奥瑞尔 \"活动的事件之前，你不妨花些时间让角色体验和探索沃特迪普城。这场冒险{@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH}和该书中的 \"沃特德普百科全书 \"部分（可在DMs公会单独下载-{@link www.dmsguild.com|http://www.dmsguild.com}）提供了大量关于辉煌之城的信息。",
	"Jolly does his best to get the adventurers out of his shop as quickly as possible. If asked about the earthquake or the fissure beneath the warehouse next door, he says only that he heard the ground shake and felt the warehouse cave in. If the adventurers threaten force and succeed on a DC 10 Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) check, they can convince Jolly to give up the one useful piece of information he knows. The tunnels beneath the warehouse were used by thieves at one time, but they were abandoned because of unknown dangers that came up from the darkness below. Jolly has no idea what those dangers might be.": "乔利尽力让冒险家们尽快离开他的商店。如果被问及地震或隔壁仓库下面的裂缝，他只说他听到地面震动，感觉仓库塌陷了。如果冒险者以武力相威胁，并在DC10魅力（（%0%））检查中获得成功，他们可以说服乔利交出他所知道的一个有用的信息。仓库下面的隧道曾经被盗贼使用过，但是因为下面的黑暗中出现了未知的危险而被放弃了。乔利不知道这些危险可能是什么。",
	"When the fissure opened up at the bottom of the sinkhole, it exposed a number of tunnels used for a variety of purposes and by a multitude of people over the years. The first of the tunnels beneath the warehouse were dug as smugglers' byways. Later, worshipers of That-Which-Endures (see the sidebar in the \"{@book New Race: Verdan|AI|2|New Race: Verdan}\" section in chapter 3) excavated chambers beneath the ground to hold clandestine meetings and worship at a secret shrine of destruction. Various thieves' guilds employed the tunnels to move from place to place secretly. Renegade wizards did terrible experiments there. At one point, part of the Waterdeep sewer system crossed into the tunnel network. Not long after, the subterranean spaces were abandoned.": "当天坑底部的裂缝打开时，它暴露了许多隧道，多年来被许多人用于不同的目的。仓库下面的第一条隧道是作为走私者的通道而挖掘的。后来，那啥啥的崇拜者（见第三章\"{@book New Race: Verdan|AI|2|New Race: Verdan} \"部分的侧边栏）在地下挖掘了一些房间，举行秘密会议，并在一个秘密的毁灭圣地进行崇拜。各种盗贼行会利用这些隧道从一个地方秘密地转移到另一个地方。叛逆的巫师们在那里做着可怕的实验。有一次，沃特迪普下水道系统的一部分穿过了隧道网络。不久之后，地下空间被遗弃了。",
	"As a result of the earthquake, many of the tunnel system's side passages have been blocked by rubble. The limited zone that is still traversable leads the characters from the fissure to the lost shrine of destruction—and through a number of dangerous areas in between.": "由于地震的影响，隧道系统的许多侧面通道都被瓦砾堵住了。仍可穿越的有限区域将人物从裂缝引向失落的毁灭圣地--并在两者之间穿过一些危险区域。",
	"When the adventurers enter the warehouse, read:": "当冒险者进入仓库时，请阅读。",
	"In the areas where the walls and ceiling didn't collapse, this warehouse contains no crates, no boxes, no barrels, and no wares of any other kind. Directly in front of the missing door, the walls, ceiling, and floor have fallen away to reveal a deep sinkhole fissure. Inside the ruin, a hempen rope anchored firmly in the rubble dangles down into the darkness. The tear in the earth descends at an angle, making it impossible to see how far down it goes or what waits at the bottom.": "在墙壁和天花板没有倒塌的地方，这个仓库里没有板条箱，没有盒子，没有木桶，也没有任何其他种类的物品。在缺失的门的正前方，墙壁、天花板和地板已经脱落，露出一个深深的天坑裂缝。在这个废墟里，一条牢牢固定在瓦砾中的麻绳垂落在黑暗中。地面上的裂缝以一定的角度下降，使人无法看到它有多深，也无法看到底部有什么在等待着。",
	"Descending into the fissure is easily done by characters using the rope, but requires a successful DC 10 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check by anyone climbing down the rough stone walls. On a failed check, a character tumbles down the sloping fissure and takes 3 ({@dice 1d6}) bludgeoning damage.": "使用绳索的角色很容易就能下到裂缝中，但需要任何从粗糙的石壁上爬下来的人成功地进行DC 10力量（（%0%））检查。如果检定失败，角色就会从倾斜的裂缝中翻滚下来，并受到3({@dice 1d6})的重击伤害。",

	"The sinkhole fissure ends at a level floor of worked stone. Dust, debris, rocks, and pieces of wood that once made up the walls and ceiling of the warehouse above are spread across the floor. An underground passage is blocked to the south, but it continues into darkness to the north. Two pairs of human-sized boot prints, easily spotted in the dust, head northward. Smaller fissures, holes, and cracks riddle the passage, though even a halfling would find the largest of them a tight fit.": "天坑裂缝的尽头是一个由加工过的石头组成的平坦地板。灰尘、碎片、石头和曾经构成上面仓库的墙壁和天花板的木头碎片散布在地板上。南面的地下通道被封锁了，但它继续向北进入黑暗。两双人类大小的鞋印，在灰尘中很容易被发现，向北走。较小的裂缝、孔洞和裂纹在通道中随处可见，不过即使是半身人也会发现其中最大的裂缝也很难适应。",

	"After the first character has been at the bottom of the fissure for 2 rounds, a group of six {@creature Giant Rat||giant rats} notices the potential feast. Any character at the bottom of the fissure who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check can hear the approaching rats, and isn't surprised when three rats emerge from cracks in the walls and attack. Three more rats arrive and attack 1 round later. All the rats are dyed a bright green from trap C in {@area area 3|03a|x}.": "在第一个角色在裂缝底部待了2个回合后，有6个（%0%）人注意到了这个潜在的大餐。任何在裂缝底部的角色，只要成功通过DC12智慧（（%1%））检查，就能听到老鼠的接近，当三只老鼠从墙壁的裂缝中出现并攻击时，他们并不感到惊讶。1个回合后，又有3只老鼠到达并发动攻击。所有的老鼠都被{@area area 3|03a|x}中的陷阱C染成了鲜绿色。",
	"When the final rat dies, it coughs up a humanoid finger bearing a platinum ring worth 20 gp. Etched inside the ring is the name \"Burton Boot.\" The ring belonged to the father of Yander Boot, the deceased constable of the Watch, and was bitten off by the rat after Boot was killed (see {@area area 5|049|x}).": "当最后一只老鼠死亡时，它会咳出一个人形的手指，上面有一个价值20金币的铂金戒指。戒指里面刻着 \"伯顿-布特 \"的名字。这枚戒指属于已故的守望先锋警员杨德-布特的父亲，在布特被杀后被老鼠咬掉了（见（%0%））。",
	"The earthquake sealed many of the passages that once made up this underground maze. As the characters explore, they pass through worked tunnels, natural caverns, and functional sewers at different points. Most side passages are blocked by rubble, making the path of the two Waterdeep City Watch guards easy to follow.": "地震封住了许多曾经构成这个地下迷宫的通道。随着人物的探索，他们会在不同的地方通过工作通道、天然洞穴和功能性下水道。大多数侧面的通道都被瓦砾挡住了，使得两个水底城守卫的路径很容易被追踪。",

	"This rectangular chamber shows no earthquake damage, possibly because of the buttresses and columns supporting the walls and ceiling. Four pools of liquid are set into the floor—one blue, another green, a third clear, and the last cloudy. Carvings on the walls seemingly depict the pools, and show robed figures submerging themselves within. At the far end of the chamber stands a double door with a large, ornately carved lock.": "这个长方形的房间没有显示出地震的破坏，可能是因为有支撑墙壁和天花板的壁架和柱子。地板上有四个液体池，一个是蓝色的，一个是绿色的，一个是透明的，最后一个是浑浊的。墙壁上的雕刻似乎描绘了这些池子，并显示出穿着长袍的人在里面浸泡。在密室的远端矗立着一扇双扇门，门上有一个巨大的、华丽的雕刻的锁。",
	"The pools represent the trials the characters must undertake to pass the test of That-Which-Endures. Each pool is 10 feet deep and has sheer sides.

	"When the characters enter the chamber from the south, Dabshabah is fending off a pair of darkmantles, so they can hear the fight before they see it.": "当人物从南边进入密室时，达布沙巴正在抵挡一对黑螳螂，所以他们在看到战斗之前就能听到战斗的声音。",
	"A small, brass-colored dragon thrashes madly at the far end of the cavern, trapped beneath two large boulders that block a northern tunnel. Two dark creatures resembling flying squids dart just out of the little dragon's reach, harassing it. Another northern tunnel is also blocked with rubble. Only a tunnel to the east stands clear of debris.": "一条黄铜色的小龙在洞穴的远端疯狂地跳动，它被困在两块大石下面，这两块大石堵住了北面的通道。两只类似飞天鱿鱼的黑暗生物在小龙触手可及的地方飞奔，骚扰着它。另一条北面的隧道也被碎石堵住了。只有东边的一条隧道没有碎石。",
	"The two {@creature Darkmantle||darkmantles} understand that the dragon is doomed to eventually die of its wounds, and that they can have an easy meal in a few hours if they bide their time. They are thus staying out of the dragon's reach. Dabshabah can't use her breath weapon against the darkmantles because the weight of the boulders makes it hard for her to breathe.": "这两个人{@creature Darkmantle||darkmantles}明白，这条龙注定最终会死于伤痛，而如果他们韬光养晦，几个小时后就能轻松吃上一顿。因此，他们在龙的视线范围之外。达布沙巴不能用她的呼吸武器来对付黑曼陀罗，因为巨石的重量使她难以呼吸。",
	"When the characters engage the darkmantles, the monsters ignore the dragon to focus on the new threat. Both creatures fight to the death.": "当人物与黑魔兽交战时，怪物们无视龙的存在，专注于新的威胁。两种生物都在拼死搏斗。",
	"If the characters defeat the darkmantles, Dabshabah (a {@creature brass dragon wyrmling}) is thankful. If they use magic to heal the wounds she suffered during the earthquake, she is even more grateful. However, she expresses that gratitude with an inflated sense of her importance in the world. Remember that dragons aren't like people. Even the good ones can be haughty, proud, entitled, demanding, self-involved, and prone to violence. (Okay, maybe they are like people.)": "如果人物打败了黑魔王，达布沙巴（%0%）很感激。如果他们用魔法治愈了她在地震中遭受的创伤，她就更加感激。然而，她在表达这种感激之情时，对自己在这个世界上的重要性有一种膨胀的感觉。记住，龙和人不一样。即使是好的龙也可能是傲慢的、骄傲的、有权利的、要求高的、自以为是的，而且容易发生暴力。(好吧，也许他们像人。）",
	"Dabshabah is less than a year old, and she shares the story of how a green dragon attacked her and her siblings, driving her away from her mother's territory and down the Sword Coast. She can also confirm that she saw an armed and armored female human—Sergeant Ava Teeshe—pass through this chamber and head east some hours ago. Dabshabah kept silent, fearing the human would slay her.": "达布沙巴还不到一岁，她讲述了一条绿龙如何袭击她和她的兄弟姐妹，把她从母亲的领地赶到剑海岸的故事。她还可以证实，她看到一个武装和装甲的女性人类--艾娃-提舍中士--在几个小时前穿过这个房间，向东走去。达布沙巴保持沉默，担心这个人类会杀了她。",
	"Large capital assets such as dragons are a good investment. But you need to remember to record them on your balance sheet at the original cost minus depreciation due to the minor dismemberment or occasional consumption of staff.": "像龙这样的大型资本资产是一项不错的投资。但你需要记住在资产负债表上以原始成本减去因员工的轻微肢解或偶尔的消耗而产生的折旧来记录它们。",
	"Waterdeep is protected by a magical ward that keeps dragons from entering the city. The ward doesn't reach this far below ground, so Dabshabah is safe here. However, if the characters attempt to bring her out of the fissure, she can't follow them. The dragon whines and sobs when it becomes clear that the characters must leave her behind. Arranging to meet somewhere outside the city quiets her, but Dabshabah demands assurances that the party won't abandon her.": "沃特德普受到一个魔法阵的保护，使龙无法进入城市。这个魔法阵并没有到达地下这么远，所以达布沙巴在这里是安全的。然而，如果角色们试图把她带出裂缝，她就不能跟着他们。当角色们清楚地知道必须把她留下时，这条龙就会呜呜地哭起来。安排在城外的某个地方见面使她安静下来，但达布沙巴要求保证党不会抛弃她。",
	"It might be fun to run Dabshabah as an NPC member of the party for a bit. However, any dragon—even a chaotic good wyrmling—can be tough to manage. Townsfolk are likely to be terrified at the prospect of a dragon coming into their shops and taverns. Moreover, caring for Dabshabah to her own high standards, including meeting her needs for sustenance and treasure, is equivalent to maintaining a character in a wealthy lifestyle.": "将达布沙巴作为党内的一个NPC成员来管理可能会很有趣。然而，任何龙--即使是混乱的好巫妖--都很难管理。镇民们可能会因为一条龙进入他们的商店和酒馆而感到害怕。此外，按照她自己的高标准照顾达布沙巴，包括满足她对食物和财宝的需求，相当于维持一个角色的富裕生活。",
	"That said, having Dabshabah stay with the party for a short time, then take off on her own to learn the business of being a dragon, could provide a bit of poignant narrative in your campaign. Much later on, if the characters are ever facing long odds in an important battle, Dabshabah might swoop down from the sky to return the favor the heroes once did for her.": "也就是说，让Dabshabah和队伍呆上一小段时间，然后自己去学习做龙的事情，可以在你的战役中提供一点凄美的叙述。以后，如果角色们在一场重要的战斗中面临巨大的困难，达布沙巴可能会从空中俯冲下来，以回报英雄们曾经对她的帮助。",
	"In this final area of the caverns, the characters discover the missing City Watch guard, the dead dwarf who caused all this mess—and a magical mystery that kicks off the rest of the adventure. When the characters enter this area, read:": "在岩洞的最后一个区域，角色们发现了失踪的城市守卫，发现了造成这一切混乱的死去的侏儒--还有一个神奇的谜团，开启了冒险的其他部分。当人物进入这个区域时，请阅读。",
	"This crumbling chamber is dominated by an altar against the far wall, above which hangs some kind of construct gearwork mechanism ending in a massive maul. The wall to the left of the altar has fallen in to spread rubble across the floor. On the floor near the altar is a golden device resembling an orrery housing. The device is battered and falling apart, revealing exposed gears and spokes, and with its exterior pieces and plating scattered across the floor. Splayed on the ground next to the device is the corpse of a dwarf.": "这个破败的密室被一个靠着远处墙壁的祭坛所支配，上面悬挂着某种结构性的齿轮装置，最后形成一个巨大的大锤。祭坛左侧的墙壁已经倒塌，碎石遍布地板。祭坛附近的地板上有一个金色的装置，类似于一个圆形的外壳。这个装置被撞得七零八落，露出了暴露的齿轮和辐条，其外表的碎片和镀层散落在地板上。在装置旁边的地面上，躺着一具矮人的尸体。",
	"In the southwest corner of the room stands a muscular female human dressed in the livery of the Waterdeep City Watch. Her eyes are closed, and she breathes deeply as though resting.": "在房间的西南角，站着一个肌肉发达的女性人类，穿着沃特迪普城市守卫的制服。她闭着眼睛，深呼吸，似乎在休息。",
	"The dead dwarf is Caerhan Coalsmith. Sergeant Teeshe stands in the corner. The magical housing of the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI} sits before the altar.": "死去的矮人是卡汉-库尔斯米斯。蒂谢中士站在角落里。祭坛前坐着（%0%）的魔法住房。",
	"Teeshe touched the altar when she first entered this area, and a spirit loyal to That-Which-Endures possessed her (see below). If the adventurers touch or disturb anything in this chamber (including the altar, the gearwork maul, or Teeshe herself), the spirit controlling Sergeant Teeshe forces her to attack. Use the {@creature thug} stat block for her in this state.": "蒂舍在第一次进入这个区域时触碰了祭坛，一个忠于That-Which-Endures的灵魂附身于她（见下文）。如果冒险者触碰或打扰这个密室中的任何东西（包括祭坛、齿轮加工锤或蒂谢本人），控制蒂谢中士的灵魂会迫使她进行攻击。在这种状态下，对她使用{@creature thug}的状态块。",
	"The gearwork device above the altar is called an entropy guardian, and it animates 1 round after Teeshe attacks. The entropy guardian's expanding clockwork arms allow it to attack anywhere in the room, but it cannot attack beyond it. On initiative count 10, it makes two attacks per round: +4 to hit, 7 ({@dice 1d8 + 2}) bludgeoning damage. The damaged entropy guardian is a Huge object with AC 18, 32 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. It focuses its attacks on intruders within 5 feet of the altar, anyone fighting with Sergeant Teeshe, and anyone holding the orrery housing (which its magic recognizes as an ongoing threat).": "祭坛上方的齿轮装置被称为 \"熵守护者\"，它在提舍攻击后的1个回合内会产生动画。熵守卫者膨胀的发条臂使它可以攻击房间里的任何地方，但它不能攻击房间以外的地方。在主动权计数为10时，它每回合进行两次攻击。命中率+4，7({@dice 1d8 + 2})重击伤害。受损的熵守护者是一个巨大的物体，AC值为18，命中率为32，对毒药和精神伤害有免疫力。它的攻击重点是在祭坛5英尺范围内的入侵者，任何与特谢中士战斗的人，以及任何持有兽皮箱的人（它的魔法将其识别为持续的威胁）。",
	"The altar is made of granite and covered in runes. It accepts offerings by destroying them with the attacks of the entropy guardian, representing the entropic power of That-Which-Endures. However, the ancient altar malfunctioned when Caerhan set the orrery housing on it—or perhaps the orrery channeled its own powerful magic to destroy the altar in self-defense. Either way, that pulse of power caused the earthquake, and saw the entropy guardian slay the unfortunate Caerhan when it took him as a threat to the shrine.": "祭坛由花岗岩制成，上面布满了符文。它接受祭品的方式是用熵的守护者的攻击来摧毁它们，代表着 \"那个-那个-结束 \"的熵的力量。然而，当卡伊尔汗在祭坛上设置了口器外壳时，古老的祭坛出现了故障--或者也许是口器引导它自己强大的魔法来摧毁祭坛以进行自我防御。不管怎么说，那股力量的脉冲引起了地震，并且看到熵的守护者把不幸的凯尔汉当成了对神殿的威胁而杀死了他。",
	"A character who touches the altar willingly must succeed on a DC 12 Charisma saving throw or be {@condition charmed} by a spirit loyal to That-Which-Endures. While {@condition charmed} in this way, the character must use its action each turn to attack any creature defiling the shrine. This effect lasts for as long as the affected creature remains in this area, but the compulsion also prevents the creature from leaving the shrine.": "一个自愿触碰祭坛的角色必须在DC12魅力救赎中成功，否则就会被一个忠于That-Which-Endures的灵魂所控制。在这样的情况下，该角色必须在每一回合使用其行动来攻击任何玷污神坛的生物。只要受影响的生物还在这个区域内，这个效果就会持续下去，但这个蛊惑也会阻止该生物离开神殿。",
	"The City Watch officer is under the sway of a possessing spirit from the altar, as noted above. She attacks any creatures that appear to be a threat to the shrine, but a successful DC 13 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check allows a character to see the unfocused look in her eyes, as if she's not in control of her actions. If she can be removed from this area, the altar's power over her ends, and Teeshe comes back to her right mind. If the characters save her, the sergeant offers a {@item potion of healing} in thanks. She doesn't remember what happened to her after entering the tunnels with Constable Boot, and is keen to accompany the characters back out.": "如上所述，这位城市守望官员受到来自祭坛的附身灵的支配。她攻击任何看起来对神坛有威胁的生物，但成功通过DC13智慧（（%0%））检查，可以让角色看到她眼中没有焦点的神情，好像她没有控制自己的行动。如果她能被移出这个区域，祭坛对她的力量就会结束，蒂谢就会回到她的正常思维。如果人物救了她，中士会提供{@item potion of healing}作为感谢。她不记得和布特警员一起进入隧道后发生了什么事，她很想陪着人物一起回去。",
	"If a character tries to identify the runes on the altar, a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana} or {@skill Religion}) check determines only that they are connected to no known deity, but that their symbology associates them with the power of destruction and ruin. The magic of the altar and the gearwork maul is faltering, but would once have been capable of destroying even powerful magic items.": "如果一个角色试图识别祭坛上的符文，成功通过DC15智力（{@skill Arcana}或{@skill Religion}）检查，就能确定它们与任何已知的神灵有关，但它们的符号学将它们与破坏和毁灭的力量联系起来。祭坛和齿轮锤的魔力正在减弱，但曾经有能力摧毁强大的魔法物品。",
	"Any character who succeeds on the above check or on a DC 12 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check to study the destruction here determines that a powerful pulse of magical power centered in this area is likely what caused the earthquake. The character also intuits that with the shrine's destructive magic curtailed by the earthquake, it is no longer a threat.": "任何通过上述检查或通过DC12智力检查来研究这里的破坏情况的人物都会确定，以这个区域为中心的强大的魔法力量脉冲很可能是造成地震的原因。该人物还直觉到，由于地震遏制了神殿的破坏性魔法，它不再是一个威胁。",
	"The {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI} is a powerful magic artifact, detailed in {@book appendix D|AI|6}. In its present state, the orrery has been battered by the entropy guardian, though its six-sided form remains intact. Its side plating is mostly missing, but can be collected from the floor nearby. If characters replace any of the shattered side plating, it magically reattaches itself. More oddly, if the characters don't replace the plating, it begins to regrow, even as the orrery housing magically straightens itself out.": "{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}是一件强大的魔法神器，详见{@book appendix D|AI|6}。在其目前的状态下，这口塔已经被熵的守护者击打过了，尽管它的六面体仍然完好。它的侧板大部分都不见了，但可以从附近的地板上收集。如果人物替换了任何一块破碎的侧板，它就会神奇地重新连接起来。更奇怪的是，如果人物不更换镀层，它就会开始重新生长，甚至是像铁匠铺一样神奇地恢复了原状。",
	"Within a few days, the orrery housing is a pristine, golden six-sided device with a circular hole in each face. The setup of gears and attachments within the orrery makes it clear that six round components are meant to be placed into the device. Characters will not recall seeing any such devices in the shrine of destruction.": "几天之内，口轮外壳是一个原始的、金色的六面装置，每个面都有一个圆孔。箭塔内的齿轮和附件的设置清楚地表明，六个圆形的部件是要放入这个装置的。人物不会记得在毁灭神殿中看到过任何这样的装置。",
	"With Sergeant Teeshe saved (or with her body in tow and a convenient cover story), the characters can make their way back to the sinkhole. If they left any dangers behind them on their initial pass, those dangers reemerge on the trip back—and will prevent them from fulfilling their contract if not eliminated.": "在救出特谢中士后（或拖着她的尸体和一个方便的掩护故事），角色们可以回到天坑的路上。如果他们在最初的旅程中留下了任何危险，这些危险就会在回去的路上重新出现--如果不消除这些危险，他们就无法履行合同。",
	"When the characters climb out of the sinkhole, Captain Truff is waiting for them alone, and is pleased to see them. She's even more pleased if the characters rescued Sergeant Teeshe. Truff asks the characters to sign an affidavit confirming that they've completely investigated and cleared the passages beyond the fissure. If the characters lie about the success of their mission, they risk a fine, imprisonment, or both.": "当人物爬出天坑时，特鲁夫船长正独自等待他们，看到他们很高兴。如果角色们救出了Teeshe警长，她会更加高兴。特鲁夫要求他们签署一份宣誓书，确认他们已经完全调查并清理了裂缝之外的通道。如果他们在任务成功的问题上撒谎，就有可能被罚款、监禁，或者两者兼而有之。",
	"The characters must also agree to have all the goods they found beneath the city inventoried. If anyone later claims to be the rightful owner of any of the loot, a magistrate might rule that the goods belong to the original owner instead of the characters. Who knew adventuring required so much paperwork?": "角色们还必须同意将他们在城市下面发现的所有货物清点出来。如果后来有人声称自己是任何战利品的合法主人，地方法官可能会裁定这些货物属于原主人而不是人物。谁知道冒险需要这么多文书工作？",
	"While the NPCs and characters are going over their bookkeeping, a group of villains working for the Xanathar Guild tries to take any treasure the party pulled out of the tunnels. The group consists of a {@creature thug} called Stork leading three {@creature Bandit||bandits}. Stork believes she has the advantage over the party members, who are probably coming out of the tunnels bruised and bloodied. Plus, she's already bribed the two City Watch guards, Orvis Torval and Rosko Bosh, to \"take a walk,\" so neither is on hand during the attack.": "当NPC和角色们正在翻阅他们的账本时，一群为Xanathar公会工作的恶棍试图夺走党派从隧道中拉出的任何财宝。这群人由一个叫斯托克的（%0%）带领三个（%1%）组成。斯托克认为她比党员们更有优势，他们很可能是满身是血地从隧道里出来。另外，她已经贿赂了两个城市守卫，奥维斯-托瓦尔和罗斯科-波什，让他们 \"出去走走\"，所以在攻击期间他们都不在现场。",
	"Captain Truff fights alongside the characters, as do Gorkoh and Sergeant Teeshe if the characters rescued them. Otis Adalgrim might show up too, either during or after the fight.": "特鲁夫船长与角色们并肩作战，如果角色们救了他们，戈尔科和提舍中士也会出现。奥蒂斯-阿达格雷姆（Otis Adalgrim）也可能出现，在战斗中或战斗后出现。",
	"With this first episode completed, the characters attain 2nd level! But even as they get to bask in the warm glow of that achievement, they must return to Acquisitions Incorporated to report. Omin Dran is there to meet with them when they do.

	"Having since learned about the initial mistaken identity when he met the characters, Omin is even more impressed by their success.

	"Once the characters formally establish their franchise at the end of episode 2, downtime activities and franchise tasks will play a bigger role in the adventure.

	"Although the characters have no way to discover this fact at present, the attack on Tresendar Manor was carried out by operatives working for the Six. That dark cabal of dark individuals wants to bring dark forces into the world—and its members have a specific motive of wanting to destroy Acquisitions Incorporated in the process. However, most of the agents involved in the attack had no idea they were working for the Six. All were hired individually and clandestinely by one of its members—the goblin {@creature Splugoth the Returned|AI}, who made no mention of his identity or allegiance.": "虽然这些人物目前无法发现这一事实，但对特伦达庄园的袭击是由为六人帮工作的特工人员实施的。这个由黑暗人士组成的黑暗集团想把黑暗势力带入这个世界--其成员有一个特定的动机，就是想在这个过程中摧毁收购公司。然而，参与袭击的大多数特工都不知道他们在为六人帮工作。所有的人都是被其成员之一--小妖精（%0%）单独秘密雇佣的，他没有提到自己的身份或效忠。",
	"The appearance of Dran Enterprises at the end of this episode is meant very much to imply that the organization was involved in the attack—and to distract the characters and the players alike from speculating on what other nefarious operators might be involved. The plots of the Six are revealed over the course of the adventure. More information on the Six, Splugoth, and Dran Enterprises can be found in \"{@book Factions and Rivals|AI|2|Factions and Rivals}\" in {@book chapter 3|AI|2}, and in {@book appendix B|AI|4}.": "在这一集的结尾，德兰企业的出现在很大程度上是为了暗示该组织参与了这次袭击，并分散人物和玩家的注意力，让他们不去猜测还有哪些邪恶的经营者可能参与其中。在冒险过程中，六人帮的阴谋将被揭露。关于六人帮、Splugoth和Dran企业的更多信息可以在{@book chapter 3|AI|2}的\"{@book Factions and Rivals|AI|2|Factions and Rivals} \"和{@book appendix B|AI|4}中找到。",
	"The trek from Waterdeep to Phandalin requires the adventurers to travel north on the High Road, then head east along the Triboar Trail before taking the track south into town. Walking at a normal pace, it takes about 6 days to travel from Waterdeep to the head of the Triboar Trail, 1 day to hike along the Triboar Trail to the track to Phandalin, then another 4 hours to reach the town.": "从沃特迪普到潘达林的徒步旅行需要冒险者沿着大道向北走，然后沿着特里波尔小道向东走，再沿着小道向南进入城镇。以正常的速度行走，从沃特德普到特里波尔小道的起点大约需要6天时间，沿着特里波尔小道徒步走到通往潘达林的小道需要1天时间，然后再花4个小时到达小镇。",
	"This first part of the episode features three encounters covering the journey from Waterdeep to Phandalin, all of which offer connections to the rest of the adventure. If you want your campaign to move at a quick pace, run only these encounters. In doing so, you don't have to worry about random encounters and setting up details of the journey such as who keeps watch when the characters camp.": "这一集的第一部分有三个奇遇，涵盖了从沃特迪普到潘达林的旅程，所有这些奇遇都提供了与冒险的其他部分的联系。如果你想让你的活动以快速的速度进行，就只进行这些遭遇战。这样一来，你就不必担心随机遭遇和设置旅途中的细节，如人物扎营时由谁看守。",
	"If you prefer to emphasize the dangerous nature of the adventuring life for lower-level characters, random encounters can be used to create additional tension along the road. As characters gain levels and access to diverse powers, random wilderness encounters become less of a threat, so this is a great point in the campaign to use random encounters to challenge the party.": "如果你喜欢强调低级别的角色的冒险生活的危险性，可以用随机遭遇来创造沿途的额外紧张。随着角色等级的提高和获得不同的力量，随机的野外遭遇变得不那么具有威胁性，所以这是活动中使用随机遭遇来挑战队伍的一个好时机。",

	"Kofutacti, a {@creature young green dragon}, is touring the Sword Coast looking for trouble (see the \"{@area Life in Waterdeep|00b|x}\" sidebar in episode 1). Thankfully for the characters, the dragon is a cowardly sort that prefers intimidation to combat, and which backs away from most fights.

	"As the party skirts the Mere of Dead Men on the High Road, they come across a lizardfolk being intimidated and harassed by an unscrupulous Zhentarim merchant and his bodyguards.": "当一行人绕过公路上的死人谷时，他们遇到了一个蜥蜴人，被一个无耻的赞塔林商人和他的保镖恐吓和骚扰。",
	"This part of the High Road runs parallel to the Mere of Dead Men, a swamp full of dangers, pestilence, and death. Alongside the road, a lizardfolk is pleading with a male human dressed in black leather. Behind the dark figure, two bugbears stand with their morningstars drawn, staring at the lizardfolk with menace in their eyes.": "高路的这一部分与死人沼泽平行，这是一个充满危险、瘟疫和死亡的沼泽。在路边，一个蜥蜴人正在恳求一个穿着黑色皮革的男性人类。在这个黑暗的身影后面，两只虫人拔出晨星站在那里，用威胁的眼神盯着蜥蜴人。",
	"The human shouts loudly enough for you to hear. \"Not acceptable! Friends, show this walking fish my displeasure.\"": "人类大声地喊叫，足以让你听到。\"不能接受! 朋友们，向这只步行鱼表示我的不悦。\"",

	"If the characters attempt to involve themselves in the altercation, Rasqel rudely orders them to go do things that are possible only during one of the less-restrained services in a temple of Loviatar. If the characters fail to leave after this warning, Rasqel gives them an ultimatum: they can walk away or face the wrath of the Zhentarim.": "如果人物试图参与争吵，拉斯克尔就会粗暴地命令他们去做只有在洛菲亚塔神庙中的某个不太受约束的仪式中才可能做的事情。如果人物在这一警告后没有离开，拉斯克尔就会给他们下最后通牒：他们可以走开，或者面对赞塔林的愤怒。",
	"A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check can tell that Rasqel seems unsure about the bite behind his threat. His little operation is off the books, with no sanction from his superiors in the Black Network. The bugbear bodyguards know this fact too, and because of it, they are less than enthusiastic about working for Rasqel.": "通过DC15智慧（%0%）检查成功的人物可以看出，拉斯克尔似乎对他的威胁背后的咬合力不确定。他的小行动是不公开的，没有得到他在黑网中的上级的批准。虫族保镖们也知道这个事实，正因为如此，他们对为拉斯克尔工作并不热心。",
	"If the characters refuse to back down after the second warning, Rasqel orders the bugbears to attack while he hangs back. They obey reluctantly, but if it becomes clear that their lives are in danger at any point, or if the characters offer 10 gp or more to each of them, they walk away and leave their boss to his fate. Rasqel, who is indebted to bad people, fights to the death. If the situation looks grim for the adventurers, Thetsis enters the fray.": "如果角色们在第二次警告后拒绝退缩，Rasqel就会命令虫子们进攻，而他则退缩。他们不情愿地服从，但如果他们的生命显然在任何时候都有危险，或者如果人物向他们每个人提供10戈比或更多，他们就走开，让他们的老板听天由命。负债累累的拉斯凯尔，会拼死一搏。如果情况看起来对冒险者来说很严峻，特西斯就会进入战场。",
	"The bugbears carry nothing of value, as Rasqel has not paid them in several days. The bandit carries 25 gp in his belt pouch.": "虫族没有携带任何有价值的东西，因为拉斯克尔已经好几天没有给他们钱了。匪徒的腰包里有25戈比。",
	"The \"Free-Market Lizardfolk\" encounter is just one of the many business opportunities that mark a long-running Acquisitions Incorporated campaign. Forward-thinking adventurers can make a deal with Thetsis and her tribe that might help them corner the market on {@item Potion of Water Breathing||potions of water breathing}. The terms of the deal are up to you, but it's best to start small. Once per month, the lizardfolk can meet the adventurers or their agents to sell them algae. As the characters start to hire franchise staff at the end of this episode, this is a perfect opportunity to set up how staff members can conduct franchise business with no direct involvement from the characters—at least not to start.": "自由市场蜥蜴人 \"的遭遇只是众多商机中的一个，它标志着一个长期运行的收购公司活动。有远见的冒险者可以与忒西丝和她的部落达成交易，这可能会帮助他们占领（%0%）的市场。交易的条款由你决定，但最好从小处开始。每月一次，蜥蜴人可以与冒险者或他们的代理人见面，向他们出售海藻。在本集结束时，人物开始雇用特许经营的工作人员，这是一个完美的机会，可以设置工作人员如何在没有人物直接参与的情况下开展特许经营业务--至少在开始时不是这样。",
	"These kinds of side ventures can easily expand to become adventures of their own. For example, one of the franchise NPCs handling the algae trade might fail to return from the Mere of Dead Men one day. The characters need to find out what happened if they want to keep employee morale from tanking—and to keep the business relationship with the lizardfolk intact. Choices must be made and consequences faced, which are the hallmarks of a great campaign.": "这些副业可以很容易地扩展成自己的冒险。例如，处理海藻贸易的一个特许NPC可能有一天没有从死人谷回来。如果他们想保持员工的士气不受影响，并保持与蜥蜴人的业务关系不受影响，他们就需要找出发生了什么。必须做出选择并面对后果，这是一个伟大活动的标志。",

	"If the characters aid her, Thetsis shares the story of her business arrangement with Rasqel. The bandit originally worked a fair deal with Thetsis and her lizardfolk tribe, whose members grow and harvest a nutrient-rich algae that is also a key ingredient for creating {@item Potion of Water Breathing||potions of water breathing}. After earning the tribe's trust, Rasqel altered the terms of the deal in stages, starting by offering less money in a \"slow market,\" then taking the algae with a promise to pay later, saying his cash flow was poor. When the lizardfolk began to balk at this arrangement, Rasqel threatened to send mercenaries to their home deep in the Mere of Dead Men, promising to destroy the tribe unless the lizardfolk worked for free. That threat was the cause of the altercation the characters witnessed.": "如果人物帮助她，Thetsis会分享她与Rasqel的商业安排的故事。这个强盗最初与忒西丝和她的蜥蜴人部落进行了公平的交易，他们的成员种植和收获一种营养丰富的海藻，这也是创造（%0%）的关键成分。在赢得该部落的信任后，拉斯克尔分阶段改变了交易条款，开始是在 \"市场不景气 \"的情况下提供更少的钱，然后拿走海藻，承诺以后再付款，说他的现金流很差。当蜥蜴人开始反对这种安排时，拉斯克尔威胁说要派雇佣兵到他们在死人谷深处的家，并承诺要摧毁这个部落，除非蜥蜴人免费工作。这一威胁是人物所目睹的争吵的原因。",
	"The characters might easily recognize that this situation is a prime business opportunity. If not, suggest that realization to a character with a merchant-related background, or one who succeeds on a DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) or Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check. Thetsis carries algae that she's willing to sell for 50 gp, but which is worth 100 gp in Waterdeep. More importantly, any character with herbalist or alchemist experience realizes that the algae can be mixed with other reagents costing 150 gp to make a {@item potion of water breathing}. Such a potion might fetch up to 500 gp in a city such as Waterdeep or Neverwinter.": "角色们可能很容易认识到这种情况是一个主要的商业机会。如果没有，建议由一个有商人背景的角色来实现，或者由一个成功通过DC10智力（{@skill Nature}）或智慧（{@skill Survival}）检查的人实现。忒西丝携带的海藻，她愿意以50戈比的价格出售，但在水底世界价值100戈比。更重要的是，任何有草药师或炼金术士经验的人物都会意识到，这些海藻可以和其他价值150戈比的试剂混合，制成{@item potion of water breathing}。这样的药水在水底城或永夜城这样的城市可能会卖到500金币。",
	"After turning east from the High Road onto the Triboar Trail, the characters' travel slows a bit. The High Road is frequently traveled by caravans, and so is better kept and easier to traverse. Triboar Trail, on the other hand, sees less frequent traffic and is less well maintained.": "从大路向东转入特里波尔小道后，人物的旅行速度稍有放缓。高路经常有大篷车经过，所以维护得比较好，比较容易穿越。另一方面，Triboar Trail的交通不那么频繁，维护得也不那么好。",
	"After a few hours' travel east, the adventurers come upon the following scene.": "经过几个小时的东行，冒险者们来到了以下场景。",
	"Sitting cross-legged in the middle of the road is an odd-looking figure wearing not a stitch of clothing. In one hand, he fiddles with a copper medallion etched with the image of a thin, tangled pair of antlers. He might be a beardless dwarf, or a short and pale half-orc, or a human with a gland condition. Either way, he doesn't look up as he speaks in a voice that sounds like a goat choking on sawdust.": "盘腿坐在路中央的是一个看起来很奇怪的人，他没有穿一针一线。他的一只手摆弄着一枚铜质奖章，上面刻着一对细长而纠结的鹿角的图案。他可能是一个没有胡子的侏儒，或者是一个矮小而苍白的半兽人，或者是一个有腺体疾病的人类。无论哪种情况，他都没有抬头，他说话的声音听起来像山羊被锯末噎住。",

	"This unfortunate wanderer is named Carkuss (N male human {@creature priest}). A character who has an appropriate background or who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Religion}) check recognizes the copper medallion as a holy symbol of Beshaba. Known as the Lady of Misfortune, Beshaba is Tymora's twin sister and archenemy. This character knows that Beshaba sends her favored souls out into the world as a focus for bad luck and calamity, and that dealing with a favored soul of the Lady of Misfortune is a risky situation. Interacting with such agents in any way can draw Beshaba's ire, with potentially catastrophic consequences.": "这个不幸的流浪者名叫卡库斯（N个男性人类（%0%））。有适当背景的人物或在DC15智力（（%1%））检查中成功的人物会认出这个铜牌是贝沙巴的圣物。被称为不幸的女士，贝沙巴是泰莫拉的孪生妹妹和死敌。这个角色知道贝沙巴将她的受宠灵魂送到世界上，作为厄运和灾难的焦点，而与不幸女士的受宠灵魂打交道是一种危险的情况。以任何方式与这种代理人互动都会引起贝沙巴的愤怒，并可能带来灾难性的后果。",
	"Now that Carkuss has crossed paths with the adventurers, they are stuck in the strands of his web of misfortune. To avoid the curse of Beshaba (see below), the characters must not harm Carkuss, they must not be overly kind to him, and they must correctly answer a riddle he asks. If successful on all three counts, each character earns a {@dice d10}. Once before the character's next long rest, they can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. In addition, by earning Carkuss's favor, the characters might see him when they need good fortune later, if you so decide.": "现在，卡库斯与冒险家们擦肩而过，他们被卡在他的不幸之网中。为了避免Beshaba的诅咒（见下文），人物不能伤害Carkuss，不能对他过于仁慈，而且必须正确回答他提出的谜语。如果这三点都成功了，每个角色都会获得一个（%0%）。在角色的下一次长时间休息前，他们可以掷骰子，并将掷出的数字加到一个能力检查、攻击卷或救赎动作中。此外，通过赢得卡库斯的青睐，如果你决定的话，在以后需要好运的时候，人物可能会见到他。",
	"If the characters fail at any of these three tasks, one or more of them (at your determination) earns the curse. If the characters attack Carkuss, he doesn't defend himself, hoping that they slay his miserable form so his soul can be free.": "如果人物在这三个任务中的任何一个失败，他们中的一个或多个（由你决定）就会受到诅咒。如果角色们攻击卡库斯，他不会为自己辩护，希望他们能杀死他的悲惨形态，这样他的灵魂就能得到自由。",
	"After initial interactions with the characters, Carkuss asks the following riddle:": "在与人物初步互动后，卡库斯问了以下谜语。",

	"To pass the curse, the victim can choose a living humanoid within 5 feet of it once per day, making a Charisma check contested by the target's Charisma check. If the cursed victim wins, the curse transfers to the new target. If unsuccessful in transferring the curse, the victim takes 5 ({@dice 1d10}) psychic damage.

	"The work of the gnome archmage Hoobur Gran'Shoop is a constant presence in episodes 2 and 3 of the adventure, even before his actual appearance toward the end of {@adventure episode 3|OoW|3}.

Most of its walls have collapsed in what appears to be a recent disaster, with traces of smoke still rising from piles of tumbled stone.": "在俯瞰小镇的一座小山上，耸立着一座古老的庄园，或者至少它曾经是一座古老的庄园。它的大部分墙壁都在最近的一场灾难中倒塌了，烟雾的痕迹仍然从翻滚的石头堆中升起。",

Just when things start to calm down in Phandalin, more murderous vagrants show up. They probably have something to do with what's happened to Tresendar Manor, and with the livestock that have started going missing! And it's only a matter of time before this all ends in misery and bloodshed, I promise you!\"": "舞台上一个身材魁梧、衣着光鲜的男性人类出乎意料地指着你们这群人喊道。\"你们看到了吗？这正是我的意思! 就在潘达林的事情开始平静下来的时候，更多的杀人的流浪者出现了。他们可能与特伦达庄园发生的事情有关，也与开始失踪的牲畜有关！\"。而这一切迟早会在痛苦和流血中结束，我向你保证！\"",
	"Phandalin was long run by an elected townmaster, until trouble with bandits some years ago saw the townmaster replaced by a council of three prominent citizens, elected every two years. However, the recent abdication of one councilor and the town's growing size have prompted the townsfolk to decide that it's time to expand the council to five persons, and to incorporate a mayorship to handle increasingly important decisions about Phandalin's future.": "长久以来，范达林由选举产生的镇长管理，直到几年前与强盗发生纠纷，镇长才被每两年选举一次的由三位杰出公民组成的理事会取代。然而，最近一位议员的退位和小镇规模的扩大促使镇民们决定是时候将议会扩大到五人，并设立市长职位来处理有关范达林未来的越来越重要的决定。",
	"Two people, both current councilors, are running for mayor. One is Harbin Wester, a male human with the integrity and unctuous personality of... well, a career politician.

	"Wester is the town's banker and a major landowner, so some consider his wealth and power to be ample justification for his greedy, conniving nature. More importantly, a number of monstrous and magical incidents in the area over many years have left Phandalin's citizens anxious for strong-sounding leadership. Even though adventurers solved many of the town's problems in the past, Wester has gained much popularity by convincing people that the town's troubles would have never surfaced if those well-armed wandering busybodies hadn't gotten involved in the first place. The banker has even gone so far as to suggest that adventurers might have orchestrated some of Phandalin's past woes for their own gain.": "威斯特是镇上的银行家和大地主，所以有些人认为他的财富和权力是他贪婪、纵容的充分理由。更重要的是，多年来该地区发生的一些怪物和魔法事件，让范达林的市民们对强大的领导力感到焦虑。尽管过去冒险家们解决了该镇的许多问题，但韦斯特通过说服人们相信，如果那些全副武装的流浪忙人没有参与进来，该镇的麻烦就不会浮现，从而获得了很多人气。这位银行家甚至暗示，冒险家可能为了自己的利益而策划了范达林过去的一些困境。",
	"Sildar Hallwinter isn't a great orator.

When that group arrived in town a few months ago, they spoke with Harbin Wester about acquiring the ruined Tresendar Manor, since the banker held the property's title.

But after a few days passed and no one from the manor came into town, Sildar Hallwinter braved the walk up the hill to investigate.": "几天前（也就是特许经营权付款给总部的同一天），镇民们听到了来自庄园的爆炸声，有几个人报告说看到了火焰的喷发，听到了战斗的骚动。没有人真正热衷于调查，想避免金驼团契给自己带来的任何麻烦。(冒险家，对吗？)但几天过去了，庄园里没有人进城，西尔达-霍尔温特勇敢地走到山上去调查。",
	"Where the manor once stood, he found only rubble, scorch marks, ruined construction, and bloodstains.

	"Just over a year ago, operatives of the Six came across one of the components of the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}—the {@item far gear|AI}. Quickly realizing the potential power in the component and the orrery it was a part of, they began to scour the Sword Coast for information regarding the artifact. A month ago, their intelligence-gathering resources turned up word that two Acquisitions Incorporated franchises—including the newly minted Phandalin franchise—had been scrutineering for lore about mysterious magic clockwork devices. Wanting to determine what Acquisitions Incorporated might know about the orrery, the leaders of the Six put a plan into motion.

So the Six hired a number of agents—including archmage Hoobur Gran'Shoop—to attack both franchises.": "六人组在范达林设立了一个代理人--迪奇-芬迪，他首先提出并现在管理着范达林的新币女寺。利用迪奇关于金龟子公司活动的情报，六人组确认该特许经营权拥有一个名为{@item timepiece of travel|AI}的轨道组件--而Acq公司总部对他们的发现至今一无所知。因此，六人帮雇佣了一些特工--包括大法师胡伯-格兰肖普--来攻击这两家专营店。",
	"Hoobur's forces snuck into Phandalin and razed Tresendar Manor to the ground. However, the Six operatives were unable to find the {@item timepiece of travel|AI}.

She took over that position after the former overseer (and third member of the town council) Halia Thornton left Phandalin \"to seek other opportunities.\" All the locals know that continual problems at nearby mines made Halia's job difficult, with little to no wealth coming into the exchange for months at a time. Unfortunately for Halia, the downturn in the mining industry was the least of her worries. The Manshoon sect of the Zhentarim saw an opportunity in Phandalin and had Halia killed. Sharna (LE female dwarf {@creature bandit captain}) is the sect's agent. She aims to revive mining in the area, with the goal of making Phandalin a haven for the rogue faction of the Zhentarim.": "莎尔娜-奎斯特隆是范达林矿工交易中心好斗的矮人监督员。她是在前监督员（也是镇议会的第三名成员）哈莉娅-桑顿离开范达林 \"寻求其他机会 \"后接手这个职位的。所有当地人都知道，附近的矿场不断出现的问题使哈莉娅的工作变得很困难，在几个月的时间里几乎没有财富进入交易所。对哈莉娅来说，不幸的是，采矿业的不景气是她最不担心的事。镇塔林的曼松教派在范达林看到了机会，并将哈莉娅杀害。莎尔娜（LE女侏儒（%0%））是该教派的代理人。她的目标是恢复该地区的采矿业，使范达林成为赞塔林的流氓派别的天堂。",
	"Sharna is thoroughly evil, but she's a fine actor. She has the economic interests of Phandalin at heart, but only because she hopes to have a prosperous town at her mercy when the needs of the Zhentarim become her focus. She ingratiates herself to the characters, hiring them to clear out monsters in the local area that threaten mining interests. She offers to partner up on business deals, sharing the profits of the mines if the characters invest their time or money in such operations. If the characters end up on the wrong side of Harbin Wester, she sides with them against the banker, concealing her goal of usurping his wealth and power. She encourages the characters to actively oppose Wester—or even to kill him if she thinks they might be amenable to the idea.": "莎尔娜是个彻头彻尾的恶魔，但她是个优秀的演员。她把范达林的经济利益放在心上，但只是因为她希望在镇塔林的需求成为她的重点时，能有一个繁荣的小镇任她摆布。她讨好这些人物，雇佣他们清除当地威胁采矿利益的怪物。她提出在商业交易中建立伙伴关系，如果角色在此类行动中投入时间或金钱，就可以分享矿场的利润。如果人物最终站在哈尔滨-维斯特的错误一边，她就会站在他们一边反对银行家，隐瞒她要篡夺他的财富和权力的目标。她鼓励人物积极反对韦斯特，如果她认为他们可能会接受这个想法，甚至可以杀死他。",
	"Sharna is a formidable combatant compared to most folk in Phandalin. She also keeps four bodyguards ({@creature Thug||thugs}) on hand to guard the exchange, travel to the mines, rough up \"uncooperative\" people, or do the dark deeds she needs done to meet her objectives.": "与范达林的大多数人相比，莎尔娜是个可怕的战斗员。她还留有四个保镖（（%0%）），负责看守交易所，前往矿区，粗暴对待 \"不合作 \"的人，或者做她需要做的黑暗勾当，以达到她的目的。",
	"Sildar (NG male human {@creature knight}) is a retired adventurer and Griffon Rider of Waterdeep. Some years ago, he worked in the employ of the Rockseeker family, who had hoped to reopen mines in the hills and mountains surrounding Phandalin. After nearly being killed in a goblin ambush while traveling to Phandalin for the first time, Sildar's faith in himself was shaken. The Rockseeker family moved on after their troubled dealings in the town, but Sildar stuck around.": "西尔达（NG男性人类（%0%））是一个退休的冒险家和水底世界的狮鹫骑士。几年前，他曾受雇于Rockseeker家族，该家族希望在范达林周围的丘陵和山脉重新开矿。在第一次前往范达林时，差点在地精的伏击中丧生，西尔达对自己的信心受到了动摇。Rockseeker家族在镇上的交易陷入困境后，就搬走了，但Sildar坚持在这里。",
	"Although he is getting on in years, Sildar still trains with his weapons and keeps himself in shape. He was one of the town's three councilors prior to (as he puts it), \"Halia Thornton leaving without even saying goodbye.\" By running for mayor against Harbin Wester, Sildar hopes to help Phandalin increase its prosperity—and to put that prosperity into everyone's pockets, not just Wester's. What he lacks in charisma, he makes up for in sincerity.": "虽然他年事已高，但西尔达仍在训练他的武器并保持自己的身材。在（正如他所说的）\"哈利亚-桑顿甚至不辞而别 \"之前，他是镇上的三名议员之一。通过与哈尔滨-维斯特竞选市长，西尔达希望帮助范达林增加繁荣--并将这种繁荣放入每个人的口袋，而不仅仅是维斯特的口袋。他在魅力方面的不足，在真诚方面得到了弥补。",
	"Sildar is a member of the Lords' Alliance, a group of allied leaders concerned with the security and prosperity of the North. As such, his goals are to bring stability and wealth to the region. He is brave and honest, but nearly losing his life years before caused him to doubt not only his martial skills but also his decision making. He could prove to be a valuable ally to the characters, especially if he's elected mayor. However, he might also frustrate them with his passivity and indecisiveness—or allow them to take advantage of those same qualities to wield great influence over him.": "西尔达是领主联盟的成员，这是一个关注北方安全和繁荣的联盟领导人团体。因此，他的目标是为该地区带来稳定和财富。他勇敢而诚实，但几年前差点失去生命，这使他不仅怀疑自己的武功，也怀疑自己的决策。他可能被证明是这些人物的一个有价值的盟友，特别是如果他被选为市长。然而，他的被动和优柔寡断也可能使他们感到沮丧，或者让他们利用这些品质对他产生巨大的影响。",
	"An Acquisitions Incorporated campaign works best when it's running on many levels at once. One of those levels is the business aspects of the characters' lives, with satire another obvious side of the campaign. But politics can be another driving force in an Acq Inc story, as can the satirical treatment of people in power.": "当收购公司的活动同时在许多层面上运行时，它的效果最好。其中一个层次是人物生活的商业方面，讽刺是运动的另一个明显的方面。但是，政治可以成为收购公司故事的另一个驱动力，对当权者的讽刺也可以。",
	"The political maneuverings taking place in Phandalin will inevitably have an impact on the characters and their franchise. Still, if the players aren't interested in the political aspect of the campaign story, don't worry about it. Wester is elected mayor, the players can play nice with him to get what they want, and the story moves forward. But if the characters care about who becomes mayor, they have plenty of opportunity to influence the outcome.": "在潘达林发生的政治演习将不可避免地对人物和他们的特许权产生影响。尽管如此，如果玩家对竞选故事中的政治方面不感兴趣，也不用担心这个问题。威斯特被选为市长，玩家可以和他打好关系以获得他们想要的东西，故事就会向前发展。但如果角色们关心谁成为市长，他们就有很多机会来影响结果。",
	"Sildar Hallwinter cares about the good of the town but is wishy-washy. His lack of charisma hurts his chances for election. But a clever group of adventurers working behind the scenes might be just what Hallwinter needs to energize his campaign. On the other hand, Harbin Wester controls much of the wealth in Phandalin, including Tresendar Manor. As such, helping Wester get elected—or at least not being too obvious about opposing him—can put the characters on his good side. Even if Wester loses the election, his power and wealth mean that the characters will be interacting with him—and dealing with his ability to make their lives easier or harder—whether they want to or not.": "西尔达-霍尔温特关心本镇的利益，但却畏首畏尾。他缺乏魅力，损害了他的选举机会。但是，一群聪明的冒险家在幕后工作，可能正是霍尔温特需要的，以激发他的竞选。另一方面，哈尔滨-维斯特控制着潘达林的大部分财富，包括特伦达庄园。因此，帮助维斯特当选--或者至少不要太明显地反对他--可以让这些人物站在他的一边。即使维斯特在选举中失利，他的权力和财富也意味着人物将与他互动，并与他的能力打交道，使他们的生活变得更容易或更困难，无论他们是否愿意。",
	"Another possibility is that one of the characters could run for office as a last-minute wild-card candidate. A stranger wandering into Phandalin is unlikely to gain the trust of enough citizens to win the race, and the need to stick around town and run things will eventually get in the way of the characters venturing all over the North being heroic. But don't discount the narrative possibilities involved in the characters embracing the political side of the story even more wholeheartedly than you expect them to.": "另一种可能性是，其中一个角色可以作为最后一刻的野生候选人参加竞选。一个流浪到范达林的陌生人不太可能获得足够多的公民的信任来赢得竞选，而且坚持在镇上管理事情的需要最终会妨碍人物在北方各地冒险的英雄主义。但是，不要低估人物比你期望的更全心全意地拥抱政治方面所涉及的叙事可能性。",
	"Sister Garaele (CG female elf {@creature priest}) was a zealous and enthusiastic servant in Phandalin's Shrine of Luck before Ditch Fundi, \"the competition,\" arrived in town a month ago. Now, she is downright frenetic. She proselytizes for Tymora in the streets, in taverns, and in people's homes. Garaele is well known for haranguing the folk of Phandalin, claiming that the misfortune of previous years has been due to a lack of devotion to Tymora. Despite this, most locals like the priest, and are likely to help her if she's in trouble.": "Garaele修女（CG女精灵（%0%））在一个月前 \"竞争对手 \"迪奇-芬迪来到镇上之前，是范达林幸运神殿的一名热心而热情的仆人。现在，她简直是狂热的。她在街上、酒馆里和人们的家里为泰莫拉传教。Garaele以骚扰范达林的民众而闻名，声称前几年的不幸是由于缺乏对Tymora的奉献。尽管如此，大多数当地人都喜欢这位牧师，如果她有麻烦，他们可能会帮助她。",
	"Garaele was once an agent of the Harpers, though she has recently broken ties with that group of agents opposing the abuse of power. Since then, she has taken significant donations from Dran Enterprises, whose agents asked her to keep an eye on the members of the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose and any other Acquisitions Incorporated operatives in Phandalin. Garaele is happy to pass this information along in exchange for Dran Enterprises' payments to the temple, and she asks no questions about that organization's long-term goals for the town. She is a good person, however, so she won't knowingly allow harm to befall others. She is helpful to anyone willing to offer wealth, goods, or services to her shrine.": "Garaele曾经是哈珀斯的一名特工，尽管她最近与那群反对滥用权力的特工断了联系。从那时起，她接受了德兰企业的大量捐赠，德兰企业的代理人要求她密切关注金驼团的成员和任何其他收购公司在潘达林的行动者。Garaele很乐意将这些信息传递出去，以换取德兰企业对寺庙的付款，而且她对该组织在该镇的长期目标不闻不问。不过，她是个好人，所以她不会故意让别人受到伤害。她对任何愿意为她的神殿提供财富、货物或服务的人都很有帮助。",
	"Though not exactly people and no longer in Phandalin, a neutral {@creature ogre} named Stuuzant is another potential source of information for the characters. She was one of the operatives used by the Six in the attack on Tresendar Manor, smashing her way through the site's walls. When the attack was over, the ogre wandered away. However, she decided to stick around the area to enjoy her proximity to lots of tasty livestock, even as she keeps her distance from anyone who might pester her.": "虽然不完全是人，也不在潘达林，但一个名叫斯图赞特的中立者（%0%）是人物的另一个潜在信息来源。她是六人帮在攻击特伦达庄园时使用的行动者之一，她砸开了该地的墙壁。攻击结束后，这个食人魔游荡着离开了。然而，她决定留在这个地区，享受她接近许多美味的牲畜的乐趣，即使她与任何可能纠缠她的人保持距离。",
	"In the days since the destruction of the manor, farmers and herders on the outskirts of Phandalin have reported seeing giant-sized footprints, both humanoid and canine, as well as missing animals. No one has spotted Stuuzant, as the ogre has good instincts for avoiding trouble. She keeps moving, hiding until the time is right to strike. When she attacks livestock, she does so when no one can see her, and she takes only what she needs to survive.": "在庄园被毁后的几天里，范达林郊区的农民和牧民都报告说看到了巨大的脚印，包括人形和犬形的，还有失踪的动物。没有人发现Stuuzant，因为这个食人魔有避免麻烦的良好本能。她一直在移动，躲藏起来，直到时机成熟才出手。当她攻击牲畜时，她会在没有人看到她的时候进行，而且她只拿她需要的东西来生存。",
	"Characters might be asked to look into the missing livestock, or they can do so on their own to get on the good side of the locals. Investigating the disappearances might be used to angle for something the characters want or need, such as supplies, a lower price on Tresendar Manor, citizens favoring one mayoral candidate over another, or whatever else you can think of.": "角色可能被要求去调查失踪的牲畜，或者他们可以自己去调查，以获得当地人的好感。调查失踪事件可以用来争取人物想要或需要的东西，比如物资、特伦达庄园的低价、市民对某个市长候选人的偏爱，或者其他你能想到的东西。",
	"Tracking down and defeating Stuuzant is no easy task, however. She is friends with a pair of {@creature Dire Wolf||dire wolves}, and is mostly successful at covering her tracks after her raids. The ogre also has yet to establish a den in the area, so she rarely stays in one place for more than a day.": "然而，追踪并击败斯图赞特并不是一件容易的事。她和一对{@creature Dire Wolf||dire wolves}的朋友，在她的突袭之后，大多能成功地掩盖她的踪迹。这个食人魔还没有在这个地区建立起一个巢穴，所以她很少在一个地方停留超过一天的时间。",
	"If the characters locate her, Stuuzant speaks Common quite well, uses smarter tactics than a typical ogre, and tries to bargain with the characters if it looks like they might defeat her. If questioned, she tells the story of being hired to attack the manor. A goblin in hooded robes paid her to help break into the estate and smash everything in sight. Stuuzant never saw the goblin's face, and knows nothing about the Six (which was never mentioned to her or any of the other hirelings).": "如果角色们找到她，Stuuzant的普通话说得很好，使用比一般食人魔更聪明的战术，如果角色们看起来有可能打败她，她会试图与角色们讨价还价。如果被问起，她会讲述自己被雇佣来攻击庄园的故事。一个穿着连帽长袍的妖精付钱给她，让她帮助闯入庄园，打碎眼前的一切。斯图赞从未见过那个妖精的脸，也对六人组一无所知（她和其他雇工都没有提到过）。",
	"Savvy characters might convince Stuuzant to take a position in their franchise, with the ogre making a great sentry or bodyguard. However, the townspeople might need assurances to accept such a creature living so close to their town.": "精明的角色可能会说服Stuuzant在他们的特许经营中占据一席之地，让食人魔成为一个伟大的哨兵或保镖。然而，镇民们可能需要得到保证才能接受这样的生物离他们的小镇如此之近。",
	"Stuuzant carries the 50 gp she was paid to help attack the manor.": "斯图赞带着她得到的50金币，帮助攻击庄园。",
	"As they explore Phandalin—and eventually set up their franchise in the town—the characters can engage with many of the town's businesses, whether as patrons or potential partners. The most prominent of the town's locations (as well as a few additional NPCs) are detailed in this section. You can come up with details for additional locations and NPCs based on the needs and desires of your players.": "在探索范达林的过程中--最终在镇上建立了自己的特许经营权--人物可以与镇上的许多企业接触，无论是作为顾客还是潜在的合作伙伴。本节中详细介绍了该镇最突出的地点（以及一些额外的NPC）。你可以根据玩家的需要和愿望，为其他地点和NPC提供细节。",
	"The apple trees of Edermath Orchard surround a small group of buildings on the edge of town. The smell of fruit is strong around the orchard year round, with the apples grown and picked here processed throughout the winter into juice, cider, and other products.": "埃德马斯果园的苹果树围绕着城镇边缘的一小群建筑。果园周围一年四季都弥漫着浓浓的果香，这里种植和采摘的苹果在整个冬季都被加工成果汁、苹果酒和其他产品。",
	"Daran Edermath (NG male elf {@creature scout}) established the orchard many years before. A former adventurer and one of the oldest people in Phandalin, he remains aloof from town politics and focuses his interest on the traveling merchants and food-related businesses in Phandalin that buy his wares. Daran employs down-and-out miners to do odd jobs and help during harvest, so he's popular among the town's working folk.": "达兰-艾德玛斯（NG男精灵（%0%））在多年前建立了这个果园。他曾是一名冒险家，也是范达林最年长的人之一，他对镇上的政治不闻不问，他的兴趣集中在范达林的旅行商人和与食品有关的企业上，这些企业购买他的产品。达兰雇用落魄的矿工做零工，并在收割时帮忙，因此他在镇上的劳动人民中很受欢迎。",
	"Daran's half-elf daughter Bertice went missing the day before the destruction at Tresendar Manor, and he is beginning to fear for her. Most folk in town know that Bertice recently took up with a human miner named Grovet, who is also missing. If the characters met the couple on the road (see the \"{@area Random Encounters|07a|x}\" table earlier in this episode), they can allay at least some of Daran's fears for his daughter's safety.": "达兰的半精灵女儿贝尔蒂丝在特伦达庄园被毁的前一天失踪了，他开始为她担心。镇上的大多数人都知道贝尔蒂丝最近和一个叫格罗维特的人类矿工在一起，他也失踪了。如果人物在路上遇到这对夫妇（见本集前面的\"{@area Random Encounters|07a|x} \"表），他们至少可以减轻达兰对女儿安全的担忧。",
	"Earning Daran's full trust is a long-term proposition, and the characters must prove themselves beyond reproach in any dealings with the orchardist. If they do, however, the elf proves a valuable ally. He has more resources and power in town than his humble orchard might suggest. And as a member of the Order of the Gauntlet—an association of vigilant adventurers that seeks to overthrow evil—Edermath has the ear of powerful people up and down the Sword Coast.": "赢得达兰的完全信任是一个长期的命题，人物必须在与果园主的任何交易中证明自己无可指责。然而，如果他们做到了，这个精灵就会成为一个有价值的盟友。他在镇上拥有的资源和权力比他那简陋的果园所显示的要多。作为高塔骑士团的成员--一个由警觉的冒险家组成的协会，旨在推翻邪恶--埃德马斯拥有剑海岸上上下下有权势的人的耳朵。",
	"The Lionshield Coster is a trading post and competitor to the Phandalin Miners' Exchange. A weathered sign hanging above the front door depicts a blue lion painted on a wooden shield. Linene Graywind (NG female human {@creature commoner}) manages the store, which is one of a chain of mercantile outposts spread up and down the Sword Coast. Mother to Minghee (see \"{@area People of Phandalin|097|x}\" above), Linene works tirelessly to keep the coster operational through good times and bad.": "狮盾科斯特是一个贸易站，也是范达林矿工交易所的竞争者。大门上方挂着一块风化了的牌子，上面画着一只画在木质盾牌上的蓝色雄狮。Linene Graywind（NG女性人类（%0%））管理着这家商店，它是分布在剑海岸上下的连锁商行前哨之一。作为明熙（见上文\"{@area People of Phandalin|097|x}\"）的母亲，琳恩不知疲倦地工作，使商店在顺境和逆境中都能正常运营。",
	"Most of the goods in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} can be purchased here. Linene can special order items for delivery in a few days (with a deposit, of course). However, she doesn't buy, procure, or sell morally questionable goods.": "{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中的大部分商品都可以在这里购买。Linene可以特别订购商品，在几天内交货（当然要付定金）。然而，她不购买、采购或出售有道德问题的商品。",
	"This trading post once acted as the central hub for mining activity in the area, as well as the authority for maintaining public records. A two-story building, the exchange bears a newly painted sign depicting two crossed pickaxes above a lump of gold. The first story is where business is conducted, while the second story contains living quarters.": "这个贸易站曾经是该地区采矿活动的中心枢纽，也是维护公共记录的机构。这是一座两层楼的建筑，交易所上有一个新画的标志，上面描绘着两把交叉的镐头，上面是一坨金子。第一层是开展业务的地方，而第二层则是生活区。",
	"As with the Lionshield Coster, most of the goods available in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} can be purchased here.

	"Until a month ago, this temple to Tymora was the only shrine in town. With the Temple of the Coinmaiden (see below) newly established, Sister Garaele, the local priestess, works harder each day to keep the attention of the faithful of Phandalin.

	"This single-story tavern's better days have seen better days. Its weathered sign probably depicts a prone giant, but whatever paint or carvings once adorned the sign have been all but worn away. Inside, the place shows the same lack of care. It's dirty, ill kept, and in need of a thorough cleaning. Or burning.": "这家单层小酒馆的好日子已经过去了。其风化的招牌可能描绘了一个俯卧的巨人，但不管招牌上曾经装饰过什么油漆或雕刻，都已经被磨掉了。在内部，这个地方也显示出同样的缺乏关怀。它很脏，保管不善，需要彻底清洁。或者烧掉。",
	"The place is normally occupied by dwarf and human miners, either back from a stretch in the mines or waiting for a mine to reopen. They are not overtly hostile unless provoked, but it doesn't take much to provoke this unhappy lot. The owner and barkeep is Grista Kettlecopp (N female dwarf {@creature commoner}). Surly to the point of rudeness, she tries to run her business her own way and stay out of the political and personal affairs of other townsfolk.": "这个地方通常由矮人和人类矿工占据，他们或是从矿场回来，或是在等待矿场重新开放。除非受到挑衅，否则他们不会有明显的敌意，但要挑衅这群不开心的人并不需要太多。店主兼酒吧老板是克里斯塔-凯特尔科普（N个女矮人（%0%））。她很粗鲁，试图以自己的方式经营自己的生意，不参与其他镇民的政治和个人事务。",
	"The miners that frequent the Sleeping Giant are a rough lot, and could become a competent and formidable force if stirred up and pointed at a target. Currently, Sharna at the Miner's Exchange has their trust (see \"{@area People of Phandalin|097|x}\"), mostly for her assurances that the mines will soon be more prosperous than ever. If Sharna discovers that the characters are interfering with her and the Zhentarim's plans, she need only tell the miners that the characters are standing in the way of their gainful employment to inspire them to use their pickaxes for something other than mining. On the other hand, characters who earn the miners' good will can end up with numerous allies in Phandalin.": "经常光顾 \"沉睡的巨人 \"的矿工是一群粗野的人，如果他们被煽动起来并指向一个目标，就会成为一支有能力的、强大的力量。目前，矿工交易所的莎尔娜得到了他们的信任（见\"{@area People of Phandalin|097|x}\"），主要是因为她保证矿场很快会比以前更繁荣。如果莎尔娜发现这些角色干扰了她和Zhentarim的计划，她只需要告诉矿工，这些角色阻碍了他们有收益的工作，就可以激励他们用镐头做采矿以外的事情。另一方面，赢得矿工好感的角色最终会在范达林拥有众多盟友。",
	"This building contains an open area with a forge and several anvils, but the rest of the structure is closed off. Maza Fieldsalder (N female human {@creature commoner}) took over the smithy a year ago, after the death of her master, Alger Frakk. As the master smith's apprentice, the powerfully built young woman earned her new position through hard work and talent, and she is well liked among the other townsfolk.": "这座建筑有一个开放的区域，里面有一个锻炉和几个铁砧，但其余的结构是封闭的。Maza Fieldsalder（N个女性人类（%0%））一年前在她的主人Alger Frakk死后接管了这个铁匠铺。作为铁匠师傅的学徒，这位身材强壮的年轻女子通过努力工作和天赋赢得了她的新职位，她在其他镇民中很受欢迎。",

	"The Stonehill Inn is one of the largest buildings in town. The business is run by Trilena and Toblen Stonehill, assisted by their twelve-year-old son, Pip.

The six-bedroom complex is tidy and clean, the table fare is good, and the company is pleasant.": "斯通希尔旅馆是镇上最大的建筑之一。生意由特里莱纳和托布伦-斯通希尔经营，由他们12岁的儿子皮普协助。(所有的人都是人类（%0%）。斯通希尔夫妇自从五年多前建立客栈以来，已经舒适地度过了范达林的多变时期。这座有六间卧室的建筑整洁干净，桌子上的食物很好，公司也很愉快。",
	"The Stonehills are unwitting soldiers in the war for power in Phandalin. Although they own and operate their business, they owe a small amount of money to Harbin Wester. The banker wants to take their business, and he keeps an eye out for any opportunity to gain the necessary leverage. He might use the characters to lean on the Stonehills if they end up owing him favors. Alternatively, if the characters befriend the Stonehills, they might become staunch allies in the family's attempts to keep Wester's hands off their business.": "斯通希尔家族是范达林权力争夺战中不知情的士兵。虽然他们拥有并经营着自己的生意，但他们却欠着哈尔滨维斯特的一小笔钱。银行家想夺取他们的生意，他一直在留意任何可以获得必要筹码的机会。他可能会利用这些人物来靠拢Stonehills家族，如果他们最终欠他人情的话。另外，如果这些人物与斯通希尔家族交好，他们可能会成为该家族试图阻止韦斯特染指他们生意的坚定盟友。",
	"Many fantasy campaigns either ignore questions of law or utilize benevolent authoritarian figures to oversee social and economic justice—the wise monarch, the enlightened town council, the Masked Lords, and so forth. This method means that the law is stable. Higher authorities can be consulted on matters requiring arbitration, with concrete edicts handed down to make the line between right and wrong—in a civil sense, at least—crystal clear.": "许多幻想活动要么忽视法律问题，要么利用仁慈的专制人物来监督社会和经济的公正性--明智的君主、开明的镇议会、蒙面领主等等。这种方法意味着法律是稳定的。在需要仲裁的问题上，可以咨询更高的当局，通过具体的法令，使对与错之间的界限--至少在民事意义上--变得清晰。",
	"In Phandalin (as with many of the other locations in this adventure), the situation is not that simple. No king or council owns the lands of or around the town. Eminent domain is neither implied nor accepted. In most of the smaller settlements along the Sword Coast, the person with power is the individual who takes and holds that power. Locales still have authorities and laws, but the person who can kill everyone else—or pay someone to do so—is the one who truly rules.": "在潘达林（就像这次冒险中的许多其他地点一样），情况并不那么简单。没有国王或议会拥有该镇的或周围的土地。征用权既不隐含也不被接受。在剑海岸的大多数小型定居点中，拥有权力的人是采取并持有这种权力的个人。各地仍有当局和法律，但能杀死其他人的人--或付钱给别人这样做的人--才是真正的统治者。",
	"In Phandalin, Harbin Wester is that person. Even if he loses the mayoral election, his monetary resources far outstrip those of anyone else in the town, leaving him in a position of strong economic control. However, part of Wester's power derives from subtlety. He is wary enough to watch out for anyone with the ability to effectively oppose him, and savvy enough to make sure that such people never have any reason to oppose him. As such, when the characters clean out Tresendar Manor and attempt to use it as the base for their new franchise, a potential for social and economic conflict arises.": "在范达林，哈尔滨-维斯特就是这样的人。即使他在市长选举中失利，他的货币资源也远远超过了镇上的其他人，使他处于强大的经济控制地位。然而，韦斯特的权力部分来自于微妙的手段。他有足够的警惕性，注意任何有能力有效反对他的人，也有足够的智慧，确保这些人永远没有任何理由反对他。因此，当这些人物清理了特伦达庄园并试图将其作为新特许经营权的基地时，社会和经济冲突的可能性就产生了。",
	"Wester holds the mortgage on the manor. The legal entity that was the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose was the signatory to that mortgage, and unfortunately for Acquisitions Incorporated, the mortgage is now in arrears. The characters can work a deal to take over those payments, but the terms are steep. Fortunately, after the manor is cleared, Head Office is willing to negotiate for the manor's deed. (See the \"{@area Conclusion|117|x}\" section of this episode for more information.) This leaves Harbin Wester bitter, as he recognizes that having the favor of Acq Inc backing them up gives the characters more potential power in Phandalin than he likes.": "维斯特持有该庄园的抵押权。金色独角兽团契的法律实体是该抵押贷款的签字人，不幸的是，对于收购公司来说，该抵押贷款现在已经拖欠了。角色们可以达成协议来接管这些款项，但条件很苛刻。幸运的是，在庄园被清空后，总部愿意为庄园的契约进行谈判。(详见本集的\"{@area Conclusion|117|x} \"部分）。这让哈尔滨威斯特苦不堪言，因为他认识到，有Acq公司的青睐为他们撑腰，让这些人物在范达林的潜在权力比他喜欢的更大。",
	"As the rest of the campaign plays out, keep track of how Wester might try to take advantage of the characters and their deal. What if operatives of Dran Enterprises or representatives of the Six come to him? More importantly, if the characters directly oppose Wester and bring him low, what happens if a worse power steps in to take his place? The options are limitless. Do what challenges and entertains your players most!": "在接下来的活动中，要注意韦斯特可能会如何利用这些人物和他们的交易。如果德兰企业的特工或六人帮的代表来找他怎么办？更重要的是，如果角色们直接反对维斯特，使他的地位下降，那么如果有更坏的势力介入，取代他的位置，会发生什么？选择是无限的。做到挑战和娱乐你的玩家最多!",
	"Half a year past, another general store in Phandalin called Barthen's Provisions went out of business. The building was purchased a month ago for the church of Waukeen by an unknown benefactor, and quickly renovated with all the fineries necessary to draw the attention of the goddess of wealth. The gnome Ditch Fundi oversaw the temple's construction and dedication, and she now runs it in Waukeen's name. (In truth, the benefactor who built the temple is the Six, and Ditch Fundi is their agent. See her entry in \"{@area People of Phandalin|097|x}\" for more information.)": "半年过去了，范达林的另一家名为 \"Barthen's Provisions \"的杂货店倒闭了。一个月前，一位不知名的施主为沃肯教堂买下了这座建筑，并迅速装修了所有必要的装饰品，以吸引财富女神的注意。地精迪奇-芬迪（Ditch Fundi）监督了寺庙的建造和奉献，她现在以沃肯的名义管理它。(事实上，建造寺庙的恩人是六人帮，而迪奇-芬迪是他们的代理人。更多信息见她在\"{@area People of Phandalin|097|x} \"中的条目）。",
	"This one-story hall is the closest thing the people of Phandalin have to a government building. Long used as the town council's meeting room and the townmaster's hall before that, it is set to be expanded to include the new mayor's office after the election. As the two remaining members of the town council, Sildar Hallwinter and Harbin Wester currently share office space here.": "这个一层楼的大厅是范达林人民最接近政府大楼的地方。长期以来，它被用作镇议会的会议室和之前的镇长大厅，在选举之后，它将被扩大到包括新镇长的办公室。作为镇议会剩下的两名成员，西尔达-霍尔温特和哈尔滨-维斯特目前在这里共享办公空间。",
	"After the characters have met some of the locals and heard what's known about the events at Tresendar Manor and the disappearance of the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose, they can investigate the fallen manor and the dungeons beneath it. Once a small but elegant estate, the ruined building sits upon a hill overlooking Phandalin. Years of neglect had already done considerable damage to the structure, only some of which the Golden Mongoose adventurers had restored. But the recent attacks undid all that work, pulling most of the above-ground structure down.": "在人物认识了一些当地人，并听说了关于特伦达庄园事件和金驼团员失踪的情况后，他们可以调查这个倒塌的庄园和它下面的地牢。这座破败的建筑曾经是一个小而优雅的庄园，坐落在俯瞰潘达林的山丘上。多年的忽视已经对该建筑造成了相当大的破坏，只有部分被金枪鱼冒险家们修复了。但最近的攻击使所有的工作都付诸东流，将大部分的地面结构拉倒了。",
	"\"The Orrery of the Wanderer\" makes use of an adventure trope as old as D&D itself—working up a totally high-powered artifact, then dropping it into the hands of low-level characters just to see what happens. The orrery and its six components are presented in {@book appendix D|AI|6}, and the powers of these relics are significant. But the fact that the orrery is an artifact in a some-assembly-required state gives you a lot of latitude in determining how you dole those powers out.": "\"流浪者的金字塔 \"使用了一个与D&D本身一样古老的冒险套路--制作一个完全高能的神器，然后把它丢到低级别的角色手中，看看会发生什么。神器和它的六个部件以（%0%）的形式出现，这些遗物的力量很重要。但事实上，神器是一个处于需要组装状态的神器，这给了你很大的自由度来决定如何分配这些力量。",
	"The orrery's components are set up so that their magic gets weird while the orrery is in pieces. At your determination, that magic might act in unpredictable ways, not recharge as often as normal, or add random effects to keep the characters on their toes. One aspect of this unpredictability comes into play in the adventure when the tiefling Talanatha uses the {@item timepiece of travel|AI} to escape from the attack on Tresendar Manor, only to have the timepiece stay behind (see later on in this episode for details).": "箭塔的组件被设置成在箭塔被破坏的时候，它们的魔法会变得很奇怪。在你的决定下，这些魔法可能会以不可预测的方式发挥作用，不象正常情况下那样频繁地充能，或者增加随机效果以使人物保持警惕。这种不可预测性的一个方面在冒险中出现了，当铁皮人塔拉纳塔使用{@item timepiece of travel|AI}从对特伦达庄园的攻击中逃脱时，计时器却被留下来了（详见本集后面）。",
	"By making sure the characters understand the unpredictable nature of the components' magic, you give them good incentive to be cautious about using them. And if the power of the components threatens to derail parts of the adventure (for example, if the characters plan on using the {@item timepiece of travel|AI} to teleport everywhere and find every secret location in the scenario), feel free to have the power of individual components mysteriously fail until they are all installed in the orrery housing once more.": "通过确保角色了解组件魔法的不可预测性，你给了他们很好的激励来谨慎使用它们。如果组件的力量有可能破坏冒险的某些部分（例如，如果角色们计划使用（%0%）到处传送并找到剧情中的每一个秘密地点），可以自由地让个别组件的力量神秘地失效，直到它们再次全部安装在神龛上。",
	"When the characters reach the top of the hill and get a closer look at the ruins of Tresendar Manor, read the following:": "当人物到达山顶，仔细观察特伦达庄园的废墟时，请阅读以下内容。",
	"Many of the crumbled walls of the manor show signs of having been recently rebuilt, but even that newer stonework has been toppled and smashed, coating everything in the area with a thick layer of dust. Temporary structures seemingly set up to aid the reconstruction have been badly damaged by force and fire, though a couple of wooden buildings still stand amid the destruction.": "庄园的许多坍塌的墙壁显示出最近被重建的迹象，但即使是那些较新的石制品也被推倒和砸碎，给该地区的一切都涂上了一层厚厚的灰尘。似乎是为了帮助重建而建立的临时建筑已经被武力和火灾严重破坏，尽管有几座木制建筑仍然矗立在破坏之中。",
	"As the characters draw closer, a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana} or {@skill Investigation}) check reveals that the fire damage isn't natural, and that magic was likely involved. The same successful check allows a character to intuit that the stonework was not smashed by weapons or tools, suggesting that a creature of great size and strength took part in the destruction.": "随着人物的接近，成功的DC15智力（（%0%）或（%1%））检查显示，火灾的伤害不是自然的，很可能是魔法的作用。同样成功的检查可以让角色直觉到这些石头不是被武器或工具砸碎的，这表明有一个巨大的体型和力量的生物参与了这次破坏。",
	"Any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check can hear the jackals in the central courtyard of the manor before the group approaches that area.": "任何通过DC10智慧（（%0%））检查成功的角色都可以在队伍接近该区域之前听到庄园中央院子里的豺狼。",
	"As the characters enter the ruined courtyard of Tresendar Manor, they find they are not alone.": "当人物进入特伦达庄园的废墟院子时，他们发现自己并不孤单。",
	"Numerous brown-and-gray jackals prowl the ruins. Some gnaw on bones, while others sniff and dig at a pile of stones at the center of the manor courtyard. In response to your approach, the nearest jackals turn toward you and snarl.": "许多棕色和灰色的豺狼在废墟上游荡。有的在啃骨头，有的则在庄园院子中央的石头堆上嗅着、挖着。为了回应你的接近，最近的豺狼人转向你并咆哮。",
	"A {@creature jackalwere} called Hamebi leads a pack of ten {@creature Jackal||jackals} searching the ruins for survivors and treasure. Any character who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check after the fight starts notices that one of the jackals (Hamebi in animal form) wears a satchel slung across its back.": "一个叫哈米比的{@creature jackalwere}带领着10个{@creature Jackal||jackals}族群在废墟中搜寻幸存者和宝藏。任何在战斗开始后通过DC10智慧({@skill Perception})检查成功的角色都会注意到其中一只豺狼人（动物形态的哈梅比）背上背着一个挎包。",
	"Hamebi stays in jackal form, using her Sleep Gaze on the toughest-looking adventurer. If that target falls {@condition unconscious}, three jackals quickly swarm the character. Hamebi flees if it looks like the characters might defeat her. She orders her jackals to cover her retreat, but they follow her lead the next round. She surrenders if she faces death with no way to escape.": "哈米比保持豺狼形态，对看起来最难缠的冒险者使用她的睡眠凝视。如果这个目标倒下了（%0%），三只豺狼就会迅速涌向这个角色。如果这些角色看起来可能会打败她，哈米比就会逃跑。她命令她的豺狼人掩护她撤退，但他们在下一回合会跟随她的步伐。如果她面临死亡且无路可逃，她就会投降。",
	"Hamebi works for the Six, although she doesn't know it. If captured, she can relate that a short, cloaked humanoid came to her in Neverwinter Wood two days ago, hiring her to bring her pack of jackals to Phandalin and search the ruins for bodies. This was Splugoth, unconvinced by Hoobur Gran'Shoop that the orrery component known to be held by the Golden Mongoose company is gone from the area; see the note in {@area area 12|10b|x} of the Tresendar Manor dungeons. Splugoth wanted creatures with keen scent to make another attempt at locating any franchise dead.": "哈梅比为六人帮工作，虽然她不知道。如果被抓到，她可以说两天前在永冬森林有一个矮小的、隐身的人形生物来找她，雇佣她带着她的豺狼人队伍去范达林，在废墟中搜寻尸体。这是Splugoth，他不相信Hoobur Gran'Shoop的说法，即已知由Golden Mongoose公司持有的ORRERY组件已从该地区消失；见Tresendar Manor地牢的{@area area 12|10b|x}的说明。斯普鲁戈斯希望有敏锐嗅觉的生物再次尝试寻找任何特许经营的死者。",
	"Hamebi's satchel holds 50 gp and a {@item potion of climbing}.": "哈梅比的挎包里有50个金币和一个（%0%）。",
	"With the jackalwere and her pack defeated or driven off, the characters can search the grounds. If they search in the area where the jackals were digging, see \"Survivor\" below. If they explore the remains of the buildings on the grounds, a successful DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check reveals the following:": "豺狼人和它的族群被打败或被赶走后，角色们就可以搜索场地。如果他们在豺狼人挖掘的地方进行搜索，请看下面的 \"幸存者\"。如果他们探索场地上的建筑遗迹，成功通过DC10智力（（%0%））检查，可以发现以下情况。",
	"Newly built wooden structures were struck by fire. Two of those still stand, but most have been burned or smashed to the ground.": "新建的木质结构被大火击中。其中有两座还在，但大多数已经被烧毁或砸成了废墟。",

	"Older humanoid remains were the source of the jackals' meal. However, no intact corpses can be found among the rubble.": "较早的人形遗骸是豺狼人的食物来源。然而，在废墟中找不到完整的尸体。",
	"Additionally, the walls of the still-standing structures bear a mark in chalk—a double-\"D\" insignia. This is the sigil of Dran Enterprises. As adventurers familiar with the operations of Acquisitions Incorporated, all the characters recognize the mark of Acq Inc's greatest rival organization. (The marks have been scribed by the archmage Hoobur Gran'Shoop, who is charged by the Six with ensuring that Dran Enterprises takes the blame for the attack on the Acq Inc franchise at Phandalin. More on Hoobur will be revealed in {@adventure episode 3|OoW|3}.)": "此外，仍然存在的结构的墙壁上有一个白垩的标记--双 \"D \"标志。这就是德兰企业的标志。作为熟悉收购公司运作的冒险者，所有人物都能认出Acq公司最大的对手组织的标记。(这些标记是由大法师胡伯-格兰肖普（Hoobur Gran'Shoop）刻画的，他被六人组责成确保德兰企业为在范达林（Phandalin）对Acq公司特许经营权的攻击承担责任。关于胡伯的更多信息将在{@adventure episode 3|OoW|3}中披露。）",

	"As the characters search the area where the jackals were digging, a low, pained moaning rises from beneath the rubble. Carefully pulling away the rocks reveals a half-orc buried under smashed and still-smoldering masonry. This is {@creature Gildha Duhn|OoW}, majordomo of the Company of the Golden Mongoose franchise. She is starving, dehydrated, and addled. {@creature Gildha Duhn|OoW|Gildha} uses the {@creature acolyte} stat block with these racial traits:": "当角色们搜索豺狼人挖掘的地方时，瓦砾下面传来了低沉而痛苦的呻吟声。小心翼翼地拉开石块，发现一个半兽人被埋在被砸碎和仍在燃烧的砖石下。这是{@creature Gildha Duhn|OoW}，金蒙哥公司的大老板。她饥肠辘辘，脱水，而且昏昏沉沉。{@creature Gildha Duhn|OoW|Gildha}使用{@creature acolyte}的状态块与这些种族特征。",

	"She speaks Common and Orc.": "她会说普通话和兽人语。",
	"Gildha repeatedly mutters something in a low voice, but she has something in her mouth that makes it impossible to understand her. Oddly, that something is a complex clockwork device, which Gildha stuck in her mouth to keep out of enemy hands during the attack. If the device is removed, the characters hear her repeatedly say, \"They came for it... they came for the timepiece...\"": "Gildha反复用低沉的声音咕哝着什么，但她嘴里有东西，让人无法理解她的意思。奇怪的是，那个东西是一个复杂的发条装置，Gildha把它塞在嘴里，以防止在攻击期间被敌人抓住。如果这个装置被移开，角色们就会听到她反复说：\"他们是来找它的......他们是来找这个钟表的......\"",
	"If given magical healing or allowed to sleep for an hour after being given food and water, Gildha regains her senses. She tells the characters that she worked for the Acquisitions Incorporated franchise in Phandalin, and that while working on their ongoing renovation of Tresendar Manor, the franchisees were attacked at night by unknown assailants. Gildha knows few details of the attack and heard little of the aftermath. Though she saw one of her group escape by teleporting away, she isn't sure what happened to the others. Falling rubble knocked her down, then buried her. Surviving on nothing but rainwater and her half-orc endurance, Gildha has been in and out of consciousness since the attack.": "如果给她以魔法治疗或在给她食物和水后让她睡上一小时，吉尔达就会恢复理智。她告诉这些人物，她在范达林的收购公司（Acquisitions Incorporated）工作，当他们正在对特伦达庄园进行改造时，加盟商在夜间遭到了不明身份的袭击者的攻击。Gildha对袭击的细节知之甚少，对袭击后的情况也听得不多。虽然她看到她的小组中的一个人通过传送逃走了，但她不确定其他人发生了什么。坠落的瓦砾将她击倒，然后埋葬了她。除了雨水和她的半兽人耐力外，吉尔德哈在袭击发生后一直处于意识模糊状态。",
	"When the characters examine the somewhat sodden device that was in Gildha's mouth, they can see that its design and etched glyphs clearly mark it as part of the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}.": "当人物检查吉尔达嘴里的那件有些发霉的装置时，他们可以看到它的设计和蚀刻的字形清楚地标志着它是（%0%）的一部分。",
	"{@creature Gildha Duhn|OoW|Gildha} knows a little about the device, which she calls the {@item timepiece of travel|AI}. The Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose found the relic six months ago in the possession of an evil adventuring band, who claimed to have taken it not long before from a tomb haunted by undead. After careful scrutineering and research, the Golden Mongoose adventurers learned that the timepiece had magical powers dedicated to navigation and teleportation, and speculated that it was just one piece of a larger and more potent magic device.": "{@creature Gildha Duhn|OoW|Gildha}对这个装置有一些了解，她称之为{@item timepiece of travel|AI}。6个月前，金獴团契在一个邪恶的冒险团手中发现了这个遗物，他们声称不久前从一个被亡灵困扰的坟墓里拿走了它。经过仔细的检查和研究，金驼队的冒险家们了解到这个计时器具有专门用于导航和传送的神奇力量，并推测它只是一个更大、更有力的魔法装置的一个部件。",
	"During the attack, Gildha saw one of the Golden Mongoose adventurers—a female tiefling paladin occultant named Talanatha Three-Coins—activate the {@item timepiece of travel|AI} and teleport away. For reasons unknown, the timepiece stayed behind (see the \"{@area Level Inappropriate|0bf|x}\" sidebar). Gildha grabbed the relic, but has no idea where Talanatha went.": "在攻击过程中，Gildha看到一个金艋舺的冒险者--一个名叫Talanatha Three-Coins的女铁弗林圣骑士神秘主义者--激活了{@item timepiece of travel|AI}并传送离开。由于未知的原因，计时器被留下来了（见\"{@area Level Inappropriate|0bf|x} \"侧边栏）。吉尔达抓住了这个遗物，但不知道塔拉纳塔去了哪里。",
	"Gildha also tells the characters that she saw some of the attackers heading into a small cellar beneath the manor, consisting of storage areas and a spring-fed cistern. She knows that the manor features subterranean areas more extensive than the cellar, but the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose had yet to do a thorough search of those areas. (As a result, Gildha doesn't know about the secret door that leads to the dungeon.)": "Gildha还告诉角色们，她看到一些袭击者进入了庄园下面的一个小地窖，里面有储藏区和一个有泉水的蓄水池。她知道庄园的地下区域比地窖更广阔，但金驼团契还没有对这些区域进行彻底搜查。(因此，吉尔德哈不知道通往地窖的秘密门）。",
	"Although the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose didn't find the secret door leading into the hidden basement beneath the manor, the agents of the Six did. They then made extensive use of the dungeon before departing. Map 2.2 shows the layout of the dungeons beneath the manor.": "虽然金驼团没有找到通往庄园下面隐藏的地下室的暗门，但六人组的特工却找到了。然后他们在离开之前大量使用了这个地牢。地图2.2显示了庄园下面的地牢的布局。",

	"Most doors in the dungeon are wooden, and are closed and unlocked. If a door is locked, it takes a successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools to open it. A locked door can also be smashed open with a successful DC 15 Strength check.": "地牢里的大多数门都是木制的，而且是关着的，也可以不上锁。如果一扇门被锁住了，需要用盗贼的工具成功地进行DC10灵巧检查才能打开它。被锁住的门也可以通过成功的DC15力量检查来砸开。",

Additionally, one carries a {@item Potion of Necrotic Resistance||potion of resistance (necrotic)} and the other carries a {@item spell scroll} of {@spell cause fear|XGE} and a {@item spell scroll} of {@spell blindness/deafness} (if those weren't used in the fight).": "每个妖精有25个金币和一个{@i potion of healing}。此外，一个带着（1%），另一个带着（3%）的（2%）和（5%）的（4%）（如果这些没有在战斗中使用）。",
	"The characters can also take the acid spray gun, and they find a sack holding ten {@item Acid (vial)|PHB|vials of acid} near the hobgoblins.": "人物也可以拿酸液喷枪，他们在霍布林斯附近找到一个装着10个（%0%）的麻袋。",
	"Any NPCs the characters rescued from the dungeon or left in the ruins hide during the combat. Those characters emerge from hiding only when the situation is safe.": "角色从地牢中救出的或留在废墟中的任何NPC都会在战斗中隐藏起来。这些角色只有在情况安全时才会从藏身处出现。",
	"If questioned, any surviving hobgoblins proudly admit that they work for Dran Enterprises, and that they were hired to clean up the manor site and prepare it for annexation. The hobgoblins claim (truthfully) to know nothing about what happened to reduce the manor to ruins, or the fate of the missing tiefling from the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose. They have no connection to the Dran Enterprises insignia scribed among the manor ruins. They can't say for certain that Dran Enterprises didn't have some involvement with the incident, but if so, it had nothing to do with them.": "如果被询问，任何幸存的地精都会自豪地承认他们为德兰企业工作，他们被雇来清理庄园的场地，并为吞并做准备。妖精们声称（如实地）对将庄园变成废墟的事情一无所知，也不知道金驼团契中失踪的铁弗林的命运。他们与庄园废墟中刻画的德兰企业徽章没有关系。他们不能确定德兰企业与这一事件没有关系，但如果是这样，也与他们没有关系。",
	"With their adventures in Phandalin complete, the characters attain 3rd level! More importantly, after clearing the ruins and dungeon of Tresendar Manor, they are able to officially launch their own Acquisitions Incorporated franchise! The characters need to send a message to {@creature Omin Dran|AI} to report their findings. Not long after, Omin contacts them using magic, congratulating them on their success, telling them to rest up, and informing them that a representative of Acquisitions Incorporated will arrive soon to deliver paperwork and any other information a new franchise needs.": "随着他们在潘达林的冒险完成，人物达到了第三级！更重要的是，在清理了特伦达庄园的废墟和地牢后，他们能够正式启动自己的收购公司特许经营权。更重要的是，在清理了特伦达庄园的废墟和地牢后，他们可以正式启动自己的收购公司专营权了 角色们需要给{@creature Omin Dran|AI}发送消息，报告他们的发现。不久之后，奥明用魔法联系了他们，祝贺他们的成功，告诉他们要好好休息，并告知他们收购公司的代表很快就会到达，送来文书和新的特许经营权所需的任何其他信息。",
	"Sure enough, well-known Acquisitions Incorporated operative Viari (see {@book appendix A|AI|3}) arrives the next day to deliver the documents and supplies, and to officially christen the new Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. He has each of the characters sign a contract crammed full of legalese and double-talk. Any character who reads the document and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check can decipher the jargon to learn the following, or Viari can explain the highlights:": "果然，著名的收购公司特工Viari（见{@book appendix A|AI|3}）第二天就来了，送来了文件和物资，并为新的收购公司特许经营权正式洗牌。他让每个角色都签署了一份充满法律术语和双关语的合同。任何读过文件的角色，如果在DC15智力检查中获得成功，就可以破译这些专业术语，了解以下内容，或者维阿利可以解释其中的重点。",

	"As part of that fee, Acquisitions Incorporated handles parts of the franchise's operations, including location procurement, staff management, and other benefits.": "作为该费用的一部分，Acquisitions Incorporated处理特许经营的部分业务，包括地点采购、员工管理和其他福利。",
	"The monthly fee paid to Acquisitions Incorporated by a starter franchise covers the salaries of a majordomo, a skilled hireling, and two untrained hirelings. Franchisees must pay any hirelings employed beyond this number.": "初始特许经营商向收购公司支付的月费包括一名主事人、一名熟练雇工和两名未经训练的雇工的工资。特许经营商必须支付任何超过这个数字的雇佣人员。",
	"The franchise is licensed to operate in Phandalin and within 5 miles of the town, and is protected against interference in that area from other franchises.": "该特许经营权被许可在范达林和该镇5英里范围内经营，并在该地区受到保护，免受其他特许经营权的干扰。",
	"Acquisitions Incorporated will deal with acquiring the rights to Tresendar Manor from Harbin Wester, as they did for the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose.": "收购公司将处理从哈尔滨维斯特收购特伦达尔庄园的权利，就像他们为金驼团契所做的那样。",
	"\"{@book Franchise Advancement|AI|1|Franchise Advancement}\" in chapter 2 has detailed explanations of all these benefits and more.": "第二章中的\"{@book Franchise Advancement|AI|1|Franchise Advancement} \"详细解释了所有这些好处，以及更多。",
	"One of the franchise's first hires might be right in front of them already. {@creature Gildha Duhn|OoW}, former majordomo for the Company of the Golden Mongoose, is grieving her lost employers and anxious to put her life back together. With previous experience running a franchise (and no fault in that franchise's destruction), she makes an excellent choice for majordomo, and suggests that role for herself if the characters don't ask her. The remaining episodes in this adventure assume that the characters selected {@creature Gildha Duhn|OoW} as their franchise's majordomo. If they chose another NPC to fill that role, simply adjust the text throughout the adventure accordingly.": "特许经营的第一批雇员之一可能已经在他们面前了。{@creature Gildha Duhn|OoW}，前金驼公司的主事人，正在为她失去的雇主感到悲伤，并急于把她的生活重新安排好。她以前有经营特许经营权的经验（而且在特许经营权的破坏中没有过错），她是一个很好的选择，如果角色不要求她的话，她建议自己担任这个角色。在这次冒险中的其余情节中，假设人物选择了{@creature Gildha Duhn|OoW}作为他们的特许经营权的主人公。如果他们选择了另一个NPC来充当这个角色，只需在整个冒险过程中对文本进行相应的调整。",
	"With the contract signed, the ruins of Tresendar Manor become the franchise's starter headquarters! One of the benefits of Head Office negotiating with Harbin Wester for the lease to the manor is that the company can drive a much harder bargain than the characters would ever be able to strike. This beneficial deal might have hidden downsides, though, as the thin profit margins of the lease become a point of ongoing conflict between the characters and the corrupt banker.": "随着合同的签署，特伦达庄园的废墟成为特许经营的启动总部 总公司与哈尔滨维斯特公司就庄园的租约进行谈判的好处之一是，该公司可以比角色们更努力地进行讨价还价。不过，这种有利的交易可能有隐藏的弊端，因为租约的薄利多销成为人物与腐败的银行家之间持续冲突的一个点。",
	"At the signing of the franchise agreement, each character picks one of the positions detailed in \"{@book Company Positions|AI|1|Company Positions}\" in chapter 2. When they do so, Viari hands out any special position gear and instructs the characters in how best to fulfill their roles. Chapter 2 has more details on these positions, the benefits they confer, and what they mean to the franchise. Hopefully, the players have already considered what positions are the best fit for their characters and for the franchise as a whole, but if not, give them time. Make sure it's clear what each position entails and what franchise duties a character with a given position is expected to perform.": "在签署特许经营协议时，每个角色都会选择第二章\"{@book Company Positions|AI|1|Company Positions} \"中详述的一个职位。当他们这样做时，Viari会发放任何特殊的职位装备，并指导人物如何最好地履行他们的角色。第二章有更多关于这些职位的细节，它们所带来的好处，以及它们对特许经营的意义。希望玩家们已经考虑过哪些职位最适合他们的角色和整个特许经营权，但如果没有，请给他们时间。要确保清楚每个职位需要什么，以及拥有特定职位的角色应该履行哪些特许经营职责。",
	"In addition to the characters' positions, the franchise majordomo can also select a company position if desired. This is especially useful if there's a key position that none of the players wants to take, or if the party size is small.": "除了人物的职位外，如果需要的话，特许经营商也可以选择一个公司的职位。如果有一个关键职位没有人愿意担任，或者党员人数不多，这就特别有用。",
	"The process of rebuilding Tresendar Manor will take some time, and as proud franchise owners, the characters need to be around to pitch in and make sure nothing goes awry. At the same time, their newly awarded territory is ripe for exploration and interaction with potential customers and business partners. As the characters take stock of their situation, they can engage in downtime activities and undertake some of the franchise tasks that operate alongside the downtime rules.": "重建特伦达庄园的过程将需要一些时间，作为自豪的特许经营权所有者，这些人物需要在身边投其所好，确保不会出现任何意外。同时，他们新获得的领土已经成熟，可以与潜在的客户和商业伙伴进行探索和互动。随着人物对自己情况的评估，他们可以参与停工活动，并承担一些与停工规则同时运作的特许经营任务。",
	"All the activities mentioned in this section are introduced or talked about in the \"{@book Franchise Tasks and Downtime|AI|1|Franchise Tasks and Downtime}\" section in chapter 2. That section notes which books existing activities can be found in.": "本节中提到的所有活动都在第二章的\"{@book Franchise Tasks and Downtime|AI|1|Franchise Tasks and Downtime} \"部分进行了介绍或谈论。该部分指出了现有活动可以在哪些书中找到。",
	"As the characters spend time establishing their new commercial home turf, the explore territory downtime activity can yield up all kinds of new opportunities and connections. Interesting NPCs might be revealed on a walkabout in the woods around Phandalin, or the characters might locate stands of prime timber or abandoned mines still holding valuable ore. Such resources can become part of the franchise's ongoing revenue stream.": "当人物花时间建立他们新的商业主场时，探索领土的闲暇活动可以产生各种新的机会和联系。有趣的NPC可能会在范达林周围的树林中被发现，或者人物可能会找到优质木材或废弃的矿井，这些矿井仍有宝贵的矿石。这些资源可以成为特许经营权的持续收入来源的一部分。",
	"Commercial connections forged with NPCs could also be formalized and refined. The lizardfolk of the Mere of Dead Men and the Splintfig sisters are just two of the potential business partnerships from this episode, whether the characters engage those NPCs themselves or allocate members of their brand-new staff for those tasks.": "与NPC建立的商业联系也可以被正式化和完善。死人谷的蜥蜴人和Splintfig姐妹只是这一集中的两个潜在的商业伙伴关系，无论人物是自己与这些NPC打交道，还是分配他们全新的员工去完成这些任务。",
	"In Phandalin, the characters might use the marketeering activity to set up a partnership with Linene Graywind at the Lionshield Coster, or with Sharna Quirstiron of the Phandalin Miner's Exchange—whether they know Sharna's true allegiances or not. Depending on how well the characters are getting along with Harbin Wester, the shady business practice activity might let them get more dirt on the banker, or gain his favor by going after some of his rivals.": "在潘达林，角色们可能会利用市场活动与狮盾成本商的Linene Graywind建立合作关系，或者与潘达林矿工交易所的Sharna Quirstiron建立合作关系--无论他们是否知道Sharna的真实忠诚。根据人物与哈尔滨-维斯特相处的情况，这种不光彩的商业行为可能会让他们得到更多关于银行家的污点，或者通过对他的一些竞争对手下手来获得他的青睐。",
	"Shady business practices might be an even bigger part of the characters' plans for their franchise. Any number of dodgy NPCs in town might be interested in partnering with characters who want to skirt the law. Smuggling ore without paying taxes, skimming from the coffers of either temple, running illegal gambling at the Sleeping Giant—any of these activities could net a nice profit with relatively limited risk.": "阴暗的商业行为可能是这些人物的特许经营计划中更重要的一部分。镇上任何一个狡猾的NPC都可能对与那些想规避法律的角色合作感兴趣。走私矿石而不交税，从神庙的库房里偷钱，在沉睡的巨人那里进行非法赌博--这些活动中的任何一个都可以在相对有限的风险下获得丰厚的利润。",
	"If the characters have nobler aspirations for their franchise—or if they're savvy enough to want to hide their franchise's ignoble aspirations from the get-go—a philanthropic enterprise can go a long way toward shoring up the party's reputation. A franchise could work to support the existing charity efforts of either of the local temples, or the characters could create their own fund for out-of-work miners. Doing so makes acquiring ongoing concessions or information from townsfolk much easier, but puts the characters in the bad graces of Sharna Quirstiron at the Miner's Exchange.": "如果人物对他们的特许经营权有更高的追求--或者如果他们足够精明，想从一开始就隐藏他们特许经营权的不光彩的追求--那么慈善事业可以在很大程度上巩固党的声誉。特许经营权可以支持当地寺庙的现有慈善工作，或者这些人物可以为失业的矿工创建自己的基金。这样做可以更容易地从镇民那里获得持续的优惠或信息，但也会使角色们受到矿工交易所的莎尔娜-奎斯特隆的恶感。",
	"Even as the characters are setting up their new franchise, you'll want to work in hooks to lead them to the next stage in the adventure. Based on what they've learned during this episode, the characters are aware that the only other survivor of the attack on the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose was the tiefling paladin occultant Talanatha Three-Coins. Clearly the best source of information regarding the attack on the manor, Talanatha used the {@item timepiece of travel|AI} to teleport away, but no one knows where she went.": "即使在人物建立新的特许经营权时，你也要在钩子上下功夫，引导他们进入冒险的下一个阶段。根据他们在这一集里所了解到的情况，角色们知道，在对金驼团契的袭击中唯一的其他幸存者是铁弗林圣骑士神秘主义者塔拉纳塔-三钱。显然，塔拉纳塔是有关庄园遇袭的最佳信息来源，她用（%0%）传送走了，但没有人知道她去了哪里。",
	"Many of the locals had interactions with Talanatha in the three months that the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose was around Phandalin, and characters can use the schmoozing or carousing downtime activities to learn more about the tiefling. In particular, a number of the regulars at the Sleeping Giant remember drinking with Talanatha. She often grumbled about whether the Company of the Golden Mongoose was the best fit for her, and talked about a good friend named Wizzy who worked for another Acquisitions Incorporated franchise. The details on Wizzy's franchise are vague, but Talanatha spoke of her friend having \"an awesome headquarters up the coast.\"": "在金驼队在潘达林附近的三个月里，许多当地人都与塔拉纳塔有过交往，角色们可以利用闲暇时间的攀谈或狂欢活动来了解这个铁皮人。特别是，沉睡的巨人的一些常客都记得和塔拉纳塔一起喝酒。她经常埋怨金驼公司是否最适合她，并谈到一个叫威兹的好朋友，他在另一家收购公司的专营店工作。关于Wizzy的特许经营权的细节很模糊，但塔拉纳塔谈到她的朋友在 \"海岸上有一个很棒的总部\"。",
	"Characters can also spend downtime investigating the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI} and the {@item timepiece of travel|AI}, using either the scrutineering or research activities. In addition to revealing more details of the orrery as you see fit (see {@book appendix D|AI|6}), such investigation could reveal that the last place the timepiece teleported someone to was a location on the Sea of Swords, north of Neverwinter but south of Luskan. Scrutineering or inquiries through Head Office turns up information on an Acquisitions Incorporated franchise based in that area—the Order of the Stout Half-Pint, which has its headquarters in an old lighthouse along a stretch of coast known locally as Silent Sound.": "角色也可以用停工期来调查{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}和{@item timepiece of travel|AI}，使用检查或研究活动。除了揭示更多你认为合适的钟表细节外（见{@book appendix D|AI|6}），这样的调查可以发现计时器最后传送到的地方是剑海的一个地方，在永冬的北部，但在卢斯坎的南部。通过总部的调查或查询，发现了一个收购公司在该地区的特许经营权的信息--Stout Half-Pint骑士团，其总部设在当地称为Silent Sound的海岸线上的一座旧灯塔里。",
	"Whatever clues the characters obtain regarding Talanatha's likely destination, have those hints play out over the full length of the downtime rather than rushing to advance to the next episode. The players should get used to how big a part downtime and franchise activities play in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign.": "无论角色们获得了关于Talanatha可能的目的地的什么线索，都要让这些暗示在整个停工期内发挥出来，而不是急于推进到下一集。玩家应该习惯于在收购公司的活动中，停工期和特许经营活动所占的比重有多大。",
	"Before the next phase of the adventure, make sure the characters have their franchise and business affairs in order. They should know who their franchise employees are, giving those staff members detailed instructions about what to do while the characters are away. This sort of planning is a common theme in any Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, so establish this precedent early.": "在冒险的下一阶段之前，要确保角色们把他们的特许经营权和商业事务安排妥当。他们应该知道谁是他们的特许经营员工，给这些员工以详细的指示，告诉他们在人物不在的时候应该做什么。这种计划是任何收购公司活动的共同主题，所以要尽早建立这种先例。",
	"Speculating that Talanatha Three-Coins might have fled to the Silent Sound lighthouse headquarters of another Acquisitions Incorporated franchise, the characters might attempt to make contact with that franchise, either on their own or through Head Office. However, any such attempts yield no response. At some point, Omin Dran contacts the characters if they don't contact him first. He's worried about what the lack of contact with the Order of the Stout Half-Pint might mean, and he wants the characters to investigate.": "角色们猜测塔拉纳塔-三钱可能已经逃到了另一家收购公司的寂静之声灯塔总部，他们可能会试图与该公司取得联系，无论是自己还是通过总部。然而，任何这样的尝试都没有得到回应。在某些时候，如果他们不先联系Omin Dran，他就会联系这些角色。他很担心与 \"半品脱啤酒团 \"缺乏联系意味着什么，他希望角色们能进行调查。",
	"The presence of Dran Enterprises operatives in Phandalin is troubling for Omin—especially if the Dran Enterprises hobgoblins were killed without the characters questioning them, leading to the assumption that the organization was behind the initial attack. If the characters aren't suitably intrigued by the orrery and its newly discovered component, that can be another thing that Omin charges them with investigating. Armed with a solid guess that Talanatha fled to the lighthouse, the characters prepare to head north!": "德兰企业的特工出现在范达林，这让奥明感到不安--特别是如果德兰企业的霍布林在人物没有询问他们的情况下被杀，就会导致假设该组织是最初袭击的幕后黑手。如果角色们没有适当地对桔梗和它新发现的组件产生兴趣，那就可以成为Omin责成他们调查的另一件事。带着对塔拉纳塔逃往灯塔的可靠猜测，角色们准备向北出发",
	"In this episode, the characters (newly enfranchised and now 3rd level) travel to the Silent Sound lighthouse to search for Talanatha, the tiefling paladin occultant of the Fellowship of the Golden Mongoose. On the way, Omin Dran contacts them with a request. He wants them to stop in Neverwinter to check on a cache of Acquisitions Incorporated treasure being stored there. However, the doppelganger who hid the cache has been arrested and is about to be executed. Even if the characters save her, retrieving the treasure where it's been hidden in the House of Knowledge—Oghma's temple in Neverwinter—will take more time and effort than Omin predicted.": "在这一集里，角色们（刚被授予权利，现在是3级）前往寂静之音灯塔，寻找金驼团契的铁皮人圣骑士神秘主义者塔拉纳塔。在路上，奥明-德兰联系了他们，提出了一个请求。他希望他们在永夜城停留，检查存放在那里的收购公司的宝藏。然而，藏匿宝藏的二重身已被逮捕，即将被处决。即使角色们救了她，要找回藏在知识之家--奥格玛在永冬的寺庙里的宝藏，也要比奥明预想的花费更多的时间和精力。",
	"Leaving Neverwinter, the characters head north in the direction of Silent Sound. But even as the lighthouse comes into view, they spot a small boat under attack by creatures from the deep. If they rescue the crew, the characters might find a business opportunity that involves partaking in a little mutiny against a ruthless captain.": "离开永无止境，人物向北朝寂静湾的方向走去。但就在灯塔出现的时候，他们发现一艘小船受到了来自深海的生物的攻击。如果他们能救出船员，人物可能会发现一个商机，那就是参与对抗无情的船长的小叛乱。",
	"At the lighthouse, the characters confirm that the Acquisitions Incorporated franchise headquartered there—the Order of the Stout Half-Pint—was attacked, and that most of its members have been killed. Moving up through the different levels of the lighthouse tower, the franchisees find more and more evidence that the same spellcaster whose creations they've previously faced has wrought havoc there. That spellcaster, Hoobur Gran'Shoop, is found working in a grisly laboratory beneath the tower, to which the adventurers gain entrance through the lighthouse's magic lens. That laboratory is only part of the lighthouse's secret basement, though, and the characters engage in some dangerous and lucrative dungeoneering after dealing with—or doing a deal with—Hoobur.": "在灯塔上，这些人物确认总部设在那里的收购公司的特许经营权--坚固的半品脱骑士团--受到了攻击，而且其大部分成员都被杀害了。通过灯塔的不同楼层，加盟商们发现越来越多的证据表明，他们之前面对的那个施法者在这里造成了巨大的破坏。这个施法者名叫胡伯-格兰肖普（Hoobur Gran'Shoop），被发现在塔下的一个可怕的实验室里工作，冒险者们通过灯塔的魔镜进入了这个实验室。不过，这个实验室只是灯塔秘密地下室的一部分，在与胡伯打交道或与胡伯做交易后，角色们参与了一些危险而有利可图的地下活动。",
	"With the threats in the lighthouse dispensed with, the characters learn that its franchise members had also recently collected one of the clockwork components of the {@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}. They also have evidence in hand pointing to the involvement of Dran Enterprises in the attack on the lighthouse, building on the sighting of Dran Enterprises operatives in Phandalin. But what does Dran Enterprises want with the orrery? And which band of plucky franchisees will be tasked with finding out?": "随着灯塔中的威胁被消除，角色们了解到其特许经营成员最近也收集了{@item Orrery of the Wanderer|AI}的一个发条部件。他们还掌握了证据，表明德兰企业参与了对灯塔的袭击，这是在范达林看到德兰企业人员的基础上形成的。但是，德兰企业想要什么？哪一队勇敢的加盟者将负责找出答案？",
	"With the franchise headquarters in Phandalin secured and the rebuilding of Tresendar Manor underway, the adventurers have a clear path ahead of them to the Silent Sound lighthouse. However, you get to decide how complicated the journey turns out to be.": "随着位于范达林的特许经营总部的安全和特伦达庄园的重建工作的进行，冒险家们有了一条通往寂静之音灯塔的明确道路。然而，你可以决定这段旅程会有多复杂。",
	"One big question is whether the characters should travel overland up the Sword Coast, or whether you want to let them teleport directly to Silent Sound using the {@item timepiece of travel|AI}. Either option is fine. With an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign often involving access to crazy magic, don't be afraid to let the characters make use of it. But there are options for holding back on the magic of the orrery and its components if you want to (see the \"{@area Level Inappropriate|0bf|x}\" sidebar in episode 2), and an overland journey has its own rewards, in the form of additional encounters and side treks that can help build a fun story.": "一个大问题是，人物是否应该从陆路走上剑海岸，或者你想让他们用（%0%）直接传送到静音。两种选择都可以。在收购公司的活动中，往往涉及到对疯狂魔法的使用，不要害怕让人物利用它。但是，如果你想的话，也可以选择不使用火炉的魔法和它的组件（见第2集的\"{@area Level Inappropriate|0bf|x} \"侧边栏），而且陆路旅行也有它自己的回报，以额外的遭遇和侧面跋涉的形式，可以帮助建立一个有趣的故事。",
	"This episode provides one side trek that sees the characters stop in Neverwinter on their way to the lighthouse, which can be made use of no matter what the party's method of travel. Additionally, if the characters are traveling overland, you can introduce random encounters along the road using the same method and table from {@area episode 2|078|x}. If you roll a result that makes no sense, roll again or create an encounter of your own.": "这一集提供了一个侧面的跋涉，看到人物在前往灯塔的路上在永夜城停留，无论队伍的旅行方式如何，都可以利用这个侧面。此外，如果人物是陆路旅行，你可以用同样的方法和表格（%0%）在路上引入随机遭遇。如果你掷出的结果没有意义，就再掷一次或者自己创造一个遭遇。",
	"Before the characters leave for the lighthouse, or while they are on the High Road traveling toward Neverwinter, Omin Dran makes contact with a \"small favor.\" Neverwinter is located on the High Road on the way to the Silent Sound lighthouse, so is an easy stop for the party to make.": "在人物出发去灯塔之前，或者当他们在前往永夜城的大路上时，奥明-德兰联系到了一个 \"小忙\"。永温特位于通往寂静之音灯塔的公路上，所以对他们来说是一个很容易到达的地方。",
	"Head Office assignments of this sort can become common in an Acquisitions Incorporated campaign, especially as the characters' reputation as troubleshooters grows. You can use such side treks as useful support for a franchise's main mission, or as an inconvenient interruption.": "在收购公司的活动中，这种总部的任务很常见，特别是当角色作为麻烦解决者的声誉越来越高时。你可以把这种副业作为对特许经营的主要任务的有益支持，或者作为一种不方便的干扰。",

Her name is Oppal DeScart, and you can usually find her in a tavern in the Blacklake District known as the Stable Quiver. She's a shapeshifter, so I can't say for sure what she'll look like when you locate her. You can suss her out with the passphrase \"That's a big hen house,\" and she should reply with \"Only to a small fox.\" When you locate her, tell her that it's safe to \"Move the cargo along the Platinum Road.\" And that's it. She'll give you the treasure to get out of Neverwinter safely. The whole affair should take a few hours, and then you can be on your way. You can get the goods to me when you return.\"": "\"是的，所以我需要你为我做一点额外的工作。这应该不会太累人。我在永夜城有一个联系人，他获得了一批宝藏。她的名字叫Oppal DeScart，你通常可以在黑湖区的一家名为Stable Quiver的酒馆中找到她。她是个变身人，所以我不能确定你找到她时她会是什么样子。你可以用 \"那是个大鸡舍 \"来打探她，她应该回答 \"只对小狐狸\"。当你找到她时，告诉她，\"沿着白金路移动货物 \"是安全的。就这样了。她会给你宝藏，让你安全离开永夜城。整个事件应该只需要几个小时，然后你就可以上路了。你回来后可以把货物交给我。\"",
	"Omin's primary concern is to have Oppal's treasure secured and removed from the city without drawing the attention of Neverwinter's tax collectors. He tells the characters that the treasure is small but its container is warded, and that they should be prepared to store and carry it without looking in it. Omin isn't keen to get into additional details, though, suggesting that the less the characters know, the better. (This is another potentially entertaining hallmark of assignments handed down from Head Office, and plausible deniability is one of the core competencies of any successful Acquisitions Incorporated franchise.)": "奥明最关心的是如何保护奥帕尔的财宝，并在不引起永夜的收税员注意的情况下将其运出城市。他告诉角色们，宝藏不大，但它的容器有防护措施，他们应该准备好储存和携带它而不看里面。但奥明并不热衷于了解更多的细节，他认为人物知道的越少越好。(这是总部下达的任务的另一个潜在的娱乐性特征，而合理的推诿是任何成功的收购公司特许经营的核心竞争力之一）。",
	"Either on their way to Neverwinter or while in the city, the characters might want to dig around a bit to find out more about what exactly they're getting into. They might also assign a franchise task to their staff back in Phandalin, getting them to use scrutineering or research to find out more.": "无论是在前往永夜城的路上，还是在永夜城中，角色们都可能想四处调查一下，以了解他们到底在搞什么。他们也可能会给他们在范达林的员工分配一个特许任务，让他们利用审查或研究来了解更多。",

Part of the metropolis is magnificent, with breathtaking architecture, marvelous spires, and opulent decorations. And amid that beauty is a terrible scar caused by the eruption of Mount Hotenow years before. Citizens are still rebuilding from that disaster, largely thanks to the extra taxes Lord Neverember levies against the wealthy. The city's poorer residents benefit from the rebuilding work, and live in hope that the artisans and builders in the City of Skilled Hands can turn their home into the Jewel of the North once again.": "当人物到达永夜城时，他们发现自己身处一个分裂的城市--实际上是分裂的。大都会的一部分是宏伟的，有令人叹为观止的建筑，奇妙的尖顶，和华丽的装饰。而在这一美景中，多年前霍特诺山的喷发造成了一个可怕的伤疤。市民们仍在从那场灾难中重建，这主要归功于Neverember勋爵对富人征收的额外税收。城市的贫困居民从重建工作中受益，他们生活在希望之中，希望巧手之城的工匠和建筑商能把他们的家园再次变成北方的宝石。",
