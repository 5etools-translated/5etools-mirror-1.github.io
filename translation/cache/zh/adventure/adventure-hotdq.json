	"{@i Tyranny of Dragons} tells an epic story spanning two adventures, {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen} and {@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}—the two tales contained within this collection. Both adventures are introduced here, outlining their backgrounds, plots, and fundamental ties, followed by details on allies and villains relevant to both adventures. Regardless of which adventure you're running, this overview provides useful information, applicable to the wider campaign and helpful for foreshadowing the threats unleashed by the Cult of the Dragon.": "{@i Tyranny of Dragons}讲述了一个跨越两个冒险的史诗故事，即{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}和{@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}--这套书中的两个故事。这里介绍了两个冒险，概述了它们的背景、情节和基本联系，然后是与两个冒险有关的盟友和反派的细节。无论你在进行哪一个冒险，这个概述都提供了有用的信息，适用于更广泛的战役，并有助于预示龙之教所释放的威胁。",
	"{@i Tyranny of Dragons} is set in the Forgotten Realms on Faerûn's western shore—the Sword Coast. A thin strip of civilization stretches down this coast, where widely spaced cities are arranged like beads on a string. Roads loosely connect the cities that stretch from Luskan in the north to Calimport in the south, passing through Neverwinter, Waterdeep, Baldur's Gate, and other ports along the way. The bulk of this adventure takes place on the stretch between Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter.": "{@i Tyranny of Dragons}的背景是被遗忘的领域，在Faerûn的西海岸--剑海岸。一条细长的文明带沿着这个海岸线延伸，那里的城市像串珠子一样排列着。道路松散地连接着从北部的卢斯坎到南部的卡林波特的城市，沿途经过永夜城、水底城、博德之门和其他港口。这次冒险的主要内容发生在博德之门和永夜之间的路段。",
	"You can play this adventure with just the Dungeons & Dragons basic rules and the {@i Tyranny of Dragons} appendix online, which contains all the monsters and magic items not described in this book. Both of these supplements are available as free downloads on {@link DungeonsandDragons.com|https://dnd.wizards.com}.": "你可以只用《龙与地下城》的基本规则和网上的{@i Tyranny of Dragons}附录来玩这个冒险，其中包含了本书中没有描述的所有怪物和魔法物品。这两个附录都可以在{@link DungeonsandDragons.com|https://dnd.wizards.com}上免费下载。",
	"{@i Tyranny of Dragons} tells an epic story across two adventures, of which {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen} is the first. Characters begin this adventure at 1st level; by the end of it they should be 7th or 8th level and ready to continue with {@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}. The ideal party size is four characters. If your group is larger or smaller, you can adjust the adventure's difficulty by adjusting the number of enemies in each encounter.": "{@i Tyranny of Dragons}通过两个冒险讲述了一个史诗般的故事，其中{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}是第一个。角色从1级开始冒险；在冒险结束时，他们应该是7级或8级，并准备好继续进行{@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}。理想的队伍规模是四个角色。如果你的队伍人数较多或较少，你可以通过调整每个遭遇中的敌人数量来调整冒险的难度。",
	"At your option, you can use the milestone experience rule. Under this rule, you pick events in the campaign that cause the characters to level up. In {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}, the characters gain a level after completing each chapter except chapter 5.": "根据你的选择，你可以使用里程碑式的经验规则。在这个规则下，你在战役中挑选事件，使角色的等级提高。在{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}中，人物在完成每一章后都会获得一个等级，第五章除外。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon has been active in Faerûn for centuries. It has focused on making undead dragons to fulfill a prophecy most of that time, but that's changing.": "龙的崇拜在法鲁恩已经活跃了几个世纪。在那段时间里，它一直专注于制造不死龙来实现一个预言，但这正在改变。",
	"The new leader of the cult is a Calishite named Severin Silrajin, who believes that real draconic knowledge and power belongs to living dragons, not undead ones.": "邪教的新领袖是一个名叫塞弗林-西拉金的卡利希特人，他认为真正的龙族知识和力量属于活龙，而不是不死之身。",
	"Severin's ambition amused Tiamat, so she revealed the existence of five dragon masks to him—one for each chromatic dragon color. Individually, these ancient masks allow wearers to communicate with dragons. More importantly, a person who is erudite in draconic lore becomes a wyrmspeaker while wearing the mask, which allows the wearer to think like a dragon, gain favor among dragons, and subtly influence their behavior. When all five are brought together, they magically merge into a single Mask of the Dragon Queen. With the assembled mask, the cult can release Tiamat from her prison in the Nine Hells.": "塞弗林的野心让提亚马特很高兴，所以她向他透露了五个龙形面具的存在--一个代表每种色泽的龙。单独来看，这些古老的面具允许佩戴者与龙交流。更重要的是，一个精通龙族传说的人在戴上面具后会成为一个巫师，这让佩戴者能够像龙一样思考，在龙族中获得青睐，并巧妙地影响它们的行为。当所有五个人被聚集在一起时，他们会神奇地合并成一个龙后的面具。有了组合起来的面具，邪教可以将提亚马特从她在九层地狱的监狱中释放出来。",
	"After Severin (subtly guided by Tiamat) discovered that secret, he bent all the cult's resources to finding the long-lost dragon masks in their secret hiding places. When he recovered the red mask, Severin became the first of the wyrmspeakers, but others soon followed.": "在塞弗林（在提亚马特的巧妙引导下）发现了这个秘密后，他将邪教的所有资源用于在其秘密藏身之处寻找失落已久的龙面具。当他找到红色面具时，塞弗林成为第一个讲巫术的人，但其他人也很快跟上。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon has kept secret its goal to bring Tiamat into the world thus far. Many know of the cult's increased activity along the Sword Coast, especially in the north, but the reasons behind the resurgence are unknown.": "迄今为止，神龙教一直对其将提亚马特引入世界的目标保密。许多人都知道该邪教在剑海岸的活动有所增加，尤其是在北部，但其复苏背后的原因却不得而知。",
	"Besides his cultists, Severin has forged an alliance with a splinter faction of the Red Wizards of Thay. This small and secretive group, led by an outcast named {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}, plots to unseat the lich Szass Tam from his position over the Red Wizards. Rath believes that in exchange for his help in releasing Tiamat, she will grant him the power he needs to overthrow Szass Tam.": "除了他的崇拜者，塞弗林还与泰伊的红袍巫师的一个分裂派别结成联盟。这个小而隐秘的团体由一个名叫（%0%）的弃儿领导，阴谋将巫师萨斯-塔姆从他在红袍巫师的位置上赶下来。拉斯相信，作为释放提亚马特的交换条件，提亚马特会给予他所需的力量来推翻萨斯-谭。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon is organized in cells, which vary in size from just a handful of members to scores. Leaders in the cult are known as Wearers of Purple, and they outrank normal cultists, but no formal grades exist within the ranks of the Wearers of Purple.": "神龙教是以小组为单位组织的，小组的规模从几名成员到几十名成员不等。邪教中的领袖被称为 \"穿紫 \"者，他们的地位高于普通的邪教成员，但在 \"穿紫 \"者的队伍中没有正式的等级。",
	"Although the cult uses regalia in its rituals and its distant camps, members who operate in public places dress and act no differently from anyone else.": "尽管该邪教在其仪式和远处的营地中使用礼服，但在公共场所活动的成员的穿着和行为与其他人没有区别。",
	"The cult is not above hiring mercenaries when it has special jobs to fulfill. Indeed, many of the \"cultists\" that characters encounter in the first three chapters of this adventure are working for pay.": "当邪教有特殊的工作需要完成时，它也会雇佣雇佣兵。事实上，在这次冒险的前三章中，角色们遇到的许多 \"邪教徒 \"都是为了报酬而工作。",
	"During the time covered by the first half of this adventure, the cult already has several of the five dragon masks. While the cult works to gain more, Severin initiates the second part of his plan to release Tiamat: recruiting dragons and assembling a treasure hoard worthy of the queen of evil dragons. These efforts draw the characters' attention to the cult.": "在本冒险的前半部分所涵盖的时间里，邪教已经拥有了五个龙面具中的几个。在邪教组织努力获得更多的时候，塞弗林启动了他释放提亚马特计划的第二部分：招募龙并组建一个配得上恶龙女王的宝库。这些努力引起了人物对邪教的注意。",
	"The action begins when a town comes under attack by a dragon and its allies. Characters can intervene to save townsfolk, but not before attackers carry away an important scholar. While rescuing that captive from the raiders' camp, characters learn they are up against the Cult of the Dragon, and they have the chance to destroy a subterranean dragon hatchery that the cult guards.": "行动开始时，一个小镇受到一条龙和它的盟友的攻击。角色们可以出面拯救镇民，但在袭击者带走一位重要学者之前。在从袭击者的营地中救出这个俘虏时，角色们得知他们的对手是龙的崇拜，他们有机会摧毁该崇拜所守护的地下龙孵化场。",
	"The hatchery provides clues to the cult's operation and sends the characters on a long journey northward. During that trip, they face threats from the cult and gain some unexpected allies within the Zhentarim, a shadowy organization with an unsavory history. North of Waterdeep, the cult's contraband is offloaded at a smuggler's den for shipment to a castle long ago abandoned.": "孵化场为邪教的运作提供了线索，并将这些人物送上了向北的漫长旅程。在这次旅行中，他们面临着来自邪教的威胁，并在Zhentarim中获得了一些意想不到的盟友，这是一个有着不光彩历史的阴暗组织。在沃特迪普北部，邪教的违禁品在一个走私窝点被卸下，运往一个早已废弃的城堡。",
	"A portal beneath the castle connects to the stronghold of one of the cult's most powerful and most disgruntled members, {@creature Talis the White|HotDQ}, who can become either a deadly enemy or a crucial collaborator to the characters. With or without Talis's help, the characters must get into a flying citadel that a cloud giant placed at the cult's disposal and prevent it from reaching its destination at the Well of Dragons.": "城堡下面的一个传送门连接到邪教最强大和最不满的成员之一（%0%）的据点，他既可以成为致命的敌人，也可以成为人物的重要合作者。不管有没有塔利斯的帮助，角色们都必须进入一个云端巨人放置在邪教手中的飞行城堡，并阻止它到达龙之井的目的地。",
	"{@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT} continues the tale of {@i Tyranny of Dragons}. Characters begin this adventure at 8th level, likely having attained that level through the events of the first volume, {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}. By this adventure's conclusion, the characters should reach approximately 15th level. Four characters is the ideal party size. If your group is smaller than that, consider removing a few opponents from combat encounters. If the group is bigger, add opponents to the fights. Consider altering encounters for smaller groups to avoid overly tough battles.": "{@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}继续讲述了{@i Tyranny of Dragons}的故事。角色开始这次冒险时是8级，很可能是通过第一卷的事件达到了这个等级，{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}。在这次冒险结束时，人物应该达到大约15级。四个角色是理想的聚会规模。如果你的队伍比这个人数少，可以考虑从战斗遭遇中删除一些对手。如果队伍比较大，就在战斗中增加对手。考虑为小团体改变遭遇战，以避免过于艰难的战斗。",
	"This adventure uses the milestone experience rule. Under this rule, completing certain events in the campaign causes the characters to level up. See \"{@area Advancement|028|x}\" later in this introduction.": "这个冒险使用了里程碑式的经验规则。在这个规则下，完成战役中的某些事件会使角色的等级提高。见本介绍后面的\"（%0%）\"。",
	"The time of dragons dawns. Calling upon ancient magic and a host of draconic allies, the Cult of the Dragon seeks to unleash Tiamat from her prison in the Nine Hells. By bringing the Queen of Dragons bodily into the world, the cult plans to scour away their foes and usher in a new age of draconic dominance. So far, they've gathered great stores of treasure, forged an alliance with Thay to assist with performing the required summoning ritual, gathered the five dragon masks central to the ritual (see \"{@area Dragon Masks|009|x},\" below), and persuaded or cajoled many of the oldest and strongest evil dragons of Faerûn into supporting them.": "龙的时代来临了。召唤着古老的魔法和一大批龙族盟友，龙之崇拜试图将提亚马特从她在九层地狱的监狱中释放出来。通过将龙后带入世界，该教派计划扫除他们的敌人，并迎来一个龙族统治的新时代。到目前为止，他们已经收集了大量的财宝，与泰伊结成联盟，协助进行所需的召唤仪式，收集了仪式中最重要的五个龙面具（见下文\"{@area Dragon Masks|009|x}\"），并说服或劝说了许多法鲁恩最古老、最强大的恶龙支持他们。",
	"However, not everything has gone according to the cult's plans. The discovery of an alliance between the Cult of the Dragon and the Red Wizards of Thay has shaken the various factions aligned against both organizations. The Harpers view any such alliance as an abomination, as does the Order of the Gauntlet. The Lords' Alliance recognizes the obvious threat to the lands and rulers of the Sword Coast and the North, while the Emerald Enclave suspects that anything Thay promotes is likely against the natural order. Even the Zhentarim fear the union of two such powerful forces.": "然而，并非一切都按照邪教的计划进行。发现神龙教和泰伊的红袍巫师之间的联盟，动摇了与这两个组织结盟的各个派别。哈珀人认为任何这样的联盟都是可憎的，高塔骑士团也是如此。领主联盟认识到对剑海岸和北方的土地和统治者的明显威胁，而翡翠飞地则怀疑泰伊所提倡的任何东西都可能违反自然秩序。甚至赞塔林也害怕两个如此强大的势力的联合。",
	"News of the alliance has thus brought the various factions of the Sword Coast together. The leaders of those factions understand that they must gather and rally forces to fight the cult, even as the situation in Faerûn grows more dire. Abductions and raids undertaken by the Cult of the Dragon increase daily, and refugees are fleeing from burned-out regions under cult attack to major cities and fortresses. Villagers have abandoned their homes, fleeing the constant predation of dragons. In many cities, all-out panic has created a growing movement in favor of agreeing to the cult's demands in the hope of winning concessions in return. It is difficult to muster troops when people are afraid they will be burned by dragonfire. This is a time for heroes to inspire the people of the Sword Coast with a great victory or two. Fortunately, the Forgotten Realms has just such a group of heroes.": "因此，联盟的消息让剑海岸的各个派别走到了一起。这些派别的领导人明白，他们必须聚集和集结力量来对抗邪教，即使法鲁恩的局势变得更加严峻。神龙教的绑架和袭击每天都在增加，难民们正从被邪教攻击的烧毁地区逃往主要城市和堡垒。村民们放弃了他们的家园，以逃避龙的不断掠夺。在许多城市，全面的恐慌产生了一个日益增长的运动，赞成同意邪教的要求，希望能赢得让步的回报。当人们害怕他们会被龙火烧死时，很难召集军队。这是一个英雄们用一两个伟大的胜利来鼓舞剑海岸人民的时刻。幸运的是，被遗忘的国度就有这样一群英雄。",
	"In the first volume of {@i Tyranny of Dragons}, the Cult of the Dragon gathered up a hoard for Tiamat—then lost a portion of that hoard when Skyreach Castle fell. All the while, the cult kept secret its goal of bringing back Tiamat and its alliance with an exiled group of Red Wizards of Thay. The cult now needs only to gather enough sacrifices to power the ritual by which the dragon masks will open a portal to the Nine Hells, allowing Tiamat to travel to the Material Plane.": "在{@i Tyranny of Dragons}的第一卷中，神龙教为提亚马特收集了一批囤积物，然后在天际城堡陷落时失去了一部分囤积物。一直以来，该教派对其带回提亚马特的目标以及与流亡的泰伊红袍巫师团体的联盟保密。邪教现在只需要收集足够的祭品来为仪式提供能量，通过这个仪式，龙面具将打开通往九层地狱的入口，使提亚马特能够前往物质世界。",
	"These plans continue to move ahead as the Thayan exile {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ} and his Red Wizards bring expertise in summoning magic to the cult, preparing a tremendous blood sacrifice to empower the ritual. The alliance between wizards and cultists is fragile, however, since neither side entirely trusts the promises of the other.": "这些计划继续推进，因为塔扬流亡者（%0%）和他的红袍巫师为邪教带来了召唤魔法的专业知识，准备了一个巨大的血祭来赋予仪式。然而，巫师和邪教徒之间的联盟是脆弱的，因为双方都不完全相信对方的承诺。",
	"This second volume of {@i Tyranny of Dragons} assumes that the factions of good-aligned adventurers and the people of the Sword Coast are aware of the threat posed by the cult. What's unclear is how to deal with it. Depending on the nature of the characters and their relationships with the factions, different groups might recommend different courses of action to the heroes. It falls to the players to figure out how they want to proceed.": "这部《%0%》的第二卷假定善盟冒险者的派别和剑海岸的人们都知道邪教所带来的威胁。不清楚的是如何处理它。根据角色的性质以及他们与各派别的关系，不同的团体可能会向英雄们推荐不同的行动方案。这就需要玩家想出他们要如何进行。",
	"At the start this adventure, representatives of groups and factions from across the Sword Coast meet to discuss their concern about the Cult of the Dragon, and to draw up plans for opposing the cult. The adventurers are summoned to Waterdeep for a summit that will come to be known as the Council of Waterdeep (see {@adventure chapter 9|RoT|1|Chapter 9: Council of Waterdeep} for details).": "在这次冒险的开始，整个剑海岸的团体和派别的代表开会讨论他们对神龙教的关注，并制定了反对该教派的计划。冒险家们被召集到沃特迪普参加一个峰会，这个峰会将被称为沃特迪普议会（详见{@adventure chapter 9|RoT|1|Chapter 9: Council of Waterdeep}）。",
	"Four council sessions take place over the course of the adventure, naturally dividing events into four stages. Between the council gatherings, the characters undertake missions to thwart the cult's plans. Some of these missions will be proposed by NPCs (nonplayer characters) during council sessions. Others can be proposed by the characters. The adventurers understand that thousands of lives depend on their actions. The characters are among the greatest heroes of the Sword Coast, and the Council of Waterdeep looks to them for wise guidance and swift action.": "在冒险过程中会有四次议会会议，自然地将事件分为四个阶段。在理事会会议之间，角色们要执行任务来挫败邪教的计划。其中一些任务将由理事会会议期间的NPC（非玩家角色）提出。其他任务可以由角色提出。冒险家们明白，成千上万的生命都取决于他们的行动。这些角色是剑海岸最伟大的英雄之一，沃特德普议会期待他们提供明智的指导和迅速的行动。",
	"Many of the power groups represented on the council don't trust each other, and some even have conflicting goals. Over the course of the council's four meetings, the players and characters need to forge this disparate, feuding group into a coordinated force. Only with all factions working together and contributing to the overall effort can enough power be brought to bear against the cult to prevent Tiamat's return. The more successful the characters are in their actions against the cult, the more esteem and influence they gain with the council.": "理事会中的许多权力团体彼此不信任，有些甚至有冲突的目标。在委员会四次会议的过程中，玩家和角色需要将这个不同的、有分歧的团体锻造成一个协调的力量。只有所有派别一起工作并为整体努力做出贡献，才能有足够的力量来对抗邪教，阻止提亚马特的回归。人物对邪教的行动越成功，他们在议会中获得的尊重和影响就越大。",
	"Events are arranged in this book in a logical sequence for staging {@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}, and the chapters are numbered for ease of reference. You can even add more chapters of your own devising, or which expand on ideas the players generate.": "本书中的事件是按照逻辑顺序安排的，便于上演（%0%），各章都有编号，便于参考。你甚至可以添加你自己设计的更多章节，或者对玩家产生的想法进行扩展。",
	"The events of {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen} lead directly into {@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}. The shape of this adventure is defined by the meetings of the Council of Waterdeep, which divide the adventure into four stages.": "{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}的事件直接导致了{@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}。这场冒险的形式是由沃特德普议会的会议决定的，它将冒险分为四个阶段。",
	"The characters are invited by NPCs they know and trust to the first session of the Council of Waterdeep. (If you played {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}, {@creature Leosin Erlanthar|HotDQ} or {@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ} are likely candidates.)": "角色被他们认识和信任的NPC邀请参加水底议会的第一次会议。（如果你玩过（%0%），（%1%）或（%2%）可能是候选人。）",
	"The adventurers learn the location of one of the cult's highest-ranking leaders—Wyrmspeaker Varram. After discovering that Varram is held captive by yuan-ti in the Serpent Hills, the characters can fight the yuan-ti and negotiate to take custody of the cultist.": "冒险家们得知了邪教最高级别的领袖之一--巫师瓦拉姆的位置。在发现瓦拉姆被元老们囚禁在蛇山之后，冒险者们可以与元老们战斗，并通过谈判取得对该邪教者的监护权。",
	"Maccath the Crimson, a tiefling sorcerer of the Arcane Brotherhood, is an acknowledged expert on the {@item Draakhorn|RoT}—an ancient relic being used by the cult to summon dragons to their cause. She disappeared three years ago in the Sea of Moving Ice, where she is presently a prisoner of the white dragon Arauthator. The characters must make their way to Arauthator's iceberg lair and convince Maccath to join them. By driving away the dragon and carrying off valuable dragon lore, they deal a blow to the cult and might gain the Arcane Brotherhood as allies in the process.": "深红的马卡思是奥术兄弟会的一名铁皮人巫师，是公认的{@item Draakhorn|RoT}专家--一个被邪教用来召唤龙的古老遗物。她三年前在移动的冰海中失踪了，目前她被白龙Arauthator囚禁在那里。角色们必须前往Arauthator的冰山巢穴，说服Maccath加入他们。通过赶走龙并带走有价值的龙的传说，他们对邪教进行了打击，并可能在这个过程中获得奥术兄弟会的盟友。",
	"The cult's leaders aren't oblivious to the damage being caused by the heroes. Assassins try to stop the characters' interference, but the cultists misjudge the strength needed to complete the job.": "邪教的领导人并没有对英雄们造成的伤害视而不见。刺客们试图阻止人物的干扰，但邪教分子错误地判断了完成工作所需的力量。",
	"The characters regroup with the leaders of the Sword Coast's factions at the Council of Waterdeep, assessing their victories over the cult and planning the factions' next moves.": "角色们在沃特德普议会与剑海岸各派系的领袖重新聚集，评估他们对邪教的胜利，并计划各派系的下一步行动。",
	"The Emerald Enclave requests that the adventurers help them investigate the aftermath of cult raids led by a green dragon in the Misty Forest—a dragon possibly controlled by one of the cult's wyrmspeakers. That investigation leads to a showdown against the green dragon Chuth and Wyrmspeaker Neronvain, who has a surprising connection to the council.": "翡翠飞地要求冒险家们帮助他们调查迷雾森林中绿龙带领的邪教袭击事件的后果--绿龙可能被邪教的巫师之一控制。这项调查导致了一场与绿龙楚斯和巫师纳隆温的对决，后者与议会有着惊人的联系。",
	"The metallic dragons of the Sword Coast send word to the Council of Waterdeep that they wish to participate in the coming struggle. The adventurers are chosen to attend a council of dragons in the Sunset Mountains, pleading the humanoid factions' case to some of the oldest and most powerful creatures in Faerûn.": "剑海岸的金属龙向沃特德普的议会传话，说他们希望参与即将到来的斗争。冒险家们被选中参加落日山脉的龙族议会，向法鲁恩最古老、最强大的生物恳求人形派别的情况。",
	"After a first attempt to assassinate the heroes failed, the Cult of the Dragon tries again. With a better idea of what they're up against, they have a better chance to succeed.": "在第一次试图暗杀英雄的行动失败后，神龙教再次尝试。由于对他们的对手有了更多的了解，他们的成功机会更大。",
	"At the third meeting of the Council of Waterdeep, the characters take lead roles in shaping the fight against the cult.": "在沃特德普议会的第三次会议上，这些人物在塑造打击邪教的斗争中发挥了主导作用。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon is not without its own internal strife, as the adventurers discover when a cultist contacts them with the offer to turn over one of the dragon masks essential to Severin's plans. The characters must infiltrate a cult stronghold and claim the mask, then save a nearby village from the blue dragon that means to take the relic back.": "当一个邪教分子与他们联系，提出交出对塞弗林的计划至关重要的一个龙形面具时，冒险者们发现，龙之教并非没有内部纷争。冒险家们必须潜入邪教的据点，夺取面具，然后从企图夺回遗物的蓝龙手中拯救附近的村庄。",
	"The ritual that will bring Tiamat to Faerûn is too complex for the cult's spellcasters to perform without their Red Wizard allies—all Thayan exiles. The adventurers travel to Thay to forge an alliance with the Red Wizards, whose lich lord Szass Tam hungers for revenge against the exiles. The Red Wizards of Thay are evil to the core, though, and the delegates must tread carefully as they present their case.": "将提亚马特带到法鲁恩的仪式太过复杂，如果没有他们的红袍巫师盟友--都是泰安的流亡者，邪教的施法者们是无法完成的。冒险家们前往泰伊，与红袍巫师结成联盟，他们的巫师领主萨斯-塔姆渴望向流亡者复仇。不过，泰伊的红袍巫师们邪恶至极，代表们在陈述他们的情况时必须小心谨慎。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon now knows the adventurers' strengths and methods. If the characters don't take precautions to safeguard themselves, the cult stands a good chance of killing them all with a third attack.": "神龙教现在知道了冒险者们的实力和方法。如果人物不采取预防措施保护自己，邪教很有可能通过第三次攻击将他们全部杀死。",
	"At the final meeting of the council, the characters must work to unite the factions of the Sword Coast for the final battle against the Cult of the Dragon. Severin is ready to fulfill his plans, and the combined forces of the Sword Coast must strike now if the cult is to be stopped.": "在议会的最后一次会议上，角色们必须努力团结剑海岸的各个派别，与神龙教进行最后的战斗。塞弗林已经准备好实现他的计划，如果要阻止邪教，剑海岸的联合力量现在必须出击。",
	"At the Well of Dragons, a battle unfolds that will decide the fate of Faerûn. The factions of the Sword Coast fight alongside new and unexpected allies, facing off against the assembled might of the dragon cultists, flights of chromatic dragons, other monsters, and mercenaries.

	"{@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT} is an open-framework adventure designed for higher-level characters. As such, not all your game sessions need to stick to the main track of the adventure narrative. Additional events, rumors, and encounters can be used as needed or added as side treks or distractions. The following encounter seeds are meant to be used when you want to break up the narrative or if the players get off track.

	"The Cult of the Dragon expands its operation in larger and bolder ways. Its leaders send diplomatic missions to Berdusk, Triel, and other settlements demanding tribute—and offering protection from dragon raids for those who comply.

	"The Cult of the Dragon has existed for centuries.

Dragons shall rule the world entire...\" Severin's quest to reshape the cult led him to the dragon Hoondarrh, \"the Red Rage of Mintarn.\" The fact that Severin not only survived this encounter but befriended the dragon impressed Tiamat in her exile in the Nine Hells. As a reward and further test, she allowed Severin a scrap of knowledge regarding the existence of the five dragon masks. Severin took that bit of information and did what few others could have accomplished, searching for and finding all five masks. The task took years to complete, and it led directly to the crisis that Faerûn now faces.": "在提亚马特的启发下，塞弗林重新审视了萨姆斯特尔翻译的文本，发现了不同的解释，认为 \"除了破碎的王座，什么都不会留下，除了死者，没有统治者。龙将统治整个世界......\" 塞弗林对重塑邪教的追求使他找到了龙Hoondarrh，\"Mintarn的红色怒火\"。塞弗林不仅在这次遭遇中幸存下来，而且还与龙结为好友，这给流亡在九层地狱的提亚马特留下了深刻印象。作为奖励和进一步的测试，她允许塞弗林获得有关五龙面具存在的知识碎片。塞弗林带着这一点信息，做了很少有人能完成的事情，寻找并找到了所有五个面具。这项任务耗时多年才完成，它直接导致了法鲁恩现在面临的危机。",
	"Severin kept the red mask for himself. As other masks were found, he presented them to his closest allies in the Cult of the Dragon, granting each the power of a wyrmspeaker. Using the magic of the dragon masks, this Inner Circle of Wyrmspeakers helps Severin prepare the way for Tiamat's return.": "塞弗林为自己保留了红色面具。随着其他面具的发现，他把它们送给了他在神龙教中最亲密的盟友，赋予每个人以巫师的力量。利用龙面具的魔力，这个内部的巫师圈帮助塞弗林为提亚马特的回归做好准备。",
	"The plots of the Cult of the Dragon are secret, but its existence is not. Most folk of the Sword Coast have heard of the cult, but know only that its members revere evil dragons. The cult recruits new members in major cities, and word quickly gets around. Moreover, many cultists engage in legitimate business or are assigned to ordinary academic research. Only a relative few serve as thieves, assassins, and spies.": "神龙教的阴谋是秘密的，但它的存在却不是。剑海岸的大多数人都听说过这个邪教，但只知道其成员崇尚邪恶的龙。该邪教在主要城市招募新成员，消息很快就传开了。此外，许多邪教成员从事合法的商业活动，或被指派从事普通的学术研究。只有相对少数人充当小偷、刺客和间谍。",

Characters trying to pass as cultists might find this sign useful if they don't overdo it.": "崇拜者在公开场合避免穿这种服装，但知道如何寻找的人往往可以从人群中挑选出一个隐姓埋名的龙崇拜者。教徒们有时会用提亚马特的手势相互问候：伸出右手，手心向前，五指张开，模仿提亚马特的五个头。试图冒充邪教徒的角色可能会发现这个手势很有用，如果他们不做得太过分的话。",
	"Cult members venerate dragons as powerful icons and masters, but their worship is reserved for Tiamat. They look forward to the Dragon Queen's return, believing that she will destroy mortal civilization and usher in a glorious reign of dragons—and of those who helped bring about draconic rule. The complex plot dedicated to bring Tiamat to Faerûn has so far seen the cult recover the five dragon masks and collect an immense treasure worthy of the Dragon Queen. All that now remains is to raise her temple in the Well of Dragons, sacrifice hundreds of victims whose souls will power an ancient ritual, and then use that ritual to open a portal through which Tiamat will emerge from the Nine Hells.": "邪教成员把龙当作强大的偶像和主人来敬仰，但他们的崇拜只保留给提亚马特。他们期待着龙后的回归，相信她会摧毁凡人的文明，迎来龙的辉煌统治--以及那些帮助实现龙族统治的人。到目前为止，致力于将提亚马特带到法鲁恩的复杂阴谋中，邪教组织已经找回了五个龙形面具，并收集了值得龙后使用的巨大财宝。现在剩下的就是在龙之井中建立她的神庙，牺牲数百名受害者，他们的灵魂将为一个古老的仪式提供动力，然后用这个仪式打开一个门户，让提亚马特从九层地狱中出现。",
	"The cult has a simple hierarchical structure, consisting of initiates on the bottom, four ranks for cultists, and one highest rank for \"Wearers of Purple\"—the lords, leaders, and cult masters of particular locales.

The Wearers of Purple have an affinity for talking to and negotiating with dragons—the gift of wyrmspeaking. Dozens of Wearers of Purple are spread throughout the Cult of the Dragon, and all are able to marshal the cult's resources.": "紫色穿戴者站在邪教人形等级制度的顶端，他们的话就是他们所指挥的城市、据点和巢穴中的邪教徒的法律。他们是邪教中唯一穿着紫色衣服的成员，而且大多数人都很自豪地炫耀这种颜色。紫色穿戴者有一种与龙交谈和谈判的亲和力--巫妖之语的天赋。数十名紫色穿戴者分布在整个神龙教中，他们都能调集教派的资源。",
	"Only Severin's inner circle can promote a dragonsoul to a Wearer of Purple, granting that character a base of operations and funds. Most new Wearers of Purple have already developed a working relationship with a dragon as part of their power and authority.

They treat with dragons of those colors to recruit more dragons to the cause, and plan cult missions that advance Severin's plots.": "这四位紫袍人是龙面具的守护者，也是塞弗林在召唤提亚马特的努力中最忠实的仆人。每位巫师都有一个龙形面具，除非在最糟糕的情况下，否则他们从不放弃，而且只有在塞弗林或龙族盟友的要求下才会放弃。内圈的成员都对一种特定颜色的色龙有亲和力。他们与这些颜色的龙打交道，以招募更多的龙加入这一事业，并策划邪教任务，推进塞弗林的阴谋。",

	"Under Severin's leadership, most cultists are devoted to Tiamat—but not all. Some of the old guard dislike the cult's new direction, and long for the established traditions and the rise of the dracoliches. A common thought among the dracolich loyalists is that Severin is being played by the fiendish Tiamat. Notable among these members of the old guard are Naergoth Bladelord, the former commander of the stronghold at the Well of Dragons, and Jorgen Pawl and Iskander, two high-ranking cultists in command of Xonthal's Tower.": "在塞弗林的领导下，大多数邪教成员都献身于提亚马特--但不是全部。一些守旧派不喜欢邪教的新方向，他们渴望既有的传统和龙卷风的崛起。德拉科利奇的忠实信徒们普遍认为塞弗林被邪恶的提亚马特所玩弄。这些守旧派成员中值得注意的是龙之井据点的前指挥官纳戈斯-布拉德洛德（Naergoth Bladelord），以及约根-帕尔（Jorgen Pawl）和伊斯坎德（Iskander），这两位高级邪教人员在松塔尔塔的指挥下。",
	"Cultists are suitable foes for the adventurers in most situations. They keep a low profile in public, so characters are unlikely to see cultists in full regalia on the streets of Waterdeep or Scornubel. As their plots near fruition, however, the cultists grow bolder and might engage the adventurers openly.": "在大多数情况下，邪教徒是冒险者的合适敌人。他们在公共场合保持低调，所以角色们不太可能在沃特迪普或斯科努贝尔的街道上看到身着盛装的邪教分子。然而，随着他们的计划接近尾声，邪教徒们会变得更加大胆，并可能与冒险家们公开交锋。",
	"By the start of {@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}, the effects of the cult's activities are visible across the Sword Coast. The scorched ruins of farming communities pillaged by cultists for Tiamat's hoard are a common enough occurrence that travelers know something is amiss.": "在{@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}开始的时候，邪教活动的影响在整个剑海岸都是可见的。被邪教分子掠夺了蒂阿马特的囤积物的农业社区的焦土废墟是一种常见的现象，以至于旅行者知道有些事情是不对劲的。",

A grim, dismal region spread across a towering plateau, Thay is defended by an army of undead warriors and ruled by the lich Szass Tam and the zulkirs he appoints to rule over the eight schools of magic. The Red Wizards of Thay are known across Faerûn, and are easily recognized by their distinctive crimson robes and the arcane sigils tattooed onto their shaved heads. Because of their evil reputation, Red Wizards are arrested or killed on the spot in many lands. For that reason, they often travel in disguise, invisibly, or by magical means.": "红袍巫师来自泰伊，在剑海岸以东两千多英里处。泰伊是一个遍布高耸高原的阴森恐怖的地区，由亡灵战士组成的军队防守，并由巫师萨斯-塔姆和他任命的祖尔基尔统治着八个魔法学校。泰伊的红袍巫师在整个法鲁恩都很有名，他们很容易被认出，因为他们穿着独特的深红色长袍，剃光的头上纹着神秘的符号。由于他们的邪恶名声，红袍巫师在许多地方都会被逮捕或当场杀死。出于这个原因，他们经常乔装打扮，隐身，或通过魔法手段出行。",
	"For many years, Szass Tam's grip on absolute power in Thay has been weakened by internal strife. Mortal Red Wizards have risen against their undead masters, destroying some of Szass Tam's lich zulkirs and thinning the ranks of other undead. Little is known of the conflict beyond Thay's borders, however. In this quiet civil war, both sides fear that too much attrition will make Thay a target for its long list of enemies. Szass Tam questions the allegiance of all living Red Wizards outside Thay, and has made it clear that death and worse await any who oppose him.": "多年来，萨斯-塔姆对泰伊绝对权力的控制由于内部纷争而被削弱了。凡人的红袍巫师们已经起来反对他们的亡灵主人，摧毁了萨斯-谭的一些巫师祖尔基尔，并削弱了其他亡灵的队伍。然而，人们对泰伊边界以外的冲突知之甚少。在这场平静的内战中，双方都担心过多的损耗会使泰伊成为其众多敌人的目标。萨斯-谭质疑泰伊以外所有活着的红袍巫师的忠诚度，并明确表示，任何反对他的人都将面临死亡和更坏的结果。",
	"One such Red Wizard exile is {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}, an illusionist of great skill who long ago made the Sword Coast his home. Having a natural interest in dragons, it wasn't long before {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ} came into contact with the Cult of the Dragon and Severin. The young, ambitious cult leader sought powerful magic to locate the scattered dragon masks and to perform the ritual that would summon Tiamat from the Nine Hells. {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ} dreamed of an army that could confront and defeat Szass Tam. Out of mutual need, their alliance was born.": "其中一位红袍巫师流亡者是{@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}，他是一位技艺高超的幻术师，很久以前就以剑海岸为家。由于对龙有着天生的兴趣，不久后（1%）就接触到了龙和塞弗林的崇拜。这位年轻的、雄心勃勃的邪教领袖寻求强大的魔法，以找到散落的龙面具，并举行仪式，将蒂阿玛特从九层地狱召唤出来。{@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}梦想着有一支能够对抗和击败萨斯-谭的军队。出于相互需要，他们的联盟诞生了。",
	"The secret cornerstone of this union is {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}'s belief that once Tiamat returns, she will see that the Red Wizards are more useful allies than the devoted but magically weak cultists. {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ} hopes that Tiamat will show her gratitude for the pivotal role he and his fellow Red Wizards played in her return, granting them an army of dragons with which to assault Thay. After unseating Szass Tam, {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ} plans to take his place at the head of all Red Wizards. Whether Tiamat will grant such a reward—or have any further use for the Red Wizards at all—remains unknown.": "这个联盟的秘密基石是{@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}相信一旦提亚马特回来，她会看到红袍巫师是比那些虔诚但魔法薄弱的邪教徒更有用的盟友。{@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}希望提亚马特会对他和他的红袍巫师同伴在她的回归中所扮演的关键角色表示感谢，赐予他们一支龙的军队来攻击泰伊。在击败萨斯-塔姆后，{@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}计划取代他成为所有红袍巫师的领袖。提亚玛特是否会给予这样的奖励，或者对红袍巫师有任何进一步的利用，都是未知数。",
	"Not all members of the Cult of the Dragon are happy about the Red Wizards' involvement in the cult's plans. Wyrmspeaker Varram foresees trouble in the cult joining forces with {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}'s splinter sect. He has warned Severin about the potential danger, to no avail.": "并非所有的神龙教成员都对红袍巫师参与该教派的计划感到高兴。Wyrmspeaker Varram预见到邪教与{@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}的分裂教派联手会带来麻烦。他已经警告过塞弗林这个潜在的危险，但无济于事。",
	"Red Wizards can be encountered anywhere on the Sword Coast (use {@creature mage} stats if necessary), whether operating alongside cultists or on their own. They most often work alone, but two or three Red Wizards might join forces for an important assignment. In a public area where their appearance could put them at risk, Red Wizards favor deep hoods and scarves to hide their faces. Their undead {@creature wight} bodyguards are usually nearby—and often {@condition invisible}. Each Red Wizard specializes in a single school of magic, but all learn spells outside their specialty schools.": "红袍巫师可以在剑海岸的任何地方遇到（必要时使用{@creature mage}状态），无论是与邪教徒一起行动还是单独行动。他们最常单独行动，但两个或三个红袍巫师可能会联合起来执行一项重要的任务。在公共区域，他们的外表可能会使他们处于危险之中，红袍巫师喜欢用深色的头巾和围巾来掩盖他们的脸。他们的不死保镖（%1%）通常就在附近，而且经常（%2%）。每个红袍巫师都专攻一个魔法流派，但都会学习其专业流派以外的法术。",
	"Red Wizards don't share the cultists' fanaticism for Tiamat. For them, bringing the Dragon Queen into the world is just one stage of what they call the Thayan Resurrection—the larger plan to destroy Szass Tam and reclaim Thay. They tolerate the dragon cultists but do not acknowledge them as equals.": "红袍巫师并不认同邪教分子对提亚马特的狂热。对他们来说，将龙后带到这个世界上只是他们所谓的 \"泰雅复活 \"的一个阶段--摧毁萨斯坦并夺回泰伊的更大计划。他们容忍龙的崇拜者，但不承认他们是平等的。",
	"Not every Red Wizard on the Sword Coast is working for {@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ} or the Cult of the Dragon. Some pursue their own interests, while others are spies for Szass Tam. The adventurers might thus find themselves making uneasy alliances with characters they would normally never trust, since the easiest and surest way to eliminate a Red Wizard in service to the cult is to betray that wizard's location to an agent of Szass Tam. However, characters who get too close to Szass Tam's servants and his paranoid vendetta against the Red Wizard exiles might find themselves at the mercy of the Thayans. This possibility is explored more fully in {@adventure chapter 16|RoT|7}.": "剑海岸的每个红袍巫师并非都在为{@creature Rath Modar|HotDQ}或神龙教工作。有些人追求自己的利益，而有些人则是萨斯-谭的间谍。因此，冒险者们可能会发现自己与他们通常不会信任的角色结成了不安的联盟，因为要消灭一个为邪教服务的红袍巫师，最简单和最肯定的方法就是将该巫师的位置出卖给萨斯-谭的代理人。然而，那些与萨斯-谭的仆人和他对红袍巫师流亡者的偏执仇杀走得太近的人物，可能会发现自己受到泰安人的摆布。这种可能性将在{@adventure chapter 16|RoT|7}中得到更充分的探讨。",
	"Tiamat has long threatened Faerûn, often appearing in lands such as Chessenta and Unther to drive mortals to worship her awesome power. Although mortals don't know it, the end of the Sundering and the Era of Upheaval also put an end to such direct meddling by the gods. Without powerful magic and mortal aid, Tiamat cannot travel from her home in Avernus into the world.": "Tiamat长期以来一直威胁着Faerûn，经常出现在Chessenta和Unther等地，驱使凡人去崇拜她的可怕力量。虽然凡人不知道，但 \"毁灭 \"和 \"动乱时代 \"的结束也结束了诸神的这种直接插手。没有强大的魔法和凡人的帮助，提亚马特无法从她在阿弗纳斯的家进入这个世界。",
	"Avernus is a boulder-strewn desolation where fiery comets streak across the sky and devil aristocrats rule from dismal iron fortresses. The River Styx saws a jagged course through Avernus's basalt cliffs, winds its way across ashen plains, and eventually plunges through a yawning pit into the eight levels of the Hells below. All the rivers of Avernus feed into the Styx, each one flowing red with blood beneath a roiling cloud of flies.": "阿弗纳斯是一片巨石遍布的荒芜之地，火红的彗星划过天空，恶魔贵族们在凄凉的铁堡垒中进行统治。冥河在阿弗纳斯的玄武岩悬崖上锯出一条锯齿状的路线，蜿蜒穿过灰暗的平原，最终穿过一个大坑坠入下面八层地狱。阿弗纳斯的所有河流都汇入冥河，每条河流都在滚滚的苍蝇云下流淌着红色的血液。",
	"Asmodeus recently reinstated the fallen angel Zariel as the Archduchess of Avernus, reversing an earlier decision that allowed a pit fiend named Bel to take the throne. While in exile from her seat of power, Zariel was at the mercy of Tiamat—a fate that rankles her still. Despite her power as ruler of the first layer of the Nine Hells, Zariel cannot kill the dragon goddess, and she sees the summoning of Tiamat to the world as a way to be rid of her.": "阿斯莫德最近恢复了堕落天使扎里尔作为阿弗纳斯大公夫人的地位，推翻了先前允许一个名为贝尔的坑道恶魔夺取王位的决定。当扎丽尔从她的权力所在地流亡时，她受到了提亚马特的摆布--这是令她至今感到不安的命运。尽管她拥有九层地狱第一层统治者的权力，但扎瑞尔无法杀死龙神，她认为将提亚马特召唤到这个世界是摆脱她的一种方式。",
	"Zariel has directed her mortal agents to assist those who seek to free Tiamat, and her power has made it easier for the Red Wizards to summon devils and for the Cult of the Dragon to find more adherents. However, just as Zariel wants Tiamat out, other devils would be happy to see the Dragon Queen stay in Avernus. Foremost among them is the deposed pit fiend Bel and the devils still loyal to him.": "扎丽尔已经指示她的凡人特工协助那些寻求释放提亚马特的人，她的力量使红袍巫师更容易召唤魔鬼，使龙之崇拜找到更多的信徒。然而，就像扎里尔希望提亚马特离开一样，其他魔鬼也很乐意看到龙后留在阿弗纳斯。其中最重要的是被废黜的地狱魔王贝尔和仍然忠于他的魔鬼。",
	"Ordinarily, the Cult of the Dragon has nothing to do with devils. However, releasing Tiamat into the world is a massive undertaking, and Severin has called on every resource he can. Though many of his allies among the Red Wizards are well schooled in summoning and commanding devils, doing so is never a straightforward process. Devils cannot leave the Nine Hells of their own accord, and though Asmodeus can bend these laws, he seldom does. Most devils in the Material Plane were summoned there by mortal mages who expended tremendous amounts of magical power to breach the barriers that separate the Nine Hells from other planes.": "通常情况下，神龙教与魔鬼毫无关系。然而，将提亚马特释放到这个世界上是一项巨大的工程，塞弗林已经调用了他能调用的所有资源。尽管他在红袍巫师中的许多盟友在召唤和指挥魔鬼方面都很有经验，但这样做从来都不是一个简单的过程。魔鬼不能主动离开九层地狱，尽管阿斯摩德可以弯曲这些法律，但他很少这样做。物质界的大多数魔鬼都是由凡人法师召唤而来，他们耗费了巨大的魔力来突破九幽地狱与其他位面之间的障碍。",
	"Devils aren't numerous in {@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT} until the final showdown at the Well of Dragons, but their presence elsewhere in the adventure (including the additional encounter \"Devilish Demands\") should make attentive players wonder at the connection between devils and dragons. Devils are supreme manipulators, and if the characters have the opportunity to speak with devils that aren't working for the cult, don't be afraid to offer them diabolical assistance. Such an offer should put all characters—not just those of good alignment—in a bind. Bargaining with devils is a fool's game, but if the alternative is the end of the world, it might be the adventurers' only option.": "在龙之井的最后决战之前，魔鬼的数量并不多（%0%），但是他们在冒险的其他地方的出现（包括额外的遭遇 \"魔鬼的要求\"）应该让细心的玩家对魔鬼和龙之间的联系感到好奇。魔鬼是最高的操纵者，如果角色有机会与不为邪教工作的魔鬼交谈，不要害怕向他们提供邪恶的帮助。这样的提议应该让所有的角色--不仅仅是那些有良好关系的角色--陷入困境。与魔鬼讨价还价是一个愚蠢的游戏，但是如果替代方案是世界末日，这可能是冒险家们的唯一选择。",
	"Devils in the adventure should always be one step ahead of the adventurers. Characters who like to charge in and decide on strategy later will find that their diabolical foes have well-executed plans. If the characters plan two steps ahead, the devils are one step beyond that. Nothing mortals do should ever surprise them.": "冒险中的魔鬼应该总是比冒险者领先一步。那些喜欢冲锋陷阵，稍后再决定策略的角色会发现，他们的恶魔般的敌人有着完善的计划。如果角色提前两步计划，魔鬼们就会超前一步。凡人所做的任何事情都不应该让他们吃惊。",
	"Severin and his supporters intend to use the ancient draconic artifact known as the {@item Draakhorn|RoT} to rally the chromatic dragons to Tiamat's cause. However, chromatic dragons are notoriously arrogant, territorial, greedy, and suspicious of any creatures begging favors—especially if those creatures might be a threat. Getting dragons to cooperate is a monumental task, even when bringing the Queen of Dragons into the world is the ultimate goal.": "塞弗林和他的支持者们打算利用被称为\"%0%\"的古代龙族神器来召集色龙为提亚马特的事业服务。然而，色龙是出了名的傲慢、领地、贪婪，而且对任何乞求恩惠的生物都持怀疑态度--特别是当这些生物可能是一种威胁时。让龙合作是一项艰巨的任务，即使把龙后带入世界是最终目标。",
	"The Cult of the Dragon has a secret weapon for dealing with chromatic dragons, in the form of the five dragon masks. Even with a dragon mask, the process of influencing a dragon remains arduous and dangerous—though the payoff is enormous. These relics give their wearers the ability to communicate with dragons, but more importantly, they impart a subtle influence over dragons that cannot be detected. Dragons cannot be controlled by the masks, but they can be swayed by ideas and proposals that they would not normally find persuasive.": "神龙教有一个对付色龙的秘密武器，就是五个龙形面具。即使有了龙面具，影响龙的过程仍然是艰巨而危险的--尽管回报是巨大的。这些遗物赋予佩戴者与龙沟通的能力，但更重要的是，它们对龙施加了一种无法察觉的微妙影响。龙不能被面具控制，但它们可以被通常认为没有说服力的想法和建议所动摇。",
	"The power of the chromatic dragons is a motif running through every aspect of Tyranny of Dragons: {@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}. As the events of the adventure unfold, more and more dragons respond to the {@item Draakhorn|RoT|Draakhorn's} rumbling moan and journey to the Well of Dragons—a migration that inspires alarm and panic in people across Faerûn.": "色素龙的力量是贯穿《龙的暴政》各个方面的一个主题。{@adventure The Rise of Tiamat|RoT}. 随着冒险事件的展开，越来越多的龙对{@item Draakhorn|RoT|Draakhorn's}隆隆的呻吟声做出反应，并前往龙之井--这种迁移激发了整个法鲁恩人们的警觉和恐慌。",
	"Characters and players should seldom be allowed to forget that the evil dragons are on the move. Whenever the adventurers are outside, they might see a dragon winging overhead in the distance. The shadow of a dragon could fall across the adventurers in the daytime, and dark draconic wings might momentarily blot out the moon at night. When the characters arrive in a settlement, they should hear stories about dragon sightings and attacks. When they travel, burned-out hamlets and demolished caravans line the road.": "应该很少让角色和玩家忘记恶龙在移动。只要冒险者在外面，他们就可能看到一条龙在远处的上空飞翔。白天，龙的影子可能会落在冒险者的身上，晚上，黑暗的龙翼可能会瞬间遮住月亮。当人物到达一个定居点时，他们应该听到关于龙的踪迹和攻击的故事。当他们旅行时，烧毁的小村庄和被拆毁的商队会在路上出现。",
	"Dragons are among the oldest, most intelligent, and most powerful monsters in Faerûn and the Dungeons & Dragons game. Chromatic dragons are evil and merciless, and every battle against these creatures should be a life-or-death struggle. No dragon should ever fall without the heroes suffering during the battle. Chromatic dragons use every possible advantage with no regard for fairness, and their chief advantage is flight. A dragon never fights on foot where enemies might hack at it when it can soar majestically out of reach and slaughter foes with its breath weapon. Only in its lair will a dragon typically engage in melee, and then only if its hoard is threatened.": "龙是Faerûn和《龙与地下城》游戏中最古老、最聪明、最强大的怪物之一。色素龙是邪恶和无情的，每一次与这些生物的战斗都应该是一场生死攸关的斗争。在战斗中，没有任何一条龙可以在英雄们不受伤害的情况下倒下。色素龙利用一切可能的优势，不顾公平，而它们的主要优势是飞行。龙从不在敌人可能砍杀它的地方步行作战，因为它可以雄伟地翱翔在敌人的视野之外，用它的呼吸武器屠杀敌人。只有在它的巢穴里，龙才会进行近战，而且只有在它的囤积物受到威胁时才会进行。",
	"Characters who can tackle the challenges of this adventure are high enough level to have allies raised from the dead when those allies fall to a draconic foe. If the characters can't do so themselves, their allies in the Order of the Gauntlet or the Harpers should be willing to help out.": "能够应对这次冒险的挑战的角色等级足够高，当这些盟友倒在龙人的敌人面前时，他们可以让盟友从死里复活。如果角色自己不能这样做，他们在高塔骑士团或哈珀斯的盟友应该会愿意帮忙。",
	"With lifetimes of a thousand years or more to lose, chromatic dragons have no interest in dying in battle against mere humanoids, and they don't sacrifice themselves nobly for any cause—Tiamat included. A dragon caught in a losing battle takes any escape that presents itself, most often simply soaring away. This changes during the final showdown at the Well of Dragons, however, when Tiamat can be seen clawing her way through the portal from the Nine Hells.": "有着一千年甚至更久的寿命，色龙对在与普通人类的战斗中死去没有兴趣，它们不会为任何事业高尚地牺牲自己--包括Tiamat。陷入败局的龙会采取任何逃避的方式，最常见的是简单地腾空而去。然而，在龙之井的最后决战中，这种情况发生了变化，人们可以看到提亚马特在九层地狱的门户中张牙舞爪。",
	"If the characters claimed Skyreach Castle in {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}, they might well hear from a frost giant diplomat who shows up to reclaim it as property of the giants who built it. A frost giant named Harshnag lives on Mount Sar north of Waterdeep, and he is sometimes called upon when the Sword Coast faces dire threats. The player characters could fly the citadel to him or—in a more dramatic interlude—he might come to a council meeting and demand the citadel's return on behalf of his kin so that he might rally them against their ancient foes.": "如果人物在{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}中宣称拥有Skyreach城堡，他们很可能会听到一个冰霜巨人外交官出现，将其作为建造它的巨人的财产收回。一个名叫哈什纳格（Harshnag）的冰霜巨人住在沃特迪普北部的萨尔山上，当剑海岸面临可怕的威胁时，他有时会被召唤。玩家角色可以把城堡飞给他，或者在一个更戏剧性的插曲中，他可能会来参加议会会议，代表他的亲属要求归还城堡，这样他就可以召集他们来对抗他们古老的敌人。",
	"If the player characters did not claim the citadel (or crashed it), this option is not available to them.": "如果玩家角色没有认领城堡（或将其撞毁），他们就不能使用这个选项。",
	"Giants are unlikely to appear side by side with dragons anywhere before the final showdown at the Well of Dragons. However, characters who gain any insight into the giants' alliance with the dragons should understand its apocalyptic significance.": "在龙之井的最后决战之前，巨人不太可能在任何地方与龙并肩出现。然而，对巨人与龙的联盟有任何了解的角色都应该理解其世界末日的意义。",
	"Several powerful organizations battle the Cult of the Dragon even as the party does. The characters are key players in the drama, but everyone in Faerûn has a stake in the outcome of the battle against Tiamat and her allies.

	"The secret society known as the Harpers has been disbanded and rebuilt several times over its long history. The latest incarnation of the group retains its focus on gathering information, keeping a close watch on the balance of power in Faerûn, and promoting fairness and equality in quiet, unobtrusive ways. Harpers try to keep out of the public eye, preferring secrecy to fame and using knowledge to win the day over brute force. However, as the Cult of the Dragon grows more brazen and destructive, the Harpers are forced to act more openly in their opposition.": "被称为哈珀斯的秘密组织在其漫长的历史中已经被解散和重建了好几次。该组织的最新化身仍然专注于收集信息，密切关注法鲁恩的权力平衡，并以安静、不引人注意的方式促进公平和平等。哈珀斯试图远离公众的视线，宁可选择保密也不选择出名，并利用知识来赢得胜利，而不是用蛮力。然而，随着神龙教越来越肆无忌惮和具有破坏性，哈珀人被迫采取更公开的反对行动。",

Slaying a wyrmspeaker will also serve the party well, while capturing and delivering such a villain to justice will raise them even higher in the order's sight.": "正如善行必须在光明中进行，让所有人都能看到一样，邪恶也必须回避，并处处与之斗争。秩序的成员可以被英雄和正义的行为所征服，但他们会反对与邪恶合作或容忍邪恶的角色。骑士团最容易被那些表现出英雄主义和神圣天意的行为所动摇--例如，联合金属龙来对抗提亚马特的孩子。杀死一个讲巫术的人也会给党带来好处，而捕获并将这样的恶棍绳之以法会让他们在教团的眼中地位更高。",

	"The Emerald Enclave is dedicated to maintaining balance in the natural order and combating the forces that threaten that balance. Members of the enclave live in the wilderness or in small communities, and the order has almost no representatives in towns and cities. They are not opposed to civilization, however. Rather, they seek to prevent civilization and wilderness from harming one another. Those who serve the Emerald Enclave are masters of survival and living off the land, of navigating through the wilderness, and of reading the signs that indicate approaching weather, the passage of creatures, and the general weal of the natural world.": "绿宝石飞地致力于维护自然秩序的平衡，打击威胁这种平衡的力量。飞地的成员生活在荒野或小型社区，该组织在城镇几乎没有代表。然而，他们并不反对文明。相反，他们寻求防止文明和荒野相互伤害。那些为绿宝石飞地服务的人是生存和靠土地生活的大师，是在荒野中航行的大师，是读懂预示着天气临近、生物通过以及自然界总体利益的迹象的大师。",

	"There is no question that Tiamat must be stopped, but the Emerald Enclave wants to see the world restored to order. This sometimes means taking a middle ground in battles between good and evil.

He would rather not kill unnecessarily, however.": "毫无疑问，提亚马特必须被阻止，但翡翠飞地希望看到世界恢复秩序。这有时意味着在善与恶的斗争中采取中间立场。德兰敏锐地意识到伴随着龙神教最近的活动而产生的破坏。他知道该邪教必须被摧毁，因为它破坏了自然界的平衡，而且他知道许多支持该邪教的龙会在结束前死去。然而，他宁愿不做无谓的杀戮。",

	"Because the Lords' Alliance is a confederation, the order sends seven delegates to the Council of Waterdeep, each effectively representing his or her own faction.

	"Laeral Silverhand brings centuries of leadership experience and an impressive reputation to the negotiations. A consummate diplomat, she can wield words that wound or soothe with equal ease. As the Open Lord of Waterdeep, she holds great sway with all the delegates except Dagult Neverember, who believes that she engineered his removal from the position of Open Lord.": "Laeral Silverhand为谈判带来了几个世纪的领导经验和令人印象深刻的声誉。作为一个完美的外交家，她可以轻松地挥舞话语，使人受伤或舒缓。作为沃特德普的开放领主，她在所有的代表中都有很大的影响力，除了达古特-纽伦堡（Dagult Neverember），他认为是她策划了将他从开放领主的位置上撤下来。",
	"Laeral's primary concern is keeping all parties at the negotiating table, and making sure that concrete actions result from each council's discussions. However, she is leery of committing troops to battle. No stranger to the horrors of war, she is keenly aware that the lands represented by the Lords' Alliance need their soldiers for the protection of their own people. Only when convinced that the Cult of the Dragon is likely to succeed in summoning Tiamat does she change her mind. However, she doesn't trust the adventurers with leadership unless their deeds in the field and at the negotiating table have impressed her.": "拉伊尔的首要关注点是让所有各方都在谈判桌上，并确保每个理事会的讨论都能产生具体的行动。然而，她对派遣军队参加战斗持谨慎态度。她对战争的恐怖并不陌生，她敏锐地意识到，领主联盟所代表的土地需要他们的士兵来保护自己的人民。只有在确信神龙教有可能成功召唤提亚马特时，她才改变主意。然而，她并不信任冒险者的领导权，除非他们在战场上和谈判桌上的事迹让她印象深刻。",
	"If the adventurers sway Laeral to their side, she speaks highly of the party in the periods between council sessions.

	"In the first council meeting, Lord Dagult's resources have been spread thin between the massive investments he's made in rebuilding Neverwinter and in maintaining dominance in Waterdeep.

Like {@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ} of the Order of the Gauntlet, Connerad responds well to bold demonstrations of heroism.

Still, at times like these when the world needs heroes, he doesn't like being reminded that he must watch the fight from the sidelines.": "作为一名资深的屠龙者，伊斯特瓦尔的腿上有一道伤口，可以抵抗魔法的治疗，他用一根绿龙的骨头做成的手杖行走。这位圣骑士可以成为龙的传说的有用来源，但他的建议总是受到保护。他认为自己的虚弱是他的神Lathander对傲慢的危险的一种提醒。与他的神的精神相称，伊斯特瓦尔选择把他的伤痛当作鼓励他人的英雄事迹的理由，即使他自己的传说已经消失。不过，在这种世界需要英雄的时候，他并不喜欢被提醒他必须在一旁观战。",
	"Isteval believes in heroes as the spark that can ignite the flames of righteousness in others and the light that chases away the darkness of evil. Seeing this spark in the adventurers makes the paladin one of the party's strongest advocates at the Council of Waterdeep, as long as they pursue a principled path.": "伊斯特瓦尔相信英雄是能够点燃他人正义之火的火花，是驱赶邪恶黑暗的光芒。看到冒险者身上的这种火花，使圣骑士成为党在沃特德普议会最有力的支持者之一，只要他们追求有原则的道路。",
	"Sir Isteval has much in common with {@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ} of the Order of the Gauntlet. The two are potential allies in all things, which worries some of the other Lords' Alliance members.": "伊斯特瓦尔爵士与高塔骑士团的（%0%）有很多共同点。两人在所有事情上都是潜在的盟友，这让其他一些领主联盟的成员感到担忧。",
	"The Zhentarim—also known as the Black Network—is a loose affiliation of merchants, mercenaries, and malefactors. Common folk know the Zhentarim as the people to talk to when you need the best guards or mercenaries money can buy. And if the cargo is shady or the cause you're fighting for is questionable or even unjust, the Zhentarim don't mind.": "Zhentarim--也被称为黑网--是一个由商人、雇佣兵和恶棍组成的松散联盟。普通人都知道，当你需要用钱买到最好的警卫或雇佣兵时，可以和Zhentarim谈谈。如果货物有问题，或者你为之奋斗的事业有问题，甚至是不公正的，Zhentarim也不会介意。",
	"Affiliation with the Zhentarim can be profitable to sellswords, thieves, and rogues of every stripe. It's plausible that adventurers in your campaign might become members of the organization—but like most residents of Faerûn, they won't know the full extent of the Zhentarim's operations and goals.": "隶属于Zhentarim的组织对各种类型的卖家、盗贼和流氓来说都是有利可图的。在你的活动中，冒险者有可能成为该组织的成员，但就像法鲁恩的大多数居民一样，他们并不了解Zhentarim的全部活动和目标。",
	"Unknown to all but a few, the heart of the Zhentarim is a cabal of evil and sometimes monstrous leaders who seek to extend the Black Network's blood-soaked reach into every assassination, black market, and illegal deal that happens in Faerûn. The order's criminal connections burrow into every major city and thieves' guild in the Western Heartlands and along the Sword Coast. Wherever a city's coinage is disastrously undermined by counterfeiting, wherever an up-and-coming business runs roughshod over its established competitors, and wherever a political struggle turns to widespread intimidation, it's a safe bet that the Zhentarim are involved.": "除了少数人之外，根塔林的核心是一个由邪恶的、有时是畸形的领导人组成的阴谋集团，他们试图将黑色网络的血腥触角延伸到法鲁恩的每一次暗杀、黑市和非法交易中。该组织的犯罪关系深入到西部心脏地带和剑海岸的每个主要城市和盗贼公会。每当一个城市的钱币因造假而遭到灾难性破坏，每当一个新兴企业对其成熟的竞争对手采取粗暴手段，每当一场政治斗争演变成广泛的恐吓，都可以肯定根塔林会参与其中。",
	"However, engaging in mainstream corruption and wanting to see Tiamat ascendant are two different things. The Zhentarim have no illusions about what the Dragon Queen's return would mean for their plans. Wanting to secretly rule the world from the shadows for themselves, the leaders of the Black Network have no desire to become agents and errand-runners for some petty god and her dragon cohorts.": "然而，参与主流腐败和希望看到提亚马特登基是两件事。镇塔林对龙女王的回归对他们的计划意味着什么不抱幻想。想要从阴影中为自己秘密统治世界，黑网的领导人并不希望成为某个小神和她的龙族同伙的代理人和跑腿者。",
	"This viewpoint makes the Zhentarim an interesting addition to the characters' possible allies. Under normal circumstances, the Harpers, the Lords' Alliance, the Order of the Gauntlet, and the Emerald Enclave would shun ties to the Black Network—and possibly arrest its emissaries. However, the crisis created by the Cult of the Dragon is unprecedented. Every resource that can be mustered will be needed in the final showdown against the cult, and the Zhentarim's network of spies, assassins, and mercenary armies cannot be ignored.": "这种观点使赞塔林成为人物可能的盟友中一个有趣的补充。在正常情况下，哈珀人（Harpers）、领主联盟（Lords' Alliance）、高塔骑士团（Order of the Gauntlet）和翡翠飞地（Emerald Enclave）会回避与黑网的关系，并可能逮捕其使者。然而，神龙教造成的危机是空前的。在与该邪教的最后决战中，将需要每一种可以调动的资源，而镇塔林的间谍、刺客和雇佣军网络是不容忽视的。",
	"Even with the fate of the world and the Zhentarim's own future hanging in the balance, the order demands payment for services—and where need and risk are greatest, the pay is expected to be equally great. This mercenary attitude does not sit well with the Lords' Alliance, however, and they are the only group with the resources to pay the Black Network's price. The heroes can attempt to sway the opinions of the other factions—and have a chance to buy the Zhentarim's allegiance outright in the follow-up to {@adventure chapter 15|RoT|6}.": "即使世界的命运和Zhentarim自己的未来都岌岌可危，该组织仍要求为服务付费--在需求和风险最大的地方，报酬也会同样巨大。然而，这种雇佣兵的态度让领主联盟很不满意，他们是唯一有资源来支付黑网代价的团体。英雄们可以尝试动摇其他派别的意见--并且有机会在后续的{@adventure chapter 15|RoT|6}中直接买下赞塔林的效忠。",
	"In the end, too much is at stake to sit this fight out, and the Zhentarim pitch in against the cult regardless of whether their price is paid. However, if the other factions want a voice in how the Zhentarim go to war against the cult, it will cost them. If the Zhentarim fight on their own, they strike when and how they choose.": "最后，这场战斗的利害关系太大了，无论是否付出代价，Zhentarim都会投向邪教。然而，如果其他派别想在根塔林人如何与邪教开战的问题上有发言权，他们就会付出代价。如果Zhentarim独立作战，他们会在自己选择的时间和方式上进行打击。",
	"At least one Black Network mission is carried out regardless of payment. Without the knowledge of anyone outside the Zhentarim, one of their agents has infiltrated the cult and gets close enough to Wyrmspeaker Varram to steal the {@i White Dragon Mask}. This theft sets off a sequence of events that culminates in Varram's portion of the \"{@adventure Death to the Wyrmspeakers|RoT|3}\" chapter.": "至少有一个黑网的任务是不计报酬地执行的。在镇塔林以外的人不知情的情况下，他们的一名特工潜入了邪教，并接近了Wyrmspeaker Varram，偷走了{@i White Dragon Mask}。这次偷窃引发了一连串的事件，在瓦拉姆的\"{@adventure Death to the Wyrmspeakers|RoT|3} \"章节中达到高潮。",
	"Black Network agents are useful NPCs that you can introduce at appropriate times during the adventure. Characters who played {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen} have already met one member of the Black Network—the female gnome {@creature Jamna Gleamsilver|HotDQ}. If the characters need information or gear they can't obtain any other way, seeking out or being approached by a Zhentarim agent is an easy way for you to provide it.": "黑网特工是有用的NPC，你可以在冒险过程中的适当时候介绍他们。玩过{@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen}的角色已经见过黑网的一个成员--女地精（%1%）。如果角色需要他们无法通过其他方式获得的信息或装备，寻找或被一个Zhentarim特工接近是你提供信息的一个简单方法。",
	"A typical Black Network agent is a highly capable adventurer with no scruples. Some Zhentarim have winged snake companions that carry messages on scrolls as they fly, allowing agents to keep in contact with one another.": "一个典型的黑网特工是一个能力很强的冒险家，没有任何顾忌。一些真塔林人有带翅膀的蛇伙伴，它们在飞行时将信息写在卷轴上，使特工们能够保持彼此的联系。",
	"Although the Zhentarim as a whole oppose the cult's plans, not everyone in the Black Network shares that view. A number of Zhentarim agents believe that the cult's victory is inevitable, and that by standing against the cult, the Zhentarim risk losing everything. If events are going too smoothly for the heroes, you can introduce a few rogue Black Network agents to throw a wrench into the characters' plans at the worst possible moment.": "虽然根塔林作为一个整体反对邪教的计划，但在黑色网络中并不是每个人都赞同这种观点。一些Zhentarim特工认为，邪教的胜利是不可避免的，如果站在邪教的对立面，Zhentarim有可能失去一切。如果事件对英雄们来说太顺利了，你可以引入几个流氓黑网特工，在最糟糕的时刻给人物的计划带来麻烦。",

However, neither she nor Lord Neverember try to deny or conceal that affiliation if the characters question why Rian is present.": "里安是根塔林的成员，也是黑网在第三届沃特德普议会中的特使。她作为纽文伯领主的特别顾问坐在会议桌前，她与根塔林的关系不会被提及。然而，如果角色们质疑里安的存在，她和纽文伯领主都不会试图否认或隐瞒这种关系。",
	"The Black Network backs any plans that increase the likelihood of defeating the cult. Any and all alliances are fine, as are any outcomes that add to the council's strategic resources. Rian doesn't have any particular interest in morality, and dark acts have no impact on her attitude toward the party. She disapproves of taking any wyrmspeakers alive, though, fearing the power of such dangerous figures and questioning the chance of success for attempts to turn or interrogate them. She favors discreet execution, interrogation of the corpse with appropriate rituals, and destruction of the body to prevent resurrection.": "黑网支持任何增加击败邪教的可能性的计划。任何和所有的联盟都没有问题，任何能增加理事会战略资源的结果也是如此。里安对道德没有任何特别的兴趣，黑暗行为对她对党的态度没有任何影响。但她不赞成活捉任何讲巫术的人，因为她害怕这种危险人物的力量，并对试图策反或审讯他们的成功率表示怀疑。她倾向于谨慎地处决，用适当的仪式审问尸体，并销毁尸体以防止复活。",
	"The Black Network remains uncommitted until the final council when pledges are made. If the party has earned the Zhentarim's respect, they provide their services at only a nominal cost. However, such action almost certainly alienates most of the other factions from the adventurers. Unlike the other factions, the Zhentarim's loyalty can be purchased regardless of their respect for the characters, if the party can negotiate terms to be paid by the other factions.": "黑网在最后的议会上作出承诺之前，一直没有作出承诺。如果队伍赢得了赞塔林的尊重，他们只需付出象征性的代价就能提供服务。然而，这样的行动几乎肯定会使大多数其他派系与冒险者疏远。与其他派别不同的是，不管他们对角色的尊重程度如何，如果党派能够谈判出由其他派别支付的条件，那么就可以买到Zhentarim的忠诚度。",
	"The good dragons of Faerûn hear the {@i Draakhorn's} call and know what it portends.

	"The metallic dragons will strike against the cultists at the Well of Dragons, but they are much more effective if their attacks are coordinated as part of the overall plan of battle.

Even when good giants see the need and wisdom in joining forces with lesser folk, they often resist the idea out of pride until someone or something can command their respect.": "虽然很多巨人都投靠了龙之教，但大多数人对古代龙-巨人战争的记忆是痛苦和仇恨的。关于仇杀、流血和死亡的故事加剧了巨人对龙的仇恨，但巨人种族是他们自己的主人。因此，他们不轻易与小种族合作。即使善良的巨人看到了与小民族联合的必要性和智慧，他们也常常出于骄傲而抵制这种想法，直到有人或事能得到他们的尊重。",
	"Engaging the giants in an alliance against the Cult of the Dragon can be handled by NPCs (most likely by members of the Harpers or the Emerald Enclave). If the characters completed {@i Hoard of the Dragon Queen} in possession of Skyreach Castle, offering to return it to the giants (either behind the scenes or in a side trek chapter of your own creation) is sure to guarantee their support of the factions against the Cult of the Dragon.

The raiders haven't set up an effective cordon around the keep, so it's still possible to move through the front gate—but not for long.": "除非有角色介入，否则哥布林会认为这些角色是邪教分子而不理会他们。假设角色介入并救出了那家人，利南解释说他们必须去守卫（在1号区域）；那是格林斯特唯一安全的地方。袭击者还没有在堡垒周围设置有效的警戒线，所以仍有可能通过前门移动，但时间不会很长。",
	"To reach the keep, the characters must make it past three groups of raiders. A group consists of {@dice 1d6} {@creature Kobold||kobolds} and {@dice 1d4} {@creature Cultist||cultists}. If the group contains six kobolds, one is a {@creature Winged Kobold||winged kobold (urd)}.": "为了到达守卫，人物必须穿过三组突袭者。一组由（%0%）（%1%）和（%2%）（%3%）组成。如果这群人中有六个哥布林，其中一个就是（%4%）。",
	"Characters can fight these enemies, sneak past them, retreat to avoid them entirely, or try something clever such as bluffing. If they fight, run the combat normally. When enemies must make a check to notice sneaking or bluffing, make a check with advantage for the group.": "角色可以与这些敌人战斗，偷偷溜过去，撤退以完全避开他们，或者尝试一些巧妙的方法，如虚张声势。如果他们战斗，则正常进行战斗。当敌人必须进行检查以注意到潜行或虚张声势时，请进行检查，并对团体有利。",
	"Each time the characters retreat from an enemy group to avoid it, they run into {@dice 1d6} more townsfolk who are trying to reach the keep. For every four additional townsfolk in tow, the group must move past one more enemy group to reach the keep.": "每当人物从一个敌群中撤退以避开它时，他们就会遇到{@dice 1d6}更多的镇民，他们正试图到达堡垒。每多拖四个老乡，队伍就必须多经过一个敌方队伍才能到达堡垒。",
	"At the keep, the characters are the last group through the gate before it is closed and barred. After characters enter the keep, raiders encircle it in increasing numbers.": "在堡垒里，人物是最后一批通过大门的人，然后大门就被关闭了，并设有栅栏。在人物进入堡垒后，突袭者以越来越多的数量包围了它。",
	"Besides earning experience points (XP) for raiders fought on the way to the keep, characters earn a bonus of 50 XP per nonplayer character (NPC) brought alive into the keep. Divide this bonus equally among the party members. Alternatively, if you are using the milestone experience rule, the characters reach 2nd level once they arrive at the keep.": "除了在前往堡垒的路上与突袭者作战可以获得经验值（XP）之外，角色们还可以为每个被活捉的非玩家角色（NPC）获得50XP的奖励。把这个奖励平均分配给党员。或者，如果你使用的是里程碑式的经验规则，那么角色一旦到达堡垒就会达到2级。",
	"Events in Greenest are divided into missions. Missions don't need to involve combat, but most do.": "在《最绿》中，事件被分为任务。任务不需要涉及战斗，但大多数都涉及。",
	"The characters reach the town at sundown, or about 9 p.m. The sun comes up again at 6 a.m. the next morning, but the last of the raiders are gone by 4 a.m.": "角色们在日落时分，也就是晚上9点左右到达小镇。第二天早上6点，太阳再次升起，但最后一批突袭者在凌晨4点前就走了。",
	"For time-keeping purposes, assume that each mission takes an hour. Time during the hour that isn't spent fighting or slipping through town is spent tending gear, bandaging minor wounds, patrolling the keep's walls, briefing Nighthill on the situation, and other mundane tasks. If characters take a short rest, they can't undertake any other mission that hour.": "为了记录时间，假设每次任务需要一个小时。在这一小时内，如果不是用于战斗或溜过城镇，就会用于照料装备、包扎小伤口、在堡垒的墙壁上巡逻、向奈特希尔介绍情况，以及其他平凡的任务。如果角色进行短暂的休息，他们就不能在那一小时内承担任何其他任务。",
	"If players need guidance, Governor Nighthill can give the characters a quick briefing on the tactical situation. The raiders have isolated the keep from the town with encircling groups of guards, but they haven't organized an attack. Nighthill thinks the raiders don't intend to attack the keep; they seem interested only in loot. The real danger is to the town and to those people who didn't make it into the keep before it was cut off. Nighthill wants the characters to slip back into the town and help people who are cut off or harass the raiders. A stealthy group can make it out of the keep and back in again without drawing the raiders' attention.": "如果玩家需要指导，奈特希尔总督可以给人物快速介绍一下战术情况。袭击者已经用包围的卫兵群将堡垒与城镇隔离开来，但他们还没有组织进攻。Nighthill认为突袭者并不打算攻击堡垒；他们似乎只对战利品感兴趣。真正的危险是对镇子和那些在被切断之前没能进入堡垒的人。Nighthill希望角色们能溜回镇上，帮助那些被切断的人或骚扰突袭者。一个隐蔽的团队可以在不引起突袭者注意的情况下，走出堡垒并再次返回。",
	"A narrow tunnel runs from the cellar beneath the keep to the bank of the stream (area 2). The tunnel is wide enough to allow warriors to pass through it in single file. In the keep, the tunnel is sealed with a locked ironbound door, and the stream exit is covered with a locked iron grate made to look like a sewer outlet. The tunnel's main function was as a secret means of collecting water from the stream during a siege, but it can double as a sally port. Since the keep has never been besieged, the old tunnel has never been used. Barrels and crates are piled in front of the door. The keys for the locks are on the ring that Escobert carries with him everywhere.": "一条狭窄的隧道从堡垒下面的地窖一直延伸到溪流的岸边（2区）。这条隧道足够宽，可以让战士们单枪匹马地通过。在堡垒里，隧道被一扇上了锁的铁门封住，而溪流的出口则被一个上了锁的铁栅栏覆盖，看起来就像一个下水道的出口。这条隧道的主要功能是在围攻期间从溪流中收集水的秘密手段，但它也可以作为集水口。由于该堡垒从未被围攻过，所以这条老隧道也从未被使用过。桶和板条箱堆在门前。锁的钥匙在埃斯科贝特随处携带的戒指上。",
	"At some point, Escobert recommends the tunnel as a means of sneaking townsfolk into the keep without running the gauntlet of attackers watching the gates.": "在某种程度上，埃斯科贝特建议将隧道作为一种手段，让镇民们偷偷进入堡垒，而不需要跑到看守大门的攻击者面前。",
	"Characters can clear the cellar door with a few minutes' work. The lock is stiff but opens with the key; without the key, the character can open the lock with a successful DC 10 Dexterity check and a set of {@item thieves' tools|PHB}.

The rats attack when disturbed, and the surviving rats flee when half their number die.": "角色可以通过几分钟的努力来清理地窖的门。锁是僵硬的，但用钥匙可以打开；如果没有钥匙，角色可以通过成功的DC10灵巧检查和一套（%0%）来打开锁。这条废弃的隧道被网堵住了，但其他方面都很清楚。在溪流尽头的几码内，有一个由两只（1%）组成的巢穴。老鼠在受到干扰时就会攻击，而幸存的老鼠在死了一半后就会逃走。",
	"Years of exposure and neglect have corroded the lock on the exit grate. Even with the key, a successful DC 10 Dexterity check is needed to open the lock. Without the key, the DC increases to 20. If the roll misses by 5 or more, the key or {@item thieves' tools|PHB} break off in the lock so that unlocking it becomes impossible. Then only a successful DC 15 Strength check can force the grate open.": "多年的暴露和忽视使出口栅栏上的锁被腐蚀了。即使有钥匙，要打开这把锁也需要成功的DC10灵巧检查。如果没有钥匙，DC会增加到20。如果检查结果差5分或更多，钥匙或{@item thieves' tools|PHB}在锁中断裂，这样就无法开锁了。然后，只有成功地进行DC15力量检查才能强行打开栅栏。",
	"A group of cultists is searching the stream banks for hiding townsfolk when the characters emerge from the tunnel. If characters open the lock with the key or with {@item thieves' tools|PHB}, the first one to exit notices the raiders approaching without being spotted in return; the characters can keep out of sight in the tunnel or try to ambush the raiders after they pass. If the check fails, the raiders spot the character; roll initiative and proceed with combat. If the grate had to be broken open with a Strength check, the raiders hear the noise and find cover; they wait for the characters to exit the tunnel, then gain a surprise round. The raiders' group consists of two {@creature Cultist||cultists} and six {@creature Kobold||kobolds}. If any cultists are still alive at the beginning of the fourth round of the fight, one of them runs to fetch help. Ten minutes later, two {@creature Cultist||cultists}, ten {@creature Kobold||kobolds}, and one {@creature ambush drake|HotDQ} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}) arrive to guard the tunnel.": "当人物从隧道中走出来时，一群邪教徒正在河岸上搜寻躲藏的镇民。如果角色用钥匙或用{@item thieves' tools|PHB}打开锁，第一个出来的人就会注意到突袭者正在接近而不被发现；角色可以在隧道里保持不被发现，或者在突袭者通过后尝试伏击他们。如果检查失败，突袭者就会发现该角色；滚动主动权并进行战斗。如果必须用力量检查打开栅栏，突袭者会听到声音并找到掩体；他们等待角色离开隧道，然后获得一个突袭回合。突击队员的队伍由两个（1%）和六个（2%）组成。如果在第四轮战斗开始时有邪教徒还活着，其中一个人就会跑去求救。十分钟后，两个（%3%）、十个（%4%）和一个（%5%）（见（%6%））来到这里，守住通道。",
	"Award standard XP for defeated foes. Aside from that, the chief reward for this mission is the tunnel itself. As long as it remains secret, characters can use it to enter and exit the keep safely.

	"The keep has a sally port along the west wall for counterattacking foes who bring a battering ram against the gates. During the night while characters are in the keep, raiders approach the old gate, force it open, and rush through. Escobert discovers them and races into the courtyard to sound the alarm ahead of the infiltrators.": "堡垒的西墙有一个紧急通道，用于反击那些用撞锤撞门的敌人。夜里，当人物在堡垒中时，突袭者接近老门，强行打开，然后冲了进去。埃斯科贝尔发现了他们，并跑到院子里，在潜入者面前拉响了警报。",
	"Enough defenders are available to deal with the immediate threat from raiders loose in the keep, since it's more a probe that got out of hand rather than a full-scale assault. Escobert is most concerned about resealing the sally port, and he seeks out the characters for that job.": "有足够的守卫者来处理来自守卫中松散的袭击者的直接威胁，因为这更像是一次失控的探测，而不是一次全面的攻击。埃斯科贝特最关心的是重新密封集散港，他找来了负责这项工作的人物。",
	"To secure the sally port, characters must battle through two groups of foes. The first fight occurs against three {@creature Acolyte||acolytes}, three {@creature Kobold||kobolds}, and one {@creature ambush drake|HotDQ} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}), which are guarding the sally port's 10-foot-by-20-foot ready room against exactly this type of counterattack. After characters seize the room, they discover that the door is heavily damaged. The fastest repair is with five castings of {@spell mending} (taking five minutes). If none of the characters can do this, an NPC in the keep knows the cantrip. Someone must find and fetch her to the ready room.": "为了确保集结港的安全，角色必须与两组敌人作战。第一场战斗的对手是三个（%0%）、三个（%1%）和一个（%2%）（见（%3%）），他们守卫着传送门的10英尺×20英尺的准备室，正是为了防止这种类型的反攻。角色占领房间后，发现门被严重损坏。最快的修复方法是施放五次{@spell mending}(需要5分钟)。如果没有一个角色能做到这一点，那么堡垒里的一个NPC知道这个咒语。必须有人找到并把她带到准备室。",
	"Before the door can be repaired, a second group of raiders consisting of two {@creature Guard||guards}, three {@creature Cultist||cultists}, and three {@creature Kobold||kobolds} attacks.

	"Award standard XP for defeated foes.": "为被打败的敌人奖励标准XP。",
	"The {@creature adult blue dragon} Lennithon accompanied this raid but is not an enthusiastic participant. Its chief contribution has been its Frightful Presence, but that becomes less effective as the night wears on and defenders overcome their fear. Shortly before midnight, the dragon launches a final assault against the citadel. {@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ} orders the attack, knowing that the adventurers are in the keep at the time. Lennithon doesn't consider this to be its fight, and it isn't keen on tangling with adventurers for another's benefit.": "Lennithon{@creature adult blue dragon}伴随着这次突袭，但并不是一个热情的参与者。它的主要贡献是其可怕的存在，但随着夜幕的降临和守卫者克服恐惧，这一点变得不那么有效。午夜前不久，巨龙对城堡发起了最后的攻击。{@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ}下令进攻，他知道当时冒险者们都在堡垒里。伦尼森不认为这是它的战斗，它不热衷于为了别人的利益与冒险者纠缠。",
	"During this attack, Lennithon flies over the keep and uses his breath weapon without moving closer than 25 feet from the parapet. The defenders on the walls have mastered their fear of the dragon's Frightful Presence from earlier attacks. There are twenty NPC defenders on the walls at the beginning of the mission, and more can arrive between attacks to take the place of those who fall. The dragon doesn't target the adventures at first, and every breath attack not directed at them kills {@dice 1d4} NPC defenders and injures {@dice 1d6} more. Adventurers who happen to get caught in the area make normal saving throws and take standard damage. The NPCs' attacks are ineffective against Lennithon.

Inside, the main floor is dominated by a massive stone grinding wheel driven by a water wheel in the stream. The mill was operating late when the raid began and the millers fled without disengaging the wheel, so it still turns noisily. The upper half of the barn is a loft where milled flour is stored. The loft can be reached by wooden stairs along the east wall or by using the ropes and pulleys that hoist bags of flour up and down through large openings in the loft floor.": "磨坊是一个简单的长方形谷仓，大约40英尺长，20英尺宽，有一个附属的外部办公室。建筑物远离河流的长边有谷仓门和一个两扇门，两面短墙有窗户。所有这些开口都是封闭的，但没有一个是锁着或闩着的。在里面，主楼的主体是一个巨大的石磨，由溪流中的水轮驱动。袭击开始时，磨坊正在晚间运作，磨坊主没有解除水轮就逃走了，所以它仍然在嘈杂地转动。谷仓的上半部分是一个阁楼，存放着磨好的面粉。阁楼可以通过沿东墙的木质楼梯到达，或者利用绳索和滑轮将一袋袋面粉从阁楼地板上的大开口处吊上去和吊下来。",
	"The ambushers are waiting in the loft for heroes to enter the mill. When the heroes are inside, the guards launch a volley of spears from above, then leap down to fight hand-to-hand.

	"Group B consists of three {@creature Cultist||cultists}, ten {@creature Kobold||kobolds}, and two {@creature Ambush Drake|HotDQ|ambush drakes} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}) strung out in a mob that stretches 50 feet. This procession with leaping and whirling kobolds completes one circuit around the temple approximately every eight minutes (two minutes per side).": "B组由三只（%0%）、十只（%1%）和两只（%2%）（见（%3%））串成的暴徒队伍，绵延50英尺。这个带着跳跃和旋转的哥布林的队伍大约每八分钟绕着神庙完成一圈（每边两分钟）。",
	"Group C consists of four {@creature Cultist||cultists} and four {@creature Kobold||kobolds} clustered tightly around the temple's back door. Their meager fire produces little flame, instead creating prodigious clouds of thick smoke that engulf the back of the temple and blanket the surrounding 30 feet of ground. Everything in the smoke is lightly obscured, and objects or creatures that are seen through more than 15 feet of smoke are heavily obscured. Characters can sneak up on these raiders and gain a surprise round against them, as long as they avoid Group B in the process.": "C组由四个{@creature Cultist||cultists}和四个{@creature Kobold||kobolds}组成，紧紧地簇拥着寺庙的后门。他们微薄的火力几乎没有产生什么火焰，反而产生了巨大的浓烟云，吞没了寺庙的后面，并覆盖了周围30英尺的地面。烟雾中的一切都被轻度遮蔽，而透过15英尺以上的烟雾看到的物体或生物则被严重遮蔽。只要在这个过程中避开B组，角色就可以偷袭这些突袭者，并获得一个对他们的突袭回合。",
	"The heroes' best shot at rescuing the townsfolk is to overpower Group C and take control of the back door. In the temple, they can arrange a distraction to keep Groups A and B occupied at the front while the citizens of Greenest slip out the back and race for the keep or for the old tunnel—if characters have opened it already. That's only one possibility; clever players can come up with different solutions.": "英雄们营救镇民的最好办法是制服C组并控制后门。在神庙里，他们可以安排分散注意力，让A组和B组占据前门，而Greenest的市民则从后门溜走，争先恐后地去找堡垒或旧隧道--如果角色已经打开了它。这只是一种可能性；聪明的玩家可以想出不同的解决方案。",
	"The townsfolk in the temple are near panic, however, and they won't take orders from strangers unless someone makes a successful DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. Otherwise, characters need to locate the priest of Chauntea, Eadyan Falconmoon, a level-headed half-elf. He's easy to spot, being the only calm person they can find in the temple, and he is elated to see them. He looks to the characters for a plan.": "然而，神庙里的镇民近乎恐慌，他们不会接受陌生人的命令，除非有人成功地进行DC15魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查。否则，人物需要找到Chauntea的牧师，Eadyan Falconmoon，一个平头的半精灵。他很容易被发现，是他们在神庙中唯一能找到的平静的人，他看到他们时很高兴。他向这些人物询问了一个计划。",
	"Time is pressing. While characters are inside the temple, remind them of the booming blows of the battering ram against the front doors and the frightened townsfolk. How much time you allow before the doors burst open depends on your group. What's important is that players feel pressed. To create a sense of pressure, give the front doors 30 hit points and let each thud of the battering ram deal {@dice 1d6} bludgeoning damage. When the doors reach 20 hit points, they have cracks large enough to see through. At 10 hit points, the doors sag in their hinges. At 5, they could collapse at the next impact. How frequently you roll the die is up to you! One roll every 15–20 seconds is a good target for an average group. Be flexible, judge the players' level of tension, and don't let anyone relax.": "时间紧迫。当人物在神庙里时，提醒他们注意撞锤对前门的轰鸣声和受惊吓的镇民。在门突然打开之前，你允许多少时间取决于你的团队。重要的是，玩家要感到有压力。为了创造一种压力感，给前门30点命中率，让撞锤的每一次撞击都造成{@dice 1d6}重击伤害。当门的命中率达到20时，它们的裂缝大到可以看穿。在10点的时候，门的铰链会下垂。在5点时，它们可能在下一次撞击中倒塌。掷骰子的频率由你决定。每15-20秒掷一次骰子对于一个普通小组来说是个好的目标。要有灵活性，判断玩家的紧张程度，不要让任何人放松。",
	"If the doors burst open before the temple is evacuated, this scene turns into an ugly melee against Group A. The kobolds in that group prefer to attack unarmed villagers instead of lethal adventurers. Each kobold automatically kills one villager each round unless characters attack the kobolds, cut them off from their victims, or interfere some other way. If townsfolk have already evacuated the temple through the back door, or that process is well along before the front doors split apart under the ram, then characters can conduct a fighting withdrawal through the temple. After everyone gets into the smoke outside, they can close and brace the back door, then sprint for the keep or the tunnel in the stream bank with enough of a head start to get away safely.": "如果在寺庙被疏散之前大门突然打开，这个场景就会变成一场针对A组的丑陋混战。每个哥布林每回合自动杀死一个村民，除非角色攻击哥布林，切断他们与受害者的联系，或以其他方式进行干扰。如果村民们已经从后门撤离了寺庙，或者在前门被撞开之前，这个过程就已经开始了，那么角色们就可以通过寺庙进行战斗性撤退。在每个人都进入外面的烟雾中后，他们可以关闭并加固后门，然后冲刺到堡垒或河岸上的隧道，并有足够的先机来安全离开。",

Although it is shaped roughly like a human, it is at least seven feet tall, its skin is covered in blue scales, its fingers bear wicked claws, and its face has the muzzle and reptilian eyes of a dragon. The creature stops about eighty yards from the main gate of the keep and scans the walls. A line of kobolds fans out behind it. With their spears, they prod four human prisoners into the dim light. You can make out a woman, a teenage boy in a blood-soaked tunic, and two children. Then the half-dragon creature hails the keep.": "从黑暗中，一个生物大步走进堡垒周围垂死的火光中。虽然它的形状大致像人，但它至少有七英尺高，皮肤上覆盖着蓝色的鳞片，手指上有邪恶的爪子，脸上有龙的嘴和爬行动物的眼睛。这个生物在离守卫的大门大约八十码的地方停下来，扫视着墙壁。一排哥布林在它身后排开。他们用长矛把四个人类囚犯推到昏暗的光线中。你可以看清一个女人、一个穿着被血浸透的外衣的十几岁男孩和两个孩子。然后那个半龙人呼唤着守卫。",

	"Cyanwrath is pleased to see a champion step forward. He agrees to these terms for the combat: The three children will be set loose immediately, but his kobolds will continue to stand guard over the woman, and they will kill her if anyone interferes in the fight—for example, if archers in the keep let fly at him. Regardless of who wins, the woman will be released when the fight is over; and the victor will be the last one standing.": "西恩沃斯很高兴看到一个冠军站出来。他同意了这些战斗条款：三个孩子将被立即释放，但他的哥布林将继续守卫这个女人，如果有人干扰战斗，他们将杀死她--例如，如果守卫中的弓箭手向他放箭。无论谁赢了，战斗结束后，这个女人将被释放；胜利者将是最后站立的人。",
	"Governor Nighthill holds his troops in the keep during the combat. Adventurers can go out if they want, but the half-dragon insists that they keep their distance and stay between him and the fortress. If characters try to surround him or to edge into position for an ambush, he warns them that his kobolds won't hesitate to kill the hostages if they see signs of treachery. The half-dragon is evil, but he has a deep sense of honor about one-on-one combat. He doesn't intend any shenanigans, and he won't allow any from his kobolds.": "在战斗期间，奈特希尔总督把他的部队留在堡垒里。如果冒险者愿意，他们可以出去，但半龙人坚持要求他们保持距离，留在他和堡垒之间。如果角色们试图包围他或进入伏击位置，他警告他们，如果他的哥布林看到背叛的迹象，他们会毫不犹豫地杀死人质的。半龙人是邪恶的，但他对一对一的战斗有一种深深的荣誉感。他不打算做任何恶作剧，他也不允许他的哥布林做任何恶作剧。",
	"Cyanwrath is the likely winner of this match, whether he's fighting Sergeant Markguth or a character. When his foe drops, he strikes one more time; the last blow kills Markguth or inflicts one death roll failure on a character.

If by some mischance Cyanwrath is killed or captured, his place in the dragon hatchery ({@adventure chapter 3|HotDQ|3}) is taken by another half-dragon.": "Cyanwrath可能是这场比赛的赢家，无论他是与Markguth中士还是一个角色作战。当他的敌人倒下时，他再打一次；最后一击杀死马克古斯或对一个角色造成一次死亡卷轴失败。如果Cyanwrath在战斗中失败了，哥布林们会立即跳进去保护他的尸体并把它运走。(Cyanwrath会从他的伤口中恢复过来，并在以后再次遇到。)如果因为某种不幸，Cyanwrath被杀或被抓，他在龙族孵化场的位置({@adventure chapter 3|HotDQ|3})会被另一个半龙族取代。",

	"It's assumed that when characters first see the fighting in Greenest, they will rush to its defense. If they don't, and they're traveling with others, then the NPCs they're traveling with suggest that an immediate attack might turn the tide or at least save many lives. If characters still sit out this fight, they see about half of the attackers leave around midnight, with the rest retiring in small groups over the next few hours. When the sun comes up, even a quick inspection shows that over half of the buildings are heavily damaged and much of the town's wealth was carried away. Hundreds of injured people are crowded into the keep or are found hiding in cellars, but most of them will survive.": "我们假定，当人物第一次看到Greenest的战斗时，他们会赶去保卫它。如果他们不这样做，而他们又和其他人一起旅行，那么和他们一起旅行的NPC就会建议立即进攻，这可能会扭转局势，或者至少能挽救许多人的生命。如果人物仍旧坐视这场战斗，他们会看到大约一半的攻击者在午夜时分离开，剩下的人在接下来的几个小时里分批撤退。当太阳升起时，即使是快速检查也会发现，超过一半的建筑物被严重损坏，镇上的许多财富被带走了。数以百计的伤员被挤进守卫所，或被发现躲在地窖里，但他们中的大多数人都能活下来。",
	"In the warm light of day, Governor Nighthill and other leaders want to know who was behind the attack on Greenest, and why the town was a target.

	"Governor Nighthill approaches the characters with a proposal: If they locate the raiders' camp and find out certain information, he offers to pay them 250 gp apiece. He wants to know where the camp is sited, how many raiders are there, who their leaders are, what's motivating these attacks, and where they plan to strike next. If characters recover valuables that were stolen from the town, he would like them returned, but he does his best to arrange a reward from what's left of the town treasury. Recovering treasure, however, is a lesser goal when compared to the other objectives he brings up.": "奈特希尔总督向这些人物提出了一个建议。如果他们找到突袭者的营地并找出某些信息，他愿意支付他们每人250金币。他想知道营地的位置，那里有多少掠夺者，他们的首领是谁，是什么促使了这些袭击，以及他们计划在哪里进行下一次袭击。如果人物找回了从镇上偷来的贵重物品，他希望这些物品能被归还，但他会尽力从镇上国库剩下的钱中安排奖励。然而，与他提出的其他目标相比，追回财宝是一个较小的目标。",

	"The raiders' path is easy to follow across the rolling grassland of the Greenfields. A wide swath of grass is trampled down, but it's impossible to determine the raiders' numbers precisely. The path only confirms what characters already know: there were a lot of them, and they were a mix of humans, kobolds, and trained reptiles. One bit of information can be gleaned with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check: Many of the beasts' footprints are deeper on the retreat than they were on the approach march. They were weighed down with loot on the homeward-bound trip, but let players reach that conclusion on their own. It's not possible to tell from the confusing jumble of prints whether any specific footprints are those of prisoners.": "突击队员的道路在绿地的连绵不断的草地上很容易追踪。大片的草地被践踏，但不可能精确地确定突袭者的数量。这条路只是证实了人物已经知道的事情：他们有很多人，而且是人类、哥布林和受过训练的爬行动物的混合体。通过成功的DC15智慧（（%0%））检查，可以收集到一点信息。许多野兽的脚印在撤退时比在接近行军时更深。它们在归途中被战利品所拖累，但让玩家自己来得出这个结论。从混乱的脚印中无法判断是否有具体的脚印是囚犯的。",
	"The trail leads south about twelve miles, to a more rugged region where steep-sided, rocky plateaus replace the gently rolling hills. The land between the plateaus is largely flat, broken only by outcroppings and wandering streams in steep-sided gullies. The plateaus jut fifty to one hundred feet above their surroundings and are difficult to climb except where rock falls and subsidence created natural ramps. The crumbling sides of the plateaus are dotted with caves and tumbled boulder fields.": "这条小路向南走了大约12英里，来到一个更加崎岖的地区，这里陡峭的岩石高原取代了平缓的丘陵。高原之间的土地大体上是平坦的，只被陡峭的沟壑中的突起物和游荡的溪流所打破。高原比周围的环境高出50至100英尺，除了岩石坠落和沉降造成的天然坡道外，很难攀登。高原摇摇欲坠的两侧点缀着洞穴和翻滚的巨石场。",
	"Characters can have two encounters during this trip. The first is with a group of raiders who have straggled behind the main body. They are disorganized and quarrelsome, and they should be easy prey for alert adventurers. The second group is an organized rearguard watching specifically for pursuers from the town. They present a much graver threat.": "角色在这次旅行中可以有两次遭遇。第一次是与一群散落在大部队后面的突击队员相遇。他们没有组织，爱吵架，对于警觉的冒险者来说，他们应该是很容易的猎物。第二组是有组织的后卫，专门监视来自镇上的追兵。他们带来的威胁要严重得多。",

	"By observing for a few minutes, characters can discern that there are four human {@creature Cultist||cultists} and eight {@creature Kobold||kobolds} in the group. The kobolds and humans distrust each other, and although the cultists act as if they're the bosses, their leadership amounts to nothing more than ineffectual bullying. The humans' weapons are stacked against a rock, out of easy reach. The kobolds have their weapons on their belts.": "通过几分钟的观察，人物可以发现这群人中有四个人类（%0%）和八个（%1%）。哥布林人和人类彼此不信任，虽然邪教徒表现得好像他们是老大，但他们的领导力不过是无效的欺凌。人类的武器被堆放在岩石上，不容易拿到。哥布林人把他们的武器放在腰带上。",

	"If characters attack, then unless they give away their presence on purpose (by hailing the camp, for example), they gain a surprise round. The humans spend their first turns retrieving their weapons and shields. The kobolds drop their food and scatter, then regroup and counterattack on round four, using their slings as much as possible. They stick around and fight only as long as any of their human allies are still fighting. As soon as the humans are all defeated, the remaining kobolds slink away into the hills and aren't seen again.": "如果角色发动攻击，那么除非他们故意暴露自己的存在（例如呼唤营地），否则他们将获得一个突击回合。人类在第一轮中收回他们的武器和盾牌。哥布林扔掉食物，一哄而散，然后在第四回合重新集结并反击，尽可能地使用他们的弹弓。只要他们的人类盟友还在战斗，他们就会坚持战斗。一旦人类被打败，剩下的哥布林就会溜进山里，再也看不到了。",

They don't know how strong the rearguard will be, but they expect it is sited about a mile ahead where the path passes between rocky bluffs. They also can describe the raiders' camp and its location, plus they know some prisoners were taken from the town but not how many or whether they include a half-elf monk.

	"If the characters learn of the camp location and probable site of the rearguard from the stragglers, they can use that information to bypass this encounter entirely.

The best result for the characters is if the outpost checks in at the correct time with an \"all clear.\"": "如果角色们从散兵游勇那里得知了营地的位置和后卫的可能位置，他们就可以利用这些信息完全绕过这场遭遇战。事实上，这将是明智之举，因为这样可以避免一场破坏性的战斗，而且如果后卫被消灭了，邪教的领导人会想知道为什么他们从来没有回来报告。对人物来说，最好的结果是，前哨在正确的时间报到，\"一切正常\"。",
	"The rearguard consists of one {@creature veteran}, six {@creature Cultist||cultists}, and two {@creature Acolyte||acolytes}. The guard and cultists have spears for both ranged and melee combat. They are positioned in an area where the trail winds through a gap between two outcrops. The ambushers are hidden in the rocks, 12 to 15 feet above ground level.

	"If players state that they're watching for potential ambush spots, give them advantage when making these checks.": "如果玩家表示他们正在观察潜在的伏击点，那么在进行这些检查时，要给他们以优势。",
	"The rearguard has a twofold mission. It must stop any small party of intruders coming up the trail, or harass and delay a larger group while sending word to the camp that trouble approaches. The veteran decides that he has enough of an advantage against a party of five or six adventurers to deal with the problem on the spot, provided he doesn't weaken his force by sending a runner to {@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ}. If the adventuring group contains seven or more characters, you can either have the veteran harass the enemy and dispatch a runner to the camp, or you can add cultists until they outnumber the characters by two or three, then let the cultists make a stand.": "后卫有两方面的任务。它必须阻止任何小规模的入侵者走上山路，或者骚扰和拖延更大的队伍，同时向营地发出消息说麻烦正在靠近。老手决定，只要他不派跑腿的人去（%0%），他对五六个冒险者的队伍有足够的优势，可以当场处理问题。如果冒险团包含七个或更多的角色，你可以让老兵骚扰敌人，并派遣一个跑腿的人去营地，或者你可以增加邪教徒，直到他们的人数超过角色的两个或三个，然后让邪教徒们做出一个立场。",
	"If characters walk into the trap, the cultists tumble boulders onto them. Each character must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or take {@dice 2d12} bludgeoning damage from falling rocks (half as much damage on a successful save). The boulder attack constitutes the cultists' surprise round. After that, they use ranged attacks until they are out of ammunition or the heroes force them into melee. Because they are positioned in the rocks above the characters, the cultists have three-quarters cover against attacks from below (+5 bonus to AC). To reach the foes, characters must scramble up the rocks.

	"These raiders are distinctly different from the earlier stragglers. All are dressed in similar (but not identical) black leather tunics with flared, black mantles. These are dedicated cultists. If captured, nothing less than a successful DC 20 Charisma ({@skill Intimidation}) check can pry any information from them. Even with that, all they reveal is that they are initiates in the Cult of the Dragon, the names of their leaders ({@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}, {@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ}, and {@creature Langdedrosa Cyanwrath|HotDQ}), and that the raid on Greenest was to collect treasure for dragons. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} outranks the other leaders.": "这些突击队员与先前的散兵游勇明显不同。所有的人都穿着类似（但不完全相同）的黑色皮革外衣，披着黑色的斗篷。这些人是专门的邪教徒。如果被俘，除非成功地进行DC20魅力（（%0%））检查，否则无法从他们那里撬出任何信息。即使如此，他们也只能透露出他们是龙之崇拜的入门者，他们的领袖的名字（（%%1%）、（%%2%）和（%%3%）），以及对格林斯特的袭击是为了给龙收集宝藏。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}的地位高于其他领导人。",
	"Award standard XP for defeated foes. The cultists have no treasure, but their Cult of the Dragon outfits and weapons could be invaluable when characters try to get into the raiders' camp.": "为被击败的敌人奖励标准XP。邪教徒没有财宝，但是当人物试图进入突袭者的营地时，他们的神龙教服装和武器可能是无价之宝。",
	"The cultists have set up their camp in the hollow of a rocky plateau that's shaped roughly like a horseshoe. The lower portion of the plateau rises gently from the surrounding land, but it quickly steepens and ascends to a height of 150 feet above the landscape.

	"The cultists have built two guard towers at the camp, one at the entrance to the hollow and one atop the plateau. These towers are 20 feet high and made from rough timbers lashed together with rope. They are large enough for a few lookouts. The tower at the mouth of the hollow is manned by kobolds, while warriors man the one above. The guards have horns to blow when they must sound an alarm.": "邪教分子在营地建造了两座守卫塔，一座在空地的入口处，一座在高原之上。这些塔楼有20英尺高，由粗糙的木头用绳子捆绑而成。它们足够大，可供几名瞭望员使用。洞口的塔由哥布林看守，而上面的塔则由战士看守。守卫有喇叭，当他们必须发出警报时可以吹响。",
	"The cultists' prisoners are kept at area 1. Currently, only eight prisoners are in the camp, not counting Leosin. During the day, they are put to work under guard by four {@creature Dragonclaw|HotDQ|dragonclaws} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}). At night, they are shackled to a post in their hut to prevent escape. The shackles are secured by a single chain and lock that can be opened with a key carried by one of the guards or with thieves' tools and a successful DC 10 Dexterity check. The chain can be broken with a successful DC 20 Strength check. Five of the prisoners are from Greenest, and the other three are from earlier raids against hamlets and small farming villages to the south and east. There were more prisoners at one time, but many have died from overwork and mistreatment.

	"The sides of the plateau rise sharply, while the floor of the hollow slopes up gradually toward the east. A long ladder is lashed to the cliff so guards can reach the upper guard tower.": "高地的两侧急剧上升，而空洞的地面则逐渐向东倾斜。一条长梯被绑在悬崖上，以便守卫可以到达上面的警卫塔。",
	"The cliffs have handholds and footholds for climbing, so no die roll is needed under normal circumstances. If characters are in a hurry, a successful DC 10 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check is needed to make the climb without falling. If characters are concerned about keeping quiet, then a successful DC 10 Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check ensures that no rocks break loose and rattle down.": "悬崖上有用于攀爬的手掌和脚掌，所以在正常情况下不需要掷骰子。如果人物很匆忙，则需要成功地进行DC 10力量（（%0%））检查，以便在攀登过程中不掉下去。如果人物担心保持安静，那么需要成功地进行DC10灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）检查，以确保没有岩石松动和响声。",
	"The raiders live in circular huts made from closely spaced wooden or bone poles covered in hide, mud, and sod. Huts vary in diameter from 10 feet to 25 feet, and in height from 5 feet to 10 feet. (Symbols on the map represent clusters of tents.) Those in the mouth of the hollow (level 1 on the map) are crudely built and decorated with animal skulls. These are occupied by kobolds. Cultists occupy the huts on level 2, which are sturdier, cleaner, and decorated with painted designs representing dragons. A few tents on level 2 are set aside for prisoners.": "袭击者住在圆形的小屋中，这些小屋由密密麻麻的木杆或骨杆制成，上面覆盖着兽皮、泥土和草皮。小屋的直径从10英尺到25英尺不等，高度从5英尺到10英尺。(地图上的符号代表帐篷群。）那些位于空洞口的帐篷（地图上的第一层）建造得很简陋，用动物头骨装饰。这些帐篷是由哥布林占据的。崇拜者占据了第二层的小屋，这些小屋更坚固，更干净，并装饰有代表龙的绘画图案。第二层的几个帐篷是为囚犯准备的。",

	"For the first day following the raid, the cultists are both elated with the outcome and exhausted. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} doesn't expect a serious challenge from the town, and slower members of the raiding party and walking wounded straggle into camp all through the day after the raid. The situation at the camp is confused and security is lax. Most of these raiders are mercenaries and bandits, and not even the dedicated cultists wear recognizable uniforms on raids. No one challenges latecomers for passwords or security signals. Put simply, the raiders are confident that no enemies followed them this far. Characters can walk straight into the camp without having their identities seriously challenged. In fact, the bolder they are, the more likely they are to blend right in.": "在突袭后的第一天，邪教徒们既对结果感到欣喜，又感到疲惫。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}没有想到镇上会有严重的挑战，突击队中速度较慢的成员和行走的伤员在突击后的一天里都在大摇大摆地进入营地。营地的情况很混乱，安全也很松懈。这些突袭者大多是雇佣兵和强盗，甚至连专职的邪教人员在突袭时也不穿可识别的制服。没有人向迟到的人挑战密码或安全信号。简单地说，突击队员们确信没有敌人跟到这么远。角色可以直接走进营地，而不会受到身份的严重质疑。事实上，他们越是大胆，就越有可能直接混进去。",
	"Players may be tempted to have characters seek cover and observe during the day and not attempt to enter the camp until nightfall. This can work, too, but sneaking around in the dark is more likely to attract suspicion than simply walking in as if they belong in the camp.": "玩家可能会想让角色在白天寻找掩护和观察，直到夜幕降临才试图进入营地。这也是可行的，但在黑暗中偷偷摸摸地走，比简单地走进去，好像他们属于这个营地，更容易引起怀疑。",
	"The chief risk is that someone might recognize the characters from the fighting at Greenest. Have each character make a DC 5 Charisma check. Success means no one remembers the character's face, but failure means that at some time (not necessarily immediately, but when recognition would be the most dramatic), someone in the camp recognizes the character. If characters are wearing Cult of the Dragon regalia taken from the rearguard, the characters have disadvantage on this roll because no one returning to camp at this time should be in uniform. The character who faced Cyanwrath one-on-one, however, has a -4 penalty to the roll. If that character ever comes face-to-face with the half-dragon, recognition is automatic.": "主要的风险是，有人可能会从Greenest的战斗中认出这些人物。让每个角色做一个DC 5的魅力检查。成功意味着没有人记得这个角色的脸，但失败意味着在某个时候（不一定是立即，但在认出的时候是最有戏剧性的），营地里有人认出了这个角色。如果角色穿着从后卫那里取来的神龙教的服装，那么角色在这个卷轴上有劣势，因为此时返回营地的人不应该穿着制服。然而，一对一面对Cyanwrath的角色，在这个卷子上有一个-4的惩罚。如果该角色与半龙人面对面，就会自动被认出。",
	"As the day wears on and the commotion winds down, the camp becomes calmer and better organized. Guards resume their normal routines. If characters haven't entered the camp before sundown of the first day, they find it more difficult, since there's very little traffic in and out of the camp on a normal day. They'll need a good story and a successful DC 10 Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check to walk past a guard station of five {@creature Guard||guards}. This check can be made only once for the group; they can't talk their way out of a failure. After the initial opportunity to enter the camp has passed, characters need to resort to stealth or subterfuge to get in. For example, characters scaling the plateau from the east could use brush for cover right up to where the cliff overlooks the camp. From there, they could observe or climb down the rocks under cover of darkness.": "随着时间的推移和骚乱的平息，营地变得更加平静和有组织。守卫们恢复了他们的正常生活。如果人物在第一天日落前没有进入营地，他们会发现更加困难，因为在正常情况下，进出营地的人很少。他们需要一个好的故事和成功的DC10魅力（（%0%））检查，才能走过一个五人（%1%）的警卫站。这个检定对这群人来说只能做一次；他们不能通过谈话来摆脱失败的命运。在进入营地的最初机会过去后，人物需要借助于隐身术或潜行术才能进入。例如，从东面爬上高原的人物可以利用灌木丛作掩护，一直到悬崖上俯瞰营地的地方。在那里，他们可以在黑暗的掩护下观察或爬下岩石。",
	"The whole camp goes on alert if the bodies of murdered human sentries or cultists are discovered. One dead kobold won't cause much alarm, but many dead kobolds will. If the camp goes on alert, every character must make a DC 15 Charisma check. A failure means the character has been spotted as a stranger and an infiltrator. Someone raises the hue and cry, which quickly draws a crowd. A roll of 10 or lower means someone has recognized the character from the fight in Greenest. The characters have a chance to get away if they immediately go on the attack and begin cutting their way out of camp, but if they delay or spin tales, a crowd of {@creature Cultist||cultists} that outnumbers them five to one surrounds them.": "如果发现被谋杀的人类哨兵或邪教分子的尸体，整个营地都会进入警戒状态。一个死亡的哥布林不会引起太大的恐慌，但许多死亡的哥布林会。如果营地进入警戒状态，每个角色都必须进行DC15魅力检查。失败意味着该角色已经被发现是一个陌生人和一个潜入者。有人提高了呼声，这很快吸引了一群人。10分或更低的分数意味着有人在Greenest的战斗中认出了这个角色。如果人物立即出击，开始切出营地，就有机会逃脱，但如果他们拖延或编造故事，就会有一群人数比他们多五倍的（%0%）的人包围他们。",
	"If characters try to estimate numbers in the camp, they count roughly one hundred kobolds and a mix of bandits, guards, and cultists totaling about eighty—effectively an unlimited supply if characters get the idea of fighting them all.": "如果人物试图估计营地里的人数，他们会发现大约有一百个哥布林和混合的强盗、卫兵和邪教徒，总数约为八十人，如果人物有与他们全部战斗的想法，那么实际上是无限的供应。",
	"If caught, characters are disarmed, their hands are tied, and they are brought before {@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ} for judgment. One by one, she asks them who they are, where they came from, and what they're doing in her camp.": "如果被抓到，人物会被解除武装，双手被绑，并被带到（%0%）面前接受审判。她一个一个地问他们是谁，从哪里来，在她的营地里做什么。",
	"If anyone was recognized from the fighting in Greenest, it doesn't matter what the characters say. Mondath sentences all of them to be executed on the morrow, after spending the night tied to posts alongside the monk Leosin. Characters have one night to escape this fate. They might wriggle out of their bonds, bribe or charm a cultist to set them free, or come up with a clever use for a cantrip. If all else fails, Leosin reveals that he has a hidden knife with which they can cut themselves free.": "如果有人在格林斯特的战斗中被认出，那么人物说什么都不重要。蒙达斯判处他们所有人在明天被处死，在与僧侣Leosin一起被绑在柱子上过夜。角色们有一个晚上的时间来逃避这个命运。他们可能会挣脱束缚，贿赂或施展魅力让邪教分子放他们自由，或者想出一个巧妙的法术用途。如果其他方法都失败了，Leosin会透露他有一把隐藏的刀，他们可以用它来解救自己。",
	"If characters admit they came from Greenest and are enemies of the cult, the effect is the same as if they'd been recognized.": "如果人物承认他们来自格林尼斯特，是邪教的敌人，其效果与他们被认出来一样。",
	"If characters lie to Mondath—claiming they are new recruits and this is all a mistake, for example, or that they are studying the cult before deciding whether to join—then compare their Charisma ({@skill Deception}) checks to Mondath's Wisdom check to determine whether she believes them. You can allow advantage or disadvantage on the roll when someone's lies are especially plausible or implausible. Match die rolls individually for every character. Those who Mondath believes are set free, but watched and stopped if they try to leave the camp. Those who Mondath does not believe are sentenced to die as above.": "如果角色对Mondath撒谎--比如说，声称他们是新成员，这都是个错误，或者说他们在决定是否加入之前正在研究邪教--那么将他们的魅力（{@skill Deception}）检查与Mondath的智慧检查进行比较，以确定她是否相信他们。当某人的谎言特别可信或不可信时，你可以在掷骰子时允许优势或劣势。为每个角色单独匹配掷骰子的次数。那些蒙达斯相信的人被释放，但如果他们试图离开营地，会被监视和阻止。那些蒙达斯不相信的人将被判处死刑，如上所述。",
	"Characters can learn much from poking around in the camp. If the characters pose as cult members, they can speak to other cultists and question them (carefully) about the cult's plans and long-term goals. Most cultists should be treated as indifferent when determining reactions or trying to gain a favor. Kobolds are less helpful and should be considered hostile when characters make Charisma checks to gauge their reaction.": "角色可以从营地里的打探中了解到很多东西。如果角色冒充邪教成员，他们可以与其他邪教成员交谈，并询问他们（仔细）关于邪教的计划和长期目标。在确定反应或试图获得好感时，大多数邪教人员应被视为无动于衷。哥布林的帮助较少，当角色进行魅力检查以判断他们的反应时，应被视为有敌意。",
	"Characters can learn the following information through observation and questioning. They need to be careful, however, not to attract attention for asking too many questions or poking their noses into things that are none of their business. Any time they come off as \"too nosy,\" feel free to call for another Charisma check to see whether someone recognizes them from Greenest.": "角色可以通过观察和询问了解以下信息。然而，他们需要小心，不要因为问太多问题或对与自己无关的事情刨根问底而引起注意。如果他们表现得 \"太爱管闲事\"，可以随时要求再做一次魅力检查，看看是否有人认出了他们来自格林斯特。",

	"In fact, it wasn't luck at all, at least not for {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}. Leosin had studied their previous attacks and concluded that the time was right for the cult to strike a bigger target, and he knew that Greenest was prosperous yet poorly defended, making it the most likely next target. So, when he deemed the time was just about right, he visited the town with the intent of staying until something happened. His observations paid off, and Leosin separated from his people during the night and fell in with the raiders when they retreated, hoping to learn more about the cult's plans and the location of their camp. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} spotted him after the sun came up, and the monk was quickly overpowered and captured.": "事实上，这根本不是运气，至少对（%0%）来说不是。Leosin研究了他们之前的攻击，并得出结论，邪教打击更大目标的时机已经成熟，他知道Greenest镇很繁荣，但防守却很差，这使它成为最有可能的下一个目标。因此，当他认为时机差不多的时候，他访问了这个小镇，打算在这里待到事情发生。他的观察得到了回报，利奥辛在夜里与他的人分开，并在突袭者撤退时落入他们之中，希望能了解更多关于邪教的计划和他们营地的位置。太阳升起后，{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}发现了他，这个和尚很快被制服并被俘。",
	"That portion of Leosin's scheme has worked reasonably well. He now knows most of the information listed above under \"Exploring the Camp.\" Unfortunately for him, captivity has been more brutal than he expected, and although his mind and will are still strong, he's in a very poor physical state.": "利奥辛的这部分计划取得了合理的效果。他现在知道上面 \"探索营地 \"项下所列的大部分信息。对他来说，不幸的是，囚禁比他预期的更残酷，虽然他的头脑和意志仍然很坚强，但他的身体状况非常糟糕。",
	"Despite the danger, Leosin isn't entirely happy about being rescued if characters come to set him free. He believes he can learn more, and he's willing to take the risk. He's too weak to resist, however, so characters can easily take him away against his will if that's what they want to do. He can move without aid at a speed of 20 feet and fights as a commoner with disadvantage on attack rolls. If characters don't bring him out of the camp, Leosin breaks away on his own. He refuses to talk about it later.": "尽管有危险，但如果有人物来解救他，Leosin并不完全高兴。他相信自己可以学到更多东西，他愿意冒这个险。然而，他太软弱了，无法抵抗，所以如果他们想这么做的话，人物可以轻易地违背他的意愿把他带走。他可以在没有援助的情况下以20英尺的速度移动，并以平民身份战斗，在攻击卷上处于劣势。如果人物不把他带出营地，Leosin就会自己挣脱。他后来拒绝谈论此事。",
	"If characters are captured and imprisoned alongside Leosin and their attempts to escape fall through, he reveals that he has a small knife hidden in his boot. They can use it to cut their bonds. Leosin's absence is noticed within five minutes if he is taken away, and an alarm goes up throughout the camp. Rigging up a dummy in his place delays the discovery by twenty minutes. Tying up a dead or {@condition unconscious} cultist (preferably a half-elf) in his place assures the intruders a two-hour head start before the escape is noticed.": "如果人物被抓，与Leosin一起被囚禁，而他们试图逃跑的努力失败了，他就会透露他的靴子里藏有一把小刀。他们可以用它来切断他们的束缚。如果Leosin被带走，他在五分钟内就会被发现，整个营地都会发出警报。在他的位置上装上一个假人，可以推迟20分钟被发现。在他的位置上绑上一个死人或（%0%）邪教徒（最好是半精灵），可以保证入侵者在逃跑被发现前有两个小时的时间。",
	"Award standard XP for defeated foes. This chapter does not involve many fights, but it does present many challenges, and characters should be rewarded for overcoming them. The awards listed below are just recommendations; adjust them and add to them as you see fit. Characters can reach 3rd level if they act prudently and capitalize on all the opportunities the camp offers, but it's not essential that they do.": "为被打败的敌人奖励标准XP。这一章的战斗不多，但确实提出了许多挑战，人物克服了这些挑战就应该得到奖励。下面列出的奖励只是建议，你可以根据自己的需要进行调整和补充。如果角色谨慎行事并利用营地提供的所有机会，他们可以达到第三级，但这并不是他们必须这样做。",
	"If you are using the milestone experience rule, the characters reach 3rd level when they complete this chapter.": "如果你使用的是里程碑式的经验规则，那么人物在完成本章时就达到了第三级。",
	"For getting into and out of the cultists' camp without causing an alarm or being caught: 100 XP per character.": "在不引起警报或被抓的情况下进出邪教组织的营地：每个角色100XP。",
	"For getting into and out of the cultists' camp without stirring any suspicion: an additional 100 XP per character.": "在不引起任何怀疑的情况下进出邪教分子的营地：每个角色增加100XP。",
	"For rescuing Leosin: 250 XP per character.": "因为救出了利奥辛：每个角色250XP。",
	"For leaving a dummy or decoy in Leosin's place: an additional 50 XP per character.": "对于在Leosin的位置上留下一个假人或诱饵：每个角色增加50XP。",
	"For rescuing other prisoners: 25 XP for each prisoner brought out of the camp alive.": "救出其他囚犯：每活着带出营地的囚犯有25XP。",
	"For each piece of information listed under \"Exploring the Camp\" that characters learn on their own (not from Leosin): 25 XP per character.": "在 \"探索营地 \"下所列的每一条信息，如果是人物自己学到的（不是从Leosin那里）：每个人物25XP。",
	"When the characters arrive safely back at Greenest—presumably with Leosin in tow—he can fill them in on any details they missed during their investigation of the cult's camp. The monks who accompanied him are delighted to see him alive, and the families of any other released prisoners are equally grateful for the return of their loved ones. Governor Nighthill pays the characters their promised 250 gp each and publicly praises their courage and daring.": "当人物安全地回到格林斯特时--估计是在Leosin的陪同下--他可以把他们在调查邪教营地时遗漏的任何细节都告诉他们。陪同他的僧侣们很高兴看到他还活着，其他被释放的囚犯的家人也同样对他们的亲人回来表示感谢。奈特希尔总督向这些人物支付了他们承诺的每人250金币，并公开赞扬他们的勇气和胆量。",
	"After his experience in captivity, Leosin needs several days to recover. When he's healthy again, he intends to travel north to Elturel to convey what he's learned to {@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}, a paladin of Torm who shares his concern over the Cult of the Dragon's recent surge in activity. He has a favor to ask of the characters.": "在被囚禁的经历之后，利奥辛需要几天时间来恢复。当他恢复健康后，他打算前往北方的艾尔图勒，将他所学到的东西传达给{@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}，这位托尔姆的圣骑士与他一样对龙之教最近的活动激增感到担忧。他有一个要求，就是请这些人物帮忙。",
	"\"After all you've done already for me personally and for the people of Greenest, I hate to ask anything more from you. But the need is great, and I dare to hope that you can aid me one time more. I need you to return to the cultists' camp. You know your way around it now. If the cultists are preparing to conduct another raid, or a large body of them marches away, or if anything substantial is carried into or out of that cave, I need to know. If you have a chance to get into the camp and look around again, that would be the ideal way to spot anything that's changed.": "\"在你已经为我个人和Greenest的人们做了那么多事之后，我不想再向你要求什么。但需求是巨大的，我敢于希望你能再援助我一次。我需要你回到邪教分子的营地。你现在知道怎么走了。如果邪教分子准备进行另一次突袭，或者他们中的一大批人行军离开，或者如果有什么实质性的东西被带进或带出那个洞穴，我都需要知道。如果你有机会进入营地，再看看周围，这将是发现任何变化的理想方式。",
	"\"I don't recommend letting yourselves get captured,\" he adds with a wry smile.": "\"我不建议让你们自己被抓，\"他狡黠地笑着补充道。",
	"If the characters were working as caravan guards, Leosin offers to match whatever their previous employer was paying them plus 20 percent. If they are currently unemployed, he offers them 150 gp apiece. He's willing to haggle; this mission is important, and no one else is available who Leosin believes can handle it. If the characters accept, he tells them to find him at the city of Elturel afterward, both to report and to collect their pay. If he has moved on before they reach the city, they can speak to the paladin {@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ} instead.": "如果这些人物以前是商队守卫，Leosin会提供与他们以前的雇主所支付的报酬相当的报酬，外加20%。如果他们目前没有工作，他就给他们每人150戈比。他愿意讨价还价；这个任务很重要，而且没有人可以让Leosin相信他能胜任。如果这些人物接受了，他告诉他们之后到Elturel城找他，既要报告又要领取报酬。如果在他们到达城市之前他已经离开了，他们可以和圣骑士（%0%）谈谈。",
	"The monk doesn't believe it's essential that the characters head back to the camp immediately. He doesn't expect the cultists to make any sudden changes in their plans or mode of operation. Leosin is wrong about this, because he doesn't realize how much his presence in Greenest alarmed the wyrmspeaker. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} knows that Leosin is investigating the Cult of the Dragon, but she doesn't know whether the monk's appearance in Greenest was a coincidence, a good guess, or a sign that the cult's whole plan has been compromised. She isn't willing to take chances: she's heading north with the accumulated treasure immediately.": "和尚认为人物立即返回营地并不是必须的。他并不指望邪教分子会突然改变他们的计划或行动方式。Leosin在这一点上是错误的，因为他没有意识到他在Greenest的出现让wyrmspeaker感到多么震惊。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}知道Leosin正在调查神龙教，但她不知道这个和尚在Greenest的出现是一个巧合，一个好的猜测，还是预示着神龙教的整个计划已经被破坏了。她不愿意冒险：她要立即带着积累的财宝向北走。",
	"When characters return to the camp area, they find it mostly abandoned. (If they stayed, they witnessed the rapid packing up and abandonment of the camp.) The stinking huts of the kobolds (those on level 1) have been burned, but the level 2 huts and both guard towers remain. Anyone can determine from tracks that the cultists trekked away in small groups in all directions. A successful DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check reveals that most of the camp's wagons and pack animals moved in a train toward the west.": "当人物回到营地区域时，他们发现营地大多被遗弃。(如果他们留下来，他们就目睹了营地的快速收拾和遗弃。） 臭气熏天的哥布林小屋（1层的那些）已经被烧毁，但2层的小屋和两个警卫塔还在。任何人都可以从足迹中判断出，邪教徒们分批向各个方向跋涉离开。成功通过DC10智慧({@skill Perception})检查可以发现，营地的大部分马车和驮运的牲畜都在一列火车中向西移动。",
	"Still left in the camp are some hunters, the kobolds who tend the dragon nursery in the caves, {@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ}, her guards, and {@creature Langdedrosa Cyanwrath|HotDQ}. Only the hunters still use the huts. All others live in the hatchery cave. The activity and guards around the cave mouth should be the top draw on the characters' attention.": "营地里还剩下一些猎人、在山洞里照看龙苗的哥布林、{@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ}、她的卫兵和{@creature Langdedrosa Cyanwrath|HotDQ}。只有猎人还在使用木屋。其他所有人都住在孵化室的洞穴里。洞口周围的活动和守卫应该是最吸引人物注意力的地方。",
	"On most mornings, hunters fan out onto the grassland to hunt for antelope and other large game. They travel on horseback and bring along an extra horse to pack the field-dressed game back to the camp. Hunters don't necessarily return to the camp every evening. They stay out until they have a load of meat to bring back. Hunting on the Greenfields is good, so they seldom need to spend more than a night or two away. Four {@creature Scout||scouts} act as hunters; roll a {@dice d4} to determine how many are in the camp when characters arrive. They are not dedicated cultists, so they won't challenge characters who enter the camp, attack them, or even alert the cultists. They consider standing guard to be beneath them.": "在大多数的早晨，猎人在草原上打猎，寻找羚羊和其他大型动物。他们在马背上行走，并带着一匹额外的马，把穿戴整齐的猎物带回营地。猎人不一定每天晚上都要回到营地。他们一直在外面，直到有一车肉可以带回来。绿原上的狩猎情况很好，所以他们很少需要在外面过一两个晚上。四个{@creature Scout||scouts}充当猎人；当角色到达时，掷一个{@dice d4}来决定有多少人在营地里。他们不是专门的邪教徒，所以他们不会挑战进入营地的人物，不会攻击他们，甚至不会提醒邪教徒。他们认为站岗是在他们之下。",
	"They are a taciturn bunch, so they won't be much help to inquisitive characters. They converse more freely with rangers, but to most strangers they merely nod, point, shake their heads, scowl, and utter one- or two-word answers. If characters converse with them, these hunters can relate how the camp dissolved within hours after the discovery of the captured half-elf's escape. Crates carried from the cave were loaded onto wagons or animals and hauled to the west. A few raiders remain in the cave: the Wearer of Purple (Mondath), the \"dragon-man\" (Cyanwrath), the better warriors, and the \"dragon-dogs\" (kobolds). As long as the cultists pay well for fresh meat, the trackers continue hunting for them. Whatever else the cave holds is none of their concern.": "他们是一群沉默寡言的人，所以他们对好奇的人没有什么帮助。他们与游骑兵交谈时比较随意，但对于大多数陌生人，他们只是点头、指点、摇头、皱眉，并说出一两个字的答案。如果人物与他们交谈，这些猎人可以讲述营地是如何在发现被俘的半精灵逃跑后的几个小时内解散的。从山洞里搬运出来的箱子被装上马车或牲口，拉到了西部。少数突袭者仍留在洞穴中：穿紫衣的人（Mondath）、\"龙人\"（Cyanwrath）、更好的战士和 \"龙狗\"（kobolds）。只要邪教徒们为新鲜的肉付出丰厚的代价，追踪者们就会继续为他们狩猎。不管洞穴里还有什么，都与他们无关。",
	"A thorough search of the camp takes about ten man-hours. Allow characters to make a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check after the first hour. A successful roll means the character realizes that while quite a bit of material has been left behind, it's all trash: cracked pottery, rusty knives, soiled clothing and bedding, cheap cookware, and wine that's gone to vinegar. Some of it might be of use to the people of Greenest who lost everything in fires, but it has no value as treasure.": "对营地进行彻底的搜索需要大约10个工时。允许角色在第一小时后进行智慧（（%0%））检查。成功的检查意味着角色意识到，虽然留下了相当多的材料，但都是垃圾：破裂的陶器、生锈的刀子、弄脏的衣服和被褥、廉价的炊具，还有已经变成醋的酒。有些东西可能对在火灾中失去一切的格林斯特人有用，但它没有作为宝藏的价值。",
	"The only thing of interest remaining in the camp is the cave itself (area 4 on the map of the camp), which characters can see from the camp. There, characters find the cultists who stayed behind, a clutch of dragon eggs, the special cadre of kobolds who tend the eggs—and the many traps the kobolds set to defend their home. These eggs are important to the cult, but they were deemed too near to hatching to be moved safely. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} left them with what she believed was an adequate guard force under {@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ} and {@creature Langdedrosa Cyanwrath|HotDQ}.": "营地里唯一有意义的东西是洞穴本身（营地地图上的第4区），角色可以从营地里看到它。在那里，角色们发现了留下来的邪教人员、一窝龙蛋、照顾龙蛋的特殊哥布林干部以及哥布林为保卫家园而设置的许多陷阱。这些龙蛋对邪教很重要，但它们被认为太接近孵化而无法安全移动。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}把它们留给了她认为是足够的护卫力量的{@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ}和{@creature Langdedrosa Cyanwrath|HotDQ}手下。",
	"Cavern ceilings are 15 feet high. Ceilings in the humans' chambers ({@area areas 11|0ce|x}, {@area 12|0d1|x}, and {@area 13|0d3|x}) are 10 feet high.": "洞穴的天花板有15英尺高。人类的房间（（%0%）、（%1%）和（%2%））的天花板是10英尺高。",
	"During daytime, areas {@area 1|0af|x} and {@area 2|0b0|x} are brightly lit, and areas{@area  3|0b1|x} and {@area 4|0b4|x} are dimly lit by outside light.

	"The caverns are filled with faint sounds: dripping water, scratching rodents, scrabbling lizards, wind moaning across the entrance. These normal underground sounds camouflage the clanks, thuds, coughs, and speech of the kobolds and cultists. Sound echoes well along the main chamber (areas 1–5), so a fight in any of these can be heard in the others. Elsewhere, normal sounds echo confusingly and are lost in the background noise. The sound of a scream carries a long distance, however, and the sound of a fight travels through 30 feet of tunnel and attracts attention if the fight lasts more than 3 rounds.": "洞穴里充满了微弱的声音：滴水声、啮齿动物的抓挠声、蜥蜴的抓挠声、风在入口处的呻吟声。这些正常的地下声音掩盖了哥布林和邪教徒们的叮当声、砰砰声、咳嗽声和说话声。声音在主室（1-5区）中回响良好，因此在其中任何一个区域的战斗都可以在其他区域听到。在其他地方，正常的声音回声很混乱，并在背景噪音中消失。然而，尖叫的声音可以传得很远，战斗的声音可以穿过30英尺的隧道，如果战斗持续超过3个回合，就会引起注意。",
	"Kobolds move freely through the caverns, going about their business. Characters have a chance to randomly encounter these wandering kobolds. Roll a {@dice d6} every time characters enter or re-enter {@area areas 3|0b1|x} to {@area 10|0c8|x}. On a roll of 1, monsters are present. Roll on the table to determine what they meet.

Be sure to make this roll before characters enter the area, because both groups have a chance to gain surprise.": "哥布林在洞穴中自由移动，做着自己的事情。角色有机会随机遇到这些游荡的哥布林。每次人物进入或重新进入{@area areas 3|0b1|x}至{@area 10|0c8|x}时，都要掷出{@dice d6}。掷到1时，怪物就会出现。在表格上滚动，以确定他们遇到的是什么。这些随机遇到的怪物会加到区域描述中提到的任何生物上。一定要在人物进入该地区之前进行这个掷骰，因为两组人都有机会获得惊喜。",
	"The entrance to the cave is broad and tall, but the ceiling quickly lowers to a height of 15 feet. Standing guard inside the entrance are two {@creature Dragonclaw|HotDQ|dragonclaws} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}). They position themselves about 30 feet inside the cave and stay near the walls and the column, so that while they aren't hidden, they aren't conspicuous, either. Characters who observe the cave from a distance—from the area of the plateau where the steps ascend from level 1 to level 2, for example—spot one of the dragonclaws.": "洞穴的入口宽阔高大，但天花板很快就降低到15英尺的高度。在入口处站岗的是两个（%0%）（见（%1%））。他们的位置在洞内约30英尺处，靠近墙壁和柱子，所以虽然他们没有被隐藏，但也不显眼。从远处观察洞穴的角色--例如从台阶从第一层上升到第二层的地方--发现了一只龙爪。",
	"If characters approach openly through the camp, the dragonclaws spot them automatically and retreat toward area 2 in the cave, to set up an ambush. If characters approach the cave quietly from the sides, they won't be spotted. They then have a chance to surprise the dragonclaws.": "如果角色公开地通过营地接近，龙爪会自动发现他们，并向洞穴中的2号区域撤退，以设下伏击。如果角色从侧面悄悄地接近洞穴，他们就不会被发现。这样他们就有机会给龙爪们一个惊喜。",
	"If the guards at the entrance spotted the characters' approach, they wait here until the characters come into view, then try to spring an ambush. Determine surprise normally.": "如果入口处的卫兵发现了人物的接近，他们就会在这里等待，直到人物进入视野，然后试图发动一场伏击。正常情况下，判断出奇制胜。",
	"The passage at the end of this alcove is deeply shadowed and hidden by a cleverly cut fold in the rock. It's obvious to anyone who walks to the end of the alcove, but from elsewhere in the cavern, it can be spotted only with a successful DC 20 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check.": "这个洞穴尽头的通道有很深的阴影，被岩石上巧妙切割的褶皱所隐藏。对任何走到洞穴尽头的人来说，这都是显而易见的，但从洞穴的其他地方，只有在成功通过DC20智慧({@skill Perception})检查后才能发现它。",

	"Nothing distinguishes the paths to casual inspection. The path on the right is flanked by four {@creature Violet Fungus||violet fungi}, while the path on the left is free of these dangerous growths. The violet fungi can be spotted among all the other mushrooms with a successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check, but only from the base of the steps, not from atop the ledge. Likewise, a careful inspection of the path reveals that only the left trail sees heavy use.": "没有任何东西可以将这两条路区分开来。右边的路两侧有四个{@creature Violet Fungus||violet fungi}，而左边的路则没有这些危险的植物。在所有其他的蘑菇中，只要成功地进行DC15智力（（%1%））检查，就可以发现紫色的真菌，但只能从台阶的底部，而不是从壁架的顶部。同样地，仔细检查这条路可以发现，只有左边的小路被大量使用。",
	"The stairs are constructed so that the lowest steps collapse into a ramp that dumps a character right at the base of the violet fungi. Roll any die as each character descends the steps; on an odd roll, the character triggers the trap.

The kobolds and guards know where to avoid stepping, of course.": "楼梯的构造是这样的：最低的台阶会坍塌成一个斜坡，将一个角色扔在紫罗兰真菌的底部。每个角色在下台阶时都要掷骰子；如果掷出奇数，角色就会触发陷阱。一个在楼梯上积极寻找陷阱的角色可以通过成功的DC15智慧（（%0%））检查找到被困住的台阶。当然，哥布林和守卫知道哪里可以避免踩踏。",
	"Some fungus from area 3 dots this area, but chiefly it is the lair of a colony of bats. Hidden among the bats are ten {@creature Stirge||stirges}.

Normally the stirges prey on the plentiful bats and leave the cave's other residents alone, but not always.": "第三区的一些真菌点缀着这个区域，但主要是一个蝙蝠群的巢穴。隐藏在蝙蝠中的有10只（%0%）。蝙蝠只在日出至日落时分出现，但海马总是在这里。通常情况下，海马捕食大量的蝙蝠，而不去管洞里的其他居民，但并非总是如此。",
	"Characters notice dead bats on the floor (victims of the stirges). If that causes someone to look up, describe how the ceiling is carpeted with bats with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. To avoid startling the bats, characters must proceed very quietly. This requires a successful DC 10 Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check. If three or more characters fail the check, the bats are alarmed by the noise, drop from the ceiling, and fly through the cavern in a blinding cloud of flapping and squeaking rodents. The bats present no danger, but their racket drowns out other noise and makes it impossible to see more than 5 feet. It also alerts the stirges, and the opportunistic bloodsuckers attack in the confusion. The stirges gain a +2 bonus to AC in the bat storm.": "角色注意到地板上的蝙蝠尸体（搅拌器的受害者）。如果这引起了某人的注意，可以用成功的DC 10智慧（（%0%））检查来描述天花板上是如何铺满蝙蝠的。为了避免惊动这些蝙蝠，人物必须非常安静地前进。这需要成功地进行DC10灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）检查。如果三个或更多的角色没有通过检定，蝙蝠就会被噪音惊动，从天花板上掉下来，并在一团耀眼的拍打和吱吱作响的啮齿动物中飞过洞穴。蝙蝠没有危险，但它们的喧闹声淹没了其他噪音，使人无法看到5英尺以上的地方。它也惊动了海燕，而这些投机取巧的吸血动物在混乱中发动了攻击。在蝙蝠风暴中，海蜇获得了+2的交流奖励。",

Along with normal sorts of refuse, such as broken pottery, rotted baskets, and mouse-chewed rope, they've also thrown out items that appear useful from a distance: discarded clothes, worn boots, tattered books, cracked lamps, and so forth. Some of these items came from prisoners who died, and others were taken in treasure raids and later deemed to be unworthy of Tiamat.

The strips are fixed to the ceiling and are long enough to drag on the floor. The curtain extends from wall to wall. The leather comes from a variety of local animals and is badly cured. The curtain is several layers thick with no gaps, so you can't see through it at all.": "在这些陡峭的下行台阶的底部，有一块帘子挂在通道上。它是由数百条沉重的皮条制成的，每条皮条大约有人手的宽度。这些皮条被固定在天花板上，长到可以拖在地板上。帘子从墙上延伸到墙上。皮革来自于当地的各种动物，并且经过了严重的腌制。帘子有好几层厚，没有缝隙，所以你根本看不透它。",
	"This cavern is naturally cold. It hovers a few degrees above freezing year round, regardless of the season. Much of the meat brought in by the hunters feeds the cultists and the kobolds, but the extra is stored here for eventual use when the dragon eggs hatch and the ravenous hatchlings emerge. The carcasses range from very fresh to several months old. The meat is only cold, not frozen, so the older items are slowly going bad.": "这个岩洞是自然寒冷的。无论什么季节，它全年都在冰点以上几度徘徊。猎人们带来的大部分肉都喂养了邪教徒和哥布林，但多余的肉被储存在这里，以便在龙蛋孵化和贪婪的幼龙出现时最终使用。尸体从非常新鲜到几个月大的都有。这些肉只是冷的，而不是冷冻的，所以老的东西会慢慢变坏。",
	"The smell of old blood assaults your nose. The floor is covered with dried puddles of it. Four floor-to-ceiling columns are spaced across the chamber, and chains have been strung between them like clothesline. Animal carcasses hang on hooks from the chains. You see gutted and skinned antelope, deer, goats, what might be big cats, and even a few small bears. Some of this meat has been here for a while if the smell is a reliable indicator.": "旧血的气味袭击了你的鼻子。地板上布满了干涸的水坑。四根从地板到天花板的柱子横跨整个房间，铁链像晾衣绳一样被串在它们之间。动物的尸体挂在铁链的钩子上。你看到被开膛破肚的羚羊、鹿、山羊、可能是大猫的东西，甚至还有几只小熊。如果气味是一个可靠的指标，这些肉有些已经在这里有一段时间了。",

	"A careful inspection of the leather strips coupled with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check finds barbs; they can't be noticed otherwise. When kobolds use this stairway, they bring the ruined spear that's kept in{@area  area 4|0b4|x}. With it, they sweep the leather strips to the left side of the corridor and wedge the end of the spear shaft into an angled socket in the floor just inside area 6. This holds the leather strips safely out of the way while they move in and out of the chamber.": "仔细检查皮条，再加上成功的DC10智慧({@skill Perception})检查，可以发现倒刺；否则就不会被发现。当哥布林使用这个楼梯的时候，他们会带上放在{@area  area 4|0b4|x}的废旧长矛。他们用它把皮条扫到走廊的左边，然后把矛杆的一端楔入6号区域内地板上的一个斜面插座。在他们进出密室的时候，这样可以将皮条安全地挡住。",

Every surface glistens with moisture, and the air is warm and humid. The flat walls of the chamber are decorated with shallow abstract carvings of dragons. Dragons' tails coil into intricate patterns and knots that flow across the walls. The creature portrayed in the northwest corner stands out: a five-headed dragon, rising from an erupting volcano. Other dragons, which seem dwarfed by the five-headed monstrosity, flock to its side. A small, wooden chest with silver and mother-of-pearl inlays sits on the floor in the corner, in front of the monstrous dragon carving.": "这个密室在原来的基础上进行了扩建和重塑。地板和三面墙壁都很光滑，钟乳石和石笋都被打磨成闪闪发光的柱子。每一个表面都闪烁着水汽，空气温暖而湿润。密室的平坦墙壁上装饰着浅浅的龙的抽象雕刻。龙的尾巴卷成复杂的图案和结，在墙壁上流动。西北角所描绘的生物非常突出：一条五头龙，从喷发的火山中升起。其他的龙，在五头怪兽面前显得相形见绌，纷纷涌向它的身边。角落里的地板上放着一个镶嵌着银色和珍珠母的小木箱，就在那条巨龙雕刻的前面。",

Inside are a string of pearls (300 gp), a gold-and-sapphire ring (900 gp), and a pouch containing a half-dozen masterfully cut and polished precious stones (100 gp each). The ring and the pearls were taken from Greenest and would be recognized by anyone from there, but the stones came from elsewhere and would be difficult to identify.

	"This chamber holds three eggs that {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} hoped to hatch into a new brood of dragons. They have not hatched yet but they will very soon, which is why {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} was unwilling to move them when the camp packed up and left.

	"The lower portion of the room (10A) is 15 feet below the ledge. Wooden steps have been built down to the lower floor. As in room 7, the steps are enclosed in a stout iron cage with a gate at the bottom. The key to the gate hangs on a wall peg opposite the top of the stairs.

	"Mixed in among the stalactites near the southeast corner of the room is an unusual {@creature roper} that can speak Common. It doesn't attack the kobolds or guard drakes because the kobolds feed it spoiled meat that the guard drakes won't eat. If attacked, it fights back (and it's very dangerous to 3rd-level characters!). It can reach anywhere in area 10 with its tentacles, and it can also move at speed 10. It is currently full and curious about strangers, however, so it's not averse to talking. Its only real concern is food. If told about the supply of meat in area 6 and brought some as proof, It leaves the characters along while it creeps away to investigate the larder.": "在房间东南角附近的钟乳石中混杂着一种不寻常的（%0%），能说普通话。它不攻击哥布林或护卫德拉克，因为哥布林喂它吃变质的肉，而护卫德拉克则不吃。如果被攻击，它就会反击（而且它对3级的角色非常危险！）。它的触手可以到达10号区域的任何地方，它也可以以10号速度移动。不过，它目前已经吃饱了，对陌生人很好奇，所以它不排斥说话。它唯一真正关心的是食物。如果被告知第6区有肉类供应，并带来一些作为证据，它就会把人物留在身边，而自己则悄悄地去调查储藏室。",
	"A total of three dragon eggs are spread throughout the area. Each is about three feet tall and weighs 150 pounds. Two of them are easy to spot just by walking through the room with a light source. The third is tucked into a pile of similar-colored stones behind one of the columns, making it easy to miss. When characters search the room, have everyone make a Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. Only a character who rolls 15 or higher notices the egg in its camouflaged nest. Looking at a dragon egg, a character can determine the color of dragon with a successful DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Nature}) check.": "共有三个龙蛋分布在整个地区。每一个都大约有三英尺高，重达150磅。其中两个只要在有光源的房间里走动就很容易发现。第三颗则藏在其中一根柱子后面的一堆类似颜色的石头里，很容易错过。当人物搜索房间时，让每个人都做一个智慧（（%0%））检查。只有掷出15分或更高分数的人物才会注意到在其伪装的巢穴中的蛋。观察龙蛋，角色可以通过成功的DC10智力（（%1%））检查来确定龙的颜色。",
	"If the eggs are left here, they hatch in less than a week. If they are taken away, whether they hatch depends on how they are stored and treated. Away from a warm, humid environment such as this chamber, their progress halts until they are again in a suitable incubator. The dragons can be killed easily if the eggs are smashed, crushed, or stabbed. If an egg is simply cracked open, the infant dragon struggles for breath, cries and squirms like a human baby for a few minutes, and then dies.": "如果鸡蛋被留在这里，它们在不到一周的时间内就会孵化。如果它们被带走，它们是否孵化取决于它们的储存和处理方式。离开了像这个房间这样温暖潮湿的环境，它们的进展就会停止，直到它们再次进入一个合适的孵化器。如果鸡蛋被砸碎、压碎或刺伤，龙就很容易被杀死。如果鸡蛋被简单地敲开，幼龙会挣扎着呼吸，像人类婴儿一样哭闹，蠕动几分钟，然后死亡。",
	"The floor of this area is about 10 feet below the ledge. The four {@creature Kobold||kobolds} who tend the eggs hid in this depression when they heard the fight break out in area 9. When characters approach within 25 feet of the ledge overlooking 10B (when they come in line with the top of the stairs to 10A), two kobolds toss glue bombs and the other two toss fire bombs. They do the same thing on the next round. Then they wait a round or two, if possible, while the roper in area 10A drags characters into its tentacles, bites them, or drops them 20 feet to the guard drakes.": "这个区域的地面比壁架低约10英尺。照顾鸡蛋的四个人（%0%）在听到第9区的战斗爆发时躲在这个凹陷处。当角色接近俯瞰10B的窗台25英尺范围内时（当他们与通往10A的楼梯顶端一致时），两个哥布林扔出胶水炸弹，另外两个扔出火焰炸弹。他们在下一回合做同样的事情。然后他们等待一两轮，如果可能的话，当10A区的罗布人把人物拖进它的触角，咬他们，或者把他们丢到20英尺外的守卫德拉克。",
	"Each creature within 10 feet of the bomb's target point must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or be {@condition restrained}. The target or another creature within reach of it can use an action to make a DC 11 Strength check; if the check succeeds, the effect on the target ends.": "炸弹目标点10英尺内的每个生物都必须在DC11灵巧判定中成功，否则会被（%0%）。目标或在其范围内的另一个生物可以使用一个行动来进行DC 11力量检查；如果检查成功，对目标的影响结束。",
	"Each creature within 10 feet of the bomb's target point must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or take 4 ({@dice 1d8}) fire damage (half as much damage on a successful saving throw).": "炸弹目标点10英尺范围内的每个生物必须在DC 11的灵巧救赎中成功，否则会受到4({@dice 1d8})的火焰伤害（救赎成功时伤害为一半）。",
	"If all else fails, the kobolds scramble up their makeshift ladder and attack with their shortswords.": "如果一切都失败了，哥布林们就爬上他们临时搭建的梯子，用短剑攻击。",
	"{@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}) moved into this simple but comfortable chamber when the camp was abandoned. If no fight has occurred with the guards in area 12 and characters enter this chamber from {@area area 9|0c1|x}, then Mondath is here when they arrive. Guards in area 12 hear whatever happens in this chamber and respond dutifully.": "{@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ}（见{@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}）在营地被遗弃时搬进了这个简单而舒适的房间。如果没有与12区的守卫发生争斗，并且角色从{@area area 9|0c1|x}进入这个房间，那么当他们到达时，蒙达斯就在这里。12区的守卫会听到这个房间里发生的任何事情，并尽职尽责地做出反应。",
	"The chamber contains a writing desk and stool, several tables with books and papers, and a mirror on a floor stand. Light comes from two oil lamps. Thick rugs completely cover the floor, including an open chute that drops down to area 9. A rope ladder is fixed in the chute for climbing up and down, but nothing marks the position of the open, 3-foot-wide hole when it is covered by rugs. The slight depression it causes in the rug can be noticed with a successful DC 10 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. If someone steps on the chute without knowing it's there, the character must make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. Success means the character hops off the rug before it collapses through the hole, or grabs the top of ladder as he or she falls; failure means the character plunges 30 feet down the chute into area 9, taking {@dice 3d6} bludgeoning damage from the fall.": "房间里有一张写字台和凳子，几张摆放着书籍和文件的桌子，以及一面摆在地板上的镜子。光线来自于两盏油灯。厚厚的地毯完全覆盖了地板，包括一条通向第9区的开放式滑道。一个绳梯被固定在滑道上，用于爬上爬下，但当它被地毯覆盖时，没有任何东西标志着这个开放的、3英尺宽的洞的位置。只要成功地进行DC10智慧（（%0%））检查，就可以注意到它在地毯上造成的轻微凹陷。如果有人在不知道滑道存在的情况下踩到了它，这个角色必须做一个DC 10的灵巧救赎动作。成功意味着角色在地毯从洞口坍塌之前跳下，或者在坠落时抓住梯子的顶端；失败意味着角色从滑道上坠落30英尺到9号区域，在坠落时受到{@dice 3d6}重击伤害。",
	"Spread open on one of the tables is a simple map of the Greenfields area showing the villages the cult attacked and looted. An arrow is sketched in from the Greenfields toward the west and the town of Beregost on the Trade Way, where the arrow turns north. A separate sheet of paper that is covered with numerals in columns contains the note, \"Everything must be freighted north to Naerytar. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} allowed us to keep some pearls, a ring, and a handful of small stones.\" Other papers are of less interest; most of them have bad poetry about dragons.": "在其中一张桌子上摊开的是一张简单的绿野地区地图，显示了邪教所攻击和掠夺的村庄。一个箭头从绿原区向西勾勒，贸易路上的贝雷戈斯特镇，箭头在那里转向北方。一张单独的纸上用数字列着，上面写着：\"所有东西都必须向北运到Naerytar。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}允许我们保留一些珍珠、一枚戒指和一小撮小石头\"。其他的文件就不太感兴趣了，它们中的大多数都有关于龙的坏诗。",
	"The smaller chamber off the main one contains a bed, a trunk containing Mondath's clothes, and a second trunk containing Mondath's Cult of the Dragon regalia and a key to the chest in area 9. With this regalia, one person (preferably a human woman, but the clothing can be adjusted to fit a man) can be outfitted as a Wearer of Purple. It's worth noting that each Wearer of Purple's regalia is similar but unique, so high-ranking cult members are likely to recognize this regalia as Mondath's. When they see that the person wearing it is not Mondath, or if they know she is dead, alarm bells are guaranteed to go off.": "主房间外的小房间里有一张床，一个装着蒙达斯衣服的箱子，还有一个装着蒙达斯的龙之崇拜服饰的箱子和一把通往第9区箱子的钥匙。有了这些装备，一个人（最好是人类女性，但衣服可以调整为适合男性）可以被装备成紫色的穿戴者。值得注意的是，每个 \"紫色穿戴者 \"的服饰都是相似但独特的，所以高级邪教成员很可能会认出这套服饰是蒙达斯的。当他们看到穿着它的人不是蒙达斯，或者他们知道她已经死了，警钟一定会响起。",
	"If a fight breaks out in area 12 and four of the guards from that chamber retreat here to defend Mondath, her response is up to you. If the fight in the barracks takes a heavy toll on the characters, she might decide to confront them here. If the attackers plow through her forward guards, Mondath might retreat down the chute to area 9 and join forces with Cyanwrath or even flee from the cave. She has dedicated her life to the Cult of the Dragon, but she isn't eager to die for the cult. Mondath knows that the Cult is amassing treasure in the north and that {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} spoke often of Tiamat, but that is the extent of her knowledge of the larger plan.": "如果第12区发生了战斗，那间屋子里的四个卫兵退到这里来保卫蒙达斯，她的反应就取决于你。如果军营里的战斗对人物造成了很大的伤害，她可能会决定在这里与他们对峙。如果攻击者冲破了她的前卫，蒙达斯可能会顺着滑道撤退到第9区，与赛恩沃斯联手，甚至从洞穴里逃走。她已经把自己的生命献给了神龙教，但她并不急于为神龙教而死。蒙达斯知道邪教正在北方积聚财宝，而且{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}经常谈到提亚马特，但这是她对大计划的了解程度。",
	"The guards who remained behind with Mondath use this chamber as their barracks. They maintain a two-person watch at the entrance (area 1); two dragonclaws are currently on duty in that area, and the others—three {@creature Guard||guards} and eight {@creature Cultist||cultists}—are here, asleep or relaxing. If fighting against the dragonclaws from area 1 pushes near the passage to area 12, roll a {@dice d20}; the guards here investigate the sound on a roll of 12 or higher. Otherwise they stay here, mostly oblivious to what's going on elsewhere.": "和蒙达斯一起留下来的守卫把这个房间作为他们的营房。他们在入口处（1号区域）保持着两人的监视；目前有两只龙爪在那个区域值班，其他的--三只（%0%）和八只（%1%）--在这里睡觉或休息。如果与第1区的龙爪作战时，在通往第12区的通道附近推了一把（%2%）；这里的守卫在掷出12或更高的分数时调查了声音。否则他们就呆在这里，对其他地方发生的事情大多漠不关心。",
	"If characters enter this chamber from area 2, the guards react quickly. Two of the guards and five of the cultists fight the characters here while one guard and three of the cultists retreat to area 11 to protect {@creature Frulam Mondath|HotDQ}.": "如果角色从2区进入这个密室，守卫会迅速做出反应。两名守卫和五名邪教徒在这里与角色战斗，而一名守卫和三名邪教徒则撤退到11区保护（%0%）。",
	"The guards' scabbards are decorated with dragon motifs. They are worth about 5 gp each. They are not part of a Cult of the Dragon \"uniform,\" but wearing one of these scabbards could buy a character credibility when trying to pose as a cultist. For example, you might grant a +1 bonus to Charisma checks made to fool or influence cultists. Aside from their gear, the guards have coins and small gems worth a total of 120 gp.": "守卫的刀鞘上有龙的图案装饰。每个价值约5戈比。它们不属于神龙教的 \"制服\"，但在试图冒充邪教人士时，佩戴这些刀鞘可以为角色赢得信誉。例如，你可以在愚弄或影响邪教人员时，给予魅力检查+1的奖励。除了他们的装备外，卫兵们还有总价值为120金币的硬币和小宝石。",
	"This chamber is now mostly empty, except for a few overturned boxes, broken items, scattered coins, small gems that were dropped during the hasty evacuation, and one {@creature cultist} who is sleeping soundly on the floor after consuming several bottles of wine. He won't wake up from anything less than vigorous shaking, and it will be several hours before he is coherent. All the dropped items left in this room have a total value of only 16 gp.": "这个密室现在大部分是空的，除了一些翻倒的箱子、破碎的物品、散落的硬币、匆忙撤离时掉落的小宝石，还有一个（%0%）在喝了几瓶酒后在地上酣睡。如果不是大力摇晃，他是不会醒来的，要过几个小时才会有精神。留在这个房间里的所有掉落物品的总价值只有16戈比。",
	"Award standard XP for defeated foes. This chapter includes many challenges other than fights, and characters should be rewarded for overcoming them. The awards listed below are just recommendations; adjust them as you see fit. Characters might reach 4th level by the end of this chapter, but it's not essential that they do.": "为被打败的敌人奖励标准XP。本章包括许多战斗以外的挑战，角色克服了这些挑战就应该得到奖励。下面列出的奖励只是建议，你可以根据自己的需要进行调整。角色在本章结束时可能会达到4级，但这并不是必须的。",
	"If you are using the milestone experience rule, the characters reach 4th level.": "如果你使用的是里程碑式的经验规则，人物就达到了4级。",
	"For locating and disarming traps: 100 XP per trap.": "用于定位和解除陷阱。每个陷阱100XP。",
	"For offering the roper meat instead of fighting it to the death: 1,800 XP (the roper's standard XP value).": "因为提供给漫游者肉，而不是和它决一死战。1,800 XP(该牧羊人的标准XP值)。",

	"With the dragon hatchery destroyed and the cultists all gone, characters should head for Elturel and their rendezvous with {@creature Leosin Erlanthar|HotDQ} and {@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}. They might choose to follow the wagon tracks instead. The wagons followed the course roughly laid out on the map in Mondath's chamber: west to Beregost, then north along the Trade Way. They have at least a full day's head start on the characters, and possibly more, depending on how much time characters spent in Greenest before returning to the plateau.": "随着龙的孵化场被摧毁，邪教分子全部消失，角色们应该前往Elturel，与{@creature Leosin Erlanthar|HotDQ}和{@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}会合。他们可能会选择沿着马车的轨迹前进。马车沿着蒙达斯房间里的地图上的路线前进：向西到贝雷戈斯特，然后沿着贸易路向北。他们至少比人物领先了一整天，甚至可能更多，这取决于人物在返回高原之前在Greenest花了多少时间。",
	"The treasure looted from the Greenfields is headed north on the Trade Way, hidden in unmarked freight wagons that are part of the regular merchant traffic of that well-traveled road. The heroes must find out where all that loot is going, which means taking a long, danger-filled trip northward.": "从绿地掠夺来的财宝正沿着贸易之路北上，藏在没有标记的货运车中，这些车是这条康庄大道上正常商人交通的一部分。英雄们必须找出所有这些战利品的去向，这意味着要向北走一段漫长的、充满危险的旅程。",
	"The characters should travel from the abandoned cult camp southeast of Greenest to the city of Elturel on the River Chionthar. Their route takes them back through Greenest, where they can return any stolen goods that they recovered from the cult and recuperate from their wounds. Nighthill greets the characters with delight and respect. He tells them that before {@creature Leosin Erlanthar|HotDQ} left town, he bought horses and riding gear for the characters to speed their journey to Elturel. The horses are being kept at the dealer's stables until the characters are ready to leave for Elturel; all their costs are paid for.": "角色们应该从Greenest东南的废弃邪教营地出发，前往Chionthar河上的Elturel城市。他们的路线要经过格林斯特，在那里他们可以归还从邪教那里搜出的任何赃物，并休养伤势。奈特希尔高兴地迎接了这些人物，并表示尊重。他告诉他们，在{@creature Leosin Erlanthar|HotDQ}离开镇子之前，他为人物买了马和骑具，以加快他们去Elturel的旅程。这些马匹被存放在经销商的马厩里，直到人物准备好前往Elturel；他们的所有费用都已支付。",
	"On horseback, characters can travel the 200 miles from Greenest to Elturel in about six days. They make the journey without incident, unless you throw an encounter or two at them to spice up the trip or to increase their XP totals. Encounters with bandits, humanoid clans, and roving monsters are appropriate in the untamed expanses of the Greenfields.": "在马背上，角色们可以在六天内从格林斯特到艾尔崔尔走完200英里。他们在旅途中不会发生任何意外，除非你给他们带来一两个遭遇，以增加旅途的乐趣或增加他们的XP总量。遇到强盗、人形部族和游荡的怪物，在绿野的未开化地区是合适的。",
	"Elturel, a large, orderly city overlooking the River Chionthar, is filled with merchants, river traders, and farmers' markets. Its most distinguishing feature is a brilliant magical light that hovers above it, illuminating it day and night. This light is painful to undead and is visible from almost every corner of Elturgard (of which Elturel is the capital), appearing from afar as a star or distant sun.": "Elturel是一座俯瞰奇昂塔尔河的大型有序城市，到处都是商人、河贩和农贸市场。它最突出的特点是有一道灿烂的魔法之光，盘旋在它的上方，日夜照耀着它。这种光对亡灵来说是痛苦的，几乎从埃尔图尔加德（埃尔图尔是其首都）的每个角落都能看到，从远处看就像一颗星星或遥远的太阳。",
	"When the characters meet {@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}, they find him to be a good-natured paladin of Torm, the god of heroics and bravery. He is a man of action who loves jokes and pranks, a stiff drink, and a friendly scuffle.": "当人物遇到{@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}时，他们发现他是一个好脾气的托尔姆的圣骑士，托尔姆是英雄和勇敢之神。他是一个喜欢开玩笑和恶作剧的人，喜欢喝烈酒和友好的混战。",
	"If characters ask for {@creature Leosin Erlanthar|HotDQ} when they arrive in Elturel, none of the locals know him. If they ask for {@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}, anyone can direct them to the \"headquarters\" of Frume's faction, the Order of the Gauntlet, at a tavern called A Pair of Black Antlers. If the characters arrive within a tenday of Erlanthar's departure from Greenest, then the monk is still there with his handful of disciples, too.": "如果人物在到达Elturel时询问{@creature Leosin Erlanthar|HotDQ}，当地人都不认识他。如果他们问（%1%），任何人都可以把他们引到弗鲁姆派系的 \"总部\"--高塔骑士团，在一个叫 \"一对黑鹿角 \"的小酒馆。如果人物在埃尔兰萨离开格林斯特后的一个工作日内到达，那么这个僧侣和他的少数弟子也还在那里。",
	"You can spend as much or as little time on interactions in Elturel as you and your players want. Characters are guaranteed to have a good time in Frume's company, provided they consider continual drinking, arm-wrestling, horseback riding contests, sparring, and weapon training to be a good time. If the players don't realize it, Erlanthar finds a quiet moment to be sure the characters understand that impressing Frume with their prowess, their honesty, and their drive is in their long-term interest. The characters can make a positive impression on Frume by winning a few contests (resolved quickly with opposed skill or ability checks) or sparring matches against his troopers or by telling entertaining tales of their exploits during the Greenest raid, in the raiders' camp, and in the dragon caves.": "你可以根据你和你的玩家的需要，在Elturel的互动上花更多或更少的时间。只要角色认为不断地喝酒、掰手腕、骑马比赛、比武和武器训练是一种好时光，就能保证他们在弗鲁姆的公司里过得很开心。如果玩家们没有意识到这一点，Erlanthar会找一个安静的时刻来确保角色们明白，用他们的能力、他们的诚实和他们的动力来打动Frumm是符合他们长期利益的。角色们可以通过赢得一些竞赛（通过相反的技能或能力检查快速解决）或与他的部队进行比武，或者通过讲述他们在Greenest突袭中、在突袭者营地中和在龙洞中的有趣故事来给Frum留下积极印象。",
	"Late in the evening, after a day when Frume has been suitably impressed by the characters, he sends one of his squires to summon them to a private room in the tavern.": "在一天之后的深夜，弗鲁姆对这些人物留下了适当的印象，他派他的一个侍从把他们召集到酒馆的一个私人房间。",
	"Frume's squire shows you to a private space off the tavern's common room and closes the door when he leaves. Waiting for you in the room are the broad-shouldered human paladin, the monk Leosin, and many pitchers of dark red wine. The paladin's face wears a serious expression, unlike its usual open countenance.": "弗鲁姆的侍从带你到酒馆公共房间外的一个私人空间，他离开时关上了门。在房间里等着你的是宽肩的人类圣骑士、修士Leosin和许多投掷的暗红色葡萄酒。圣骑士的脸上带着严肃的表情，与平时开放的面孔不同。",
	"\"My friends, we have important business to discuss. At this point, you know almost as much about it as we do, and thanks to you, we know twice as much today as we did a tenday ago. Something rotten is afoot. We have no formal organization to oppose these rascals—not yet anyway. We're working on that. And we need people like you, who know how and when to fight, and how and when to keep their heads down and observe. We can't promise you anything except long days filled with danger and stress—but what could be better than that, eh?\"": "\"我的朋友们，我们有重要的事情要讨论。在这一点上，你们知道的几乎和我们一样多，而且多亏了你们，我们今天知道的东西是一天前的两倍。腐朽的东西正在酝酿。我们没有正式的组织来反对这些流氓--反正还没有。我们正在努力解决这个问题。我们需要像你这样的人，知道如何和何时战斗，以及如何和何时保持低头观察。除了充满危险和压力的漫长日子，我们不能向你承诺什么--但还有什么比这更好的呢，嗯？",
	"{@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ} and {@creature Leosin Erlanthar|HotDQ}, along with a handful of other concerned leaders and scholars along the Sword Coast, are in the early stages of organizing against the Cult of the Dragon.": "{@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}和{@creature Leosin Erlanthar|HotDQ}，以及剑海岸的其他一些相关领导人和学者，正处于组织起来反对神龙教的早期阶段。",
	"Erlanthar's organization is the Harpers. Characters might have heard of the older Harpers, but they're unlikely to know much about the secretive group beyond what is generally rumored: that the Harpers are dedicated to furthering equality and justice and to keeping power out of the hands of those who don't deserve it. Erlanthar explains that the Harpers are loosely organized; agents are allowed wide freedom of action.": "Erlanthar的组织是Harpers。角色们可能听说过老一辈的哈珀斯，但他们不可能对这个神秘的组织有太多的了解，除了一般的传闻：哈珀斯致力于促进平等和正义，不让权力落入那些不值得的人手中。Erlanthar解释说，哈珀斯组织很松散；代理人被允许有广泛的行动自由。",
	"{@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ} represents the Order of the Gauntlet. His order shares many of the Harpers' principles, but the two organizations are very different. The Order of the Gauntlet emphasizes faith, vigilance, and constant struggle against threats of evil. Many of its members are clerics and paladins, but the order welcomes anyone who shares its ideals. Discipline is key, and the order is distinctly more structured and hierarchical than the Harpers.": "{@creature Ontharr Frume|HotDQ}代表高塔骑士团。他的组织与哈珀斯的许多原则相同，但这两个组织却非常不同。高塔骑士团强调信仰、警惕和与邪恶威胁的不断斗争。它的许多成员是牧师和圣骑士，但该组织欢迎任何与它有共同理想的人。纪律是关键，而且该组织明显比哈珀斯组织更有结构性和等级性。",
	"The top concern of both groups is the Cult of the Dragon. In the past, the cult was more active to the east and it was focused on creating dracoliches. Its shift to the Sword Coast and new emphasis on living dragons and on Tiamat are cause for concern. The cult is on the move and it's up to something big; the Order of the Gauntlet, the Harpers, and a third allied group known as the Emerald Enclave want to thwart the cult's plans.": "这两个团体最关心的问题是龙的崇拜。在过去，该邪教在东部比较活跃，它专注于创造龙族。它向剑海岸的转移以及对活龙和提亚马特的新强调，都令人担忧。该邪教正在行动，并在酝酿一件大事；高塔骑士团、哈珀斯和第三个被称为翡翠飞地的联盟组织想要挫败该邪教的计划。",
	"In this meeting, Frume and Erlanthar are offering the characters the chance to join their factions. At this early stage, there is no pay for members and there are no ranks. What they can offer is help and support from other members and allies, who are spread from Nashkel and Candlekeep in the south to Neverwinter and Mirabar in the north. The horses that Erlanthar arranged for the characters are just one small example of the aid the Harpers and the Order of the Gauntlet can provide.": "在这次会议中，Frumm和Erlanthar为人物提供了加入他们派系的机会。在这个早期阶段，成员没有报酬，也没有等级。他们能提供的是来自其他成员和盟友的帮助和支持，他们分布在南部的纳什克尔和烛台镇到北部的永夜城和米拉巴尔。Erlanthar为人物安排的马匹只是哈珀斯和高塔骑士团可以提供的援助的一个小例子。",
	"Harpers can be recognized by the group's symbol: a silver harp nestled between the horns of a crescent moon. Some people wear the symbol openly, and others keep it concealed. Erlanthar wears his as a medallion around his neck when he is certain that he's not heading into a potential captive situation—sometimes openly and sometimes tucked away. Members of the Order of the Gauntlet wear their holy symbols openly. (Frume's is the right-handed gauntlet of Torm.) The order's universal symbol is a gauntlet grasping a sword by the blade. Frume wears such a symbol on a pendant around his neck, hidden below his flowing beard.": "哈珀人可以通过该团体的标志来识别：一个银色的竖琴依偎在一个新月的犄角之间。有些人公开佩戴这个标志，有些人则将其隐藏起来。埃兰萨在确定自己没有进入潜在的俘虏情况时，就把他的徽章戴在脖子上--有时是公开的，有时是藏起来的。高塔骑士团的成员公开佩戴他们的神圣标志。(Frumume的是Torm的右手铠甲。)该组织的通用标志是一个抓住剑刃的铠甲。弗鲁姆把这样的标志戴在脖子上的吊坠上，藏在他飘逸的胡须下面。",
	"Characters don't need to join either faction, but there are advantages to doing so and no real drawbacks. Even if characters don't agree to join, Frume and Erlanthar try to enlist their aid in tracking the cult's shipments.": "角色不需要加入任何一个派别，但这样做有好处，没有真正的坏处。即使角色不同意加入，弗鲁姆和埃兰萨也会试图让他们协助追踪邪教的货物。",
	"Thanks to the characters, the Harpers now know that the cult is amassing treasure and shipping it north. Where exactly this treasure is going and what the cult plans to do with it are the next two questions that need answering. Frume and Erlanthar would like the characters to join the cult's caravan and accompany it on the journey. They could get themselves hired as guards—if not by the cult's wagon masters, then by other merchants who are traveling in the same direction at the same time. Merchants from different companies commonly join together to form larger trains for protection. Frume has contacts among the many merchants of the region and is certain he can arrange a job.": "多亏了这些人物，哈珀人现在知道邪教正在收集财宝并将其运往北方。接下来需要回答的两个问题是：这些财宝到底要去哪里，以及邪教打算用这些财宝做什么。Frume和Erlanthar希望角色们能加入邪教的商队，并在旅途中陪伴它。他们可以让自己被雇佣为卫兵--如果不是被邪教的马车主人雇佣，那就是被同时朝同一方向旅行的其他商人雇佣。来自不同公司的商人通常会联合起来，组成更大的列车以获得保护。弗鲁姆在这一地区的许多商人中都有联系，他肯定能安排一份工作。",
	"Timing is an issue. The tracks leaving the cultists' camp and the map from Mondath's chamber both indicate that the wagons were heading west to pick up the Coast Way road, where they would turn north to Beregost and Baldur's Gate, a journey of about 550 miles. The wagons would take twenty-five to thirty days for that trip, depending on conditions. The wagons pulled out at least a day ahead of the characters' return to the camp, and the characters probably spent a day exploring the abandoned camp and clearing out the dragon hatchery. Returning to Greenest, resting, and traveling to Elturel account for eight to ten more days. Unless the characters walked to Elturel or lounged for days in Greenest before coming north, they should have at least ten to fifteen days before the cult's wagons reach Baldur's Gate.": "时间是个问题。离开邪教徒营地的足迹和蒙达斯密室的地图都表明，马车正向西驶去，准备走上海岸路，在那里他们将向北转到贝雷戈斯特和博德之门，行程约550英里。根据情况，马车需要二十五到三十天的时间来完成这一行程。马车至少比人物返回营地的时间提前一天停靠，人物可能花了一天时间探索废弃的营地，并清理了龙的孵化场。回到Greenest，休息一下，然后去Elturel，这需要八到十天。除非人物是步行到Elturel，或者在北上之前在Greenest闲逛了好几天，否则在邪教的马车到达Baldur's Gate之前，他们应该至少有10到15天的时间。",
	"The River Chionthar flows directly from Elturel to Baldur's Gate. A sailing vessel can make that trip downstream in about three days if it ties up overnight for safety, or two if it risks pushing on through the night by lamplight. Frume has already arranged for such a boat to leave at dawn the next morning. They are also provided with 50 gp each to cover expenses on the trip.": "奇昂塔尔河从艾尔图勒直接流向博德之门。如果为了安全起见，一艘帆船可以在三天内顺流而下，如果冒险在夜里借着灯火继续前进，则需要两天。弗鲁姆已经安排好了这样一艘船，在第二天早上的黎明离开。还为他们每人提供了50戈比，以支付此行的费用。",
	"If the characters turn down this mission, Frume makes some remarks about how they aren't the people he thought they were, and he leaves the meeting more than a little bit angry. Erlanthar stays and makes one more appeal to their sense of honor and duty. If the characters still turn him down, he reaches into his tunic and pulls out a soft leather pouch, which he hands to one of the characters. Inside is a magnificent ruby worth 1,200 gp. He explains that if they take the mission, this ruby will be waiting for them in the hands of a Harper agent in Waterdeep.": "如果这些人物拒绝了这个任务，弗鲁姆就会说他们不是他认为的那种人，他就会离开会议，而且有点生气。Erlanthar留下来，再次呼吁他们的荣誉感和责任感。如果这些人物仍然拒绝他，他就把手伸进他的外衣，掏出一个软皮袋，递给其中一个人物。里面是一颗华丽的红宝石，价值1,200戈比。他解释说，如果他们接受了这个任务，这颗红宝石就会在沃特迪普的一个哈珀特工手中等待他们。",
	"That night, Frume sees that the characters are all equipped with new clothing and gear, and even new weapons if they want. He suggests that they change their appearance as much as they can in simple ways, to reduce the odds of anyone they might have met at the cult camp recognizing them.": "那天晚上，弗鲁姆看到人物都配备了新的衣服和装备，如果他们愿意，甚至还有新的武器。他建议他们尽可能以简单的方式改变自己的外表，以减少他们在邪教营地可能遇到的人认出他们的几率。",
	"The trip downriver to Baldur's Gate is uneventful, regardless of whether it takes three days or two. The characters can bring their horses along on the boat if they wish. The horses won't like it, but they'll manage.": "顺流而下到Baldur's Gate的旅程并不顺利，不管是花三天还是两天。如果他们愿意，人物可以把他们的马带上船。马匹不会喜欢这样，但它们可以应付。",
	"Baldur's Gate is a bustling center of trade, with goods coming from north and south by wagon along the Trade Way and by ship on the Sea of Swords, and from the east along the River Chionthar and from Cormyr and Sembia. Baldur's Gate is situated on a prominent bluff next to the river, overlooking an excellent natural harbor. It is divided into three distinct segments: the Upper City where the richest and most influential citizens live and where the city's marketplace (the Wide) is located; the Lower City, which surrounds the harbor and where most of the city's merchants live and conduct their business; and the Outer City, which lies outside the walls and where most of the city's laborers reside in conditions that vary from crowded but clean to squalid.": "博德之门是一个繁华的贸易中心，货物从北方和南方沿贸易之路、从剑海乘船而来，从东方沿奇安塔尔河、从科米尔和森比亚而来。博德之门位于河边一个突出的悬崖上，俯瞰着一个绝佳的天然港口。它被分为三个不同的部分：上城，最富有和最有影响力的公民居住在这里，城市的市场（Wide）也在这里；下城，围绕着港口，城市的大多数商人居住在这里并开展业务；外城，位于城墙外，城市的大多数劳动者居住在这里，条件从拥挤但干净到肮脏不等。",
	"Depending on timing, characters might have just a few days to wait in Baldur's Gate, or up to a tenday. Most of that time should be spent contacting a merchant recommended by Frume and arranging affairs so they can spot the cult wagons when they arrive.": "根据时间安排，人物可能只有几天的时间在Baldur's Gate等待，或者长达一个工作日。其中大部分时间应该用来联系Frumm推荐的商人，并安排好事务，以便他们在邪教马车到达时能够发现。",
	"Frume's contact is a human trader named Ackyn Selebon. He operates an equipage business in the Outer City north of the city wall, in a district called Blackgate. There he sells all the material needed for long-distance freight hauling: wagons, rope, netting, grease, chains, wheels, and so on. His shop also repairs wagons. He is not directly involved in the hiring of guards for caravans, but he knows people who are. With him to vouch for the characters, they should have no trouble getting hired on as guards for a northbound caravan, but he can't give them work with a specific merchant.": "弗鲁姆的联系人是一个名叫Ackyn Selebon的人类商人。他在城墙以北的外城经营装备生意，在一个叫黑门的地区。他在那里出售长途货运所需的所有材料：马车、绳子、网子、油脂、链条、车轮等等。他的商店还修理马车。他不直接参与雇佣商队的守卫，但他认识一些人。有了他的担保，他们被雇用为北行商队的守卫应该没有问题，但他不能给他们提供特定商人的工作。",
	"Baldur's Gate doesn't allow wagons, pack animals, horses, or even dogs into the city. The streets are so narrow, steep, and slick from frequent rain that heavy wagons would be a menace. This is actually one of the reasons why Baldur's Gate is such a bustling commercial hub: for goods to pass through the city from south to north, for example, they must be unloaded in the Outer City east of the wall, carried through the city by porters on foot, and reloaded onto different wagons north of the city for the rest of their journey. No road conveniently bypasses the city—a situation that the gate's profiteering intermediaries work hard to maintain. Most merchants find it easier to sell their loads to those intermediaries and consignment dealers when they reach Baldur's Gate, buy a new load of exotic goods from somewhere far away, and turn around and head back home, where they can again sell the new goods at a profit.": "博德之门不允许马车、驮兽、马，甚至狗进入城市。街道非常狭窄、陡峭，而且经常下雨导致路面湿滑，沉重的马车会成为一种威胁。这实际上也是博德之门成为如此繁华的商业中心的原因之一：例如，货物要从南到北通过城市，必须在城墙以东的外城卸货，由搬运工人步行穿过城市，然后重新装到城北的不同马车上，继续他们的旅程。没有任何道路可以方便地绕过城市--这是城门的暴利中间商努力维持的局面。大多数商人发现，当他们到达博德门时，更容易将他们的货物卖给那些中间商和寄售商，从很远的地方买一车新的异国货物，然后转身回家，在那里他们可以再次出售新的货物以获得利润。",
	"Along with wagons, guards seldom make a continuous journey through Baldur's Gate. Guards for northbound caravans are typically hired in Blackgate where northbound wagons begin their journey. Selebon tells the characters that if they hang around any of the taverns or tent saloons near his shop, they are sure to see all the northbound traffic. They shouldn't hesitate to use him as a reference if a potential employer asks for one.": "伴随着马车，守卫很少会在博德之门中进行连续的旅行。北行商队的守卫通常是在黑门雇佣的，北行的马车在那里开始他们的旅程。塞勒本告诉人物，如果他们在他的商店附近的任何一家酒馆或帐篷沙龙里闲逛，他们肯定会看到所有北行的交通。如果有潜在的雇主问起，他们应该毫不犹豫地把他作为一个参考。",
	"The northbound journey from Baldur's Gate is arduous, so merchants travel together for safety. Each merchant hires guards independently, but the common belief is that if everyone hires two or three and enough wagons travel together, the caravan is well protected.": "从博德之门向北的旅程很艰辛，所以商人们为了安全而结伴而行。每个商人都独立地雇佣卫兵，但人们普遍认为，如果每个人都雇佣两到三个卫兵，并且有足够多的马车一起旅行，商队就会得到很好的保护。",
	"Within a few days (the wait is up to you and the timing you've worked out for the cargo's arrival from the camp), characters spot people they recognize from the cult's camp on the plateau. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}, being a half-dragon, can't travel openly in Baldur's Gate; she'd be attacked by a mob. The city's wealthy elite, however, often travel the streets in screened or curtained palanquins for both comfort and privacy. {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} does the same. When characters spot familiar faces from the cult camp, the cultists are carrying or accompanying a palanquin where {@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} rides. They might catch a glimpse of her through a briefly parted curtain if they're observant.": "在几天内（等待的时间取决于你和你为货物从营地到达的时间），角色们发现了他们在高原上的邪教营地里认识的人。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}，作为一个半龙人，不能在博德之门公开旅行；她会被暴徒袭击的。然而，这个城市的富有的精英们，为了舒适和隐私，经常乘坐有屏风或窗帘的轿子在街上行走。{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}也是如此。当人物发现邪教阵营中熟悉的面孔时，这些邪教人员正带着或伴随着{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}乘坐的轿子。如果他们善于观察，可能会透过短暂分开的帘子瞥见她。",
	"{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ} and her bodyguards come to Selebon's yard to purchase five wagons and supplies (having sold the other wagons south of the city). Once they are equipped, local porters pack merchandise and supplies onto the wagons, cover them in canvas, and lash them down.": "{@creature Rezmir|HotDQ}和她的保镖来到塞勒邦的院子里，购买五辆马车和物资（已将其他马车卖到城南）。装备好后，当地的搬运工将商品和物资装上马车，用帆布盖住，然后用绳子绑住。",
	"After the characters have identified the cultists' wagons and seen their arrangements, they should have an easy time getting hired as guards. They can apply to the cultists if they feel like being reckless, but other merchants are making the same preparations to leave on the morrow. Select anyone from the list of merchants and travelers to be a potential employer. Each character makes a Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) or Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check, whichever they prefer. Check the results below.": "在人物确定了邪教分子的马车并看到他们的安排后，他们应该很容易被雇用为卫兵。如果他们觉得自己很鲁莽，可以向邪教分子申请，但其他商人也在做同样的准备，准备在明天离开。从商人和旅行者的名单中选择任何人作为潜在雇主。每个角色进行魅力（（%0%））或力量（（%1%））检查，以他们喜欢的为准。检查结果如下。",
	"No one is interested in hiring the character, but he or she can tag along as a traveler. Guards sometimes quit or die on the road, and a replacement has a chance to find employment.": "没有人有兴趣雇用这个角色，但他或她可以作为一个旅行者跟在后面。警卫有时会辞职或死在路上，而替代者有机会找到工作。",
	"Hired as a basic guard for 5 gp per tenday, plus food and living expenses on the road.": "被雇为基本的警卫，每个工作日5个金币，外加路上的食物和生活费用。",
	"Hired as a sergeant for 8 gp per tenday, plus food and living expenses on the road.": "被聘为中士，每班8戈比，外加路上的食物和生活费。",
	"Hired as a bodyguard for the merchant at 10 gp per tenday, plus food and living expenses on the road.": "受雇为商人的保镖，每个工作日10金币，外加路上的食物和生活费。",
	"All hires are for the journey to Waterdeep. Sergeants are expected to manage two to five other guards. Bodyguards are expected to stick close to their employer and protect him or her against harm.": "所有雇佣的人都是为了前往沃特德普的旅程。中士要管理两到五个其他的卫兵。保镖们要紧跟他们的雇主，保护他或她免受伤害。",
	"During the course of this journey, the characters have opportunities to meet a range of people from across Faerûn. Merchants, mercenaries, pilgrims, scholars, thieves, and explorers all mingle on the great Trade Way.": "在这个旅程中，人物有机会遇到来自整个法鲁恩的各种人。商人、佣兵、朝圣者、学者、盗贼和探险家都在这条伟大的贸易之路上打交道。",
	"Two NPCs who join the caravan partway through the trip are especially important: {@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ} and {@creature Jamna Gleamsilver|HotDQ}. Both join the caravan at Daggerford, about 120 miles south of Waterdeep and the last place where the caravan takes a day-long rest. They are not traveling together; being in Daggerford at the same time is coincidental.": "有两个在旅途中加入商队的NPC特别重要：（%0%）和（%1%）。他们都是在达格福加入商队的，达格福在沃特迪普以南约120英里处，是商队最后休息一天的地方。他们不是一起旅行的，在同一时间出现在达格福德是偶然的。",
	"{@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12} for statistics) is a male human and a Red Wizard of Thay. Red Wizards are widely disliked and mistrusted, so he takes some pains to disguise his membership in that group by always wearing a wool cap with ear and neck flaps to cover his shaved, tattooed head. It's not an especially effective disguise; characters who make a successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check notice the edges of the tattoos peeking out from under the cap. Many Thayans have shaved, tattooed heads, however, but only a few are Red Wizards. Countless Thayans fled their country when the lich Szass Tam seized control, so they are not entirely strange on the Sword Coast. If questioned, Jos claims to be just another Thayan expatriot trying to find refuge while his country is controlled by undead monsters. In fact, other than the denial that he's a Red Wizard, this is all true.": "{@creature Azbara Jos|HotDQ}（统计数字见{@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12}）是一名男性人类，是泰伊的红袍巫师。红袍巫师被广泛厌恶和不信任，所以他花了一些心思来掩饰他的成员身份，他总是戴着一顶有耳翼和颈翼的羊毛帽来遮住他剃光的、有纹身的头。这并不是一种特别有效的伪装；通过DC15智慧({@skill Perception})检查的人物会注意到纹身的边缘从帽子下探出。然而，许多泰雅人都剃了头，纹了身，但只有少数人是红袍巫师。当巫师萨斯-塔姆夺取控制权时，无数的泰雅人逃离了他们的国家，所以他们在剑海岸并不完全陌生。如果被询问，乔斯声称自己只是另一个试图在他的国家被不死怪物控制时找到避难所的泰雅族侨民。事实上，除了否认他是红袍巫师之外，这些都是事实。",
	"Jos buys space aboard one of the cult wagons, although they turned away everyone else who sought passage earlier in the journey. He does not mingle with the other travelers and seldom speaks to anyone except the man who seems to be the leader of the cultists.": "乔斯买了一辆邪教马车的空间，尽管他们拒绝了早些时候寻求通过的所有人。他不与其他旅行者打成一片，除了那个似乎是邪教领袖的人之外，他很少与其他人说话。",
	"{@creature Jamna Gleamsilver|HotDQ} (see {@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12} for statistics) is a female gnome and a member of a secretive organization called the Black Network, also known as the Zhentarim. Outwardly, the Black Network provides mercenaries and other forms of muscle for hire. Informally, it is known as a criminal society akin to a widespread thieves guild. Secretly, its leaders seek to extend their shadowy fingers into every throne room and ruling council chamber in Faerûn. Like the Harpers, the Zhentarim too are aware that the Cult of the Dragon is on the move, and they need to know the cult's plans so they can prevent them from interfering with the Zhentarim's own plans, plus perhaps take advantage of the plunder possibilities.": "{@creature Jamna Gleamsilver|HotDQ}(统计数字见{@adventure appendix D|HotDQ|12})是一个女地精，是一个叫黑网的秘密组织的成员，也被称为Zhentarim。外表上，黑网提供雇佣兵和其他形式的雇佣兵。非正式地，它被称为是一个类似于广泛的盗贼公会的犯罪团体。暗地里，它的领导人试图将他们阴暗的手指伸向法鲁恩的每一个王室和统治者的议事厅。和哈珀人一样，真塔林也知道神龙教在行动，他们需要知道神龙教的计划，以便防止他们干扰真塔林自己的计划，也许还能利用掠夺的可能性。",
	"That's why Gleamsilver joins the caravan. The Black Network's spies learned that the cult is moving freight northward, and, like the characters, she was tasked with finding out what they're hauling and where it's headed. Those above her seriously considered wiping out the caravan with mercenaries disguised as bandits, ransacking the wagons, and torturing cult members for the desired information. Fortunately for the characters, Gleamsilver persuaded her superiors to give her a shot at uncovering the truth in a less bloody fashion. If she hasn't come up with something useful by the time the caravan reaches Waterdeep, she will put plan B—the one involving mass murder—into action.": "这就是格莱姆希尔弗加入商队的原因。黑网的间谍了解到邪教正在向北运输货物，和这些人物一样，她的任务是找出他们所运的货物以及货物的目的地。她上面的人认真考虑用伪装成强盗的雇佣兵消灭商队，洗劫马车，并折磨邪教成员以获得所需的信息。幸运的是，Gleamsilver说服了她的上级，让她以一种不那么血腥的方式来揭开真相。如果在商队到达沃特迪普时，她还没有想出有用的办法，她就会把B计划--涉及大规模谋杀的计划--付诸行动。",
	"Despite the vast gulf between their outlooks, the Black Network and the Harpers have a common enemy, and that is pushing them into an unlikely alliance. Gleamsilver is the antithesis of a hero—she is self-serving, a skilled thief and liar, and willing to murder anyone who stands between her and her goal.": "尽管他们的观点之间存在着巨大的差距，但黑网和哈珀斯有一个共同的敌人，这正促使他们结成一个不太可能的联盟。Gleamsilver是英雄的对立面--她自私自利，是一个熟练的小偷和骗子，并愿意谋杀任何阻挡她和她的目标的人。",
	"This list of twenty NPCs is provided for when you need one quickly. You can, of course, change any details about them that you wish. Use them to flesh out the caravan, to spice up the journey, to help bring the trip to life, and to give characters people to like and protect, or dislike and quarrel with, along the way.": "这二十个NPC的名单是为你快速需要时提供的。当然，你可以根据自己的意愿改变他们的任何细节。用他们来充实大篷车的内容，为旅程增添色彩，使旅程充满生机，并为角色提供喜欢和保护的人，或不喜欢和争吵的人，在一路上。",
	"Ulyeltin is an independent wagon master with two wagons in this caravan. Both are hauling cured furs and uncured hides. He is a boorish man without a trace of civilization about him. He's not unfriendly—just smelly, vulgar, and utterly without manners. His second wagon driver and two laborers, on the other hand, are perfectly pleasant.": "Ulyeltin是一个独立的马车主人，在这个商队中有两辆马车。两辆马车都在拉运腌制的毛皮和未腌制的兽皮。他是一个粗野的人，身上没有一丝文明气息。他不是不友好，只是臭气熏天，粗俗不堪，而且完全没有礼貌。另一方面，他的第二个马车夫和两个工人则非常讨人喜欢。",
	"A lawyer by training but a skunk by inclination, Urnpoleshurst is relocating from Baldur's Gate to anywhere that isn't Baldur's Gate. Gossip around the caravan is that he was driven out by a scandal, and that's hard not to believe. He is suspicious of everyone and makes outrageous accusations at the drop of a hat.": "厄恩波利斯特受训为律师，但倾向于臭鼬，他正从博德之门搬迁到任何不是博德之门的地方。商队周围的流言蜚语说他是被丑闻赶出来的，这很难不让人相信。他对每个人都心存疑虑，一言不合就提出离谱的指控。",
	"Ale and beer are so common that not much money can be made hauling them long distances. But that's what fills Sechepol's wagon. He will make his money on the road, selling his stock to his fellow travelers in the caravan. He is diplomatic and has a gift for defusing arguments to everyone's satisfaction before they escalate to violence, but he is careless about gear and horses—a fault that can cause friction with those who hate to see a horse mistreated through thoughtlessness.": "麦芽酒和啤酒是如此的普通，以至于远距离运输它们并不能赚到多少钱。但这就是塞克波尔的马车所装的东西。他要在路上赚钱，把他的存货卖给商队里的同伴。他是个外交家，有在争论升级为暴力之前化解争论的天赋，让每个人都满意，但他对装备和马匹很粗心--这个缺点会引起与那些讨厌看到马匹因不经意而被虐待的人的摩擦。",
	"Lewel's wagon is loaded with exotic wood from the Jungle of Chult for the master carpenters and cabinetmakers of Waterdeep to turn into exquisite furniture. She is the exact opposite of Beyd Sechepol in temperament: impatient with people but exacting about her wagon and doting on her animals.": "Lewel的马车装满了来自Chult丛林的奇异木材，供Waterdeep的木匠大师和橱柜制造商将其变成精美的家具。她的性情与贝德-塞克波完全相反：对人不耐烦，但对她的马车要求严格，对她的动物也很宠爱。",
	"Agetul has made this trip several times before and never hesitates to wave that experience in others' faces. She is a perfectionist, and she wants others to know it.": "阿吉图以前已经做过几次这样的旅行，并且从不犹豫地在别人面前挥舞这种经验。她是一个完美主义者，她想让别人知道这一点。",
	"Tobun has driven freight wagons across Faerûn for the past forty years, from Waterdeep to Calimport and from Baldur's Gate to Hillsfar. He is a font of stories and legends, but it's impossible to tell the truth from fiction in his tales. If anyone challenges him on the truth of a story, he grows argumentative, then sullen and vengeful. As long as a traveler stays on his good side, Tobun is a wonderful traveling companion.": "过去四十年来，托本驾驶货运马车穿越法鲁恩，从沃特迪普到卡林波特，从博德之门到希尔斯法尔。他是故事和传说的源泉，但在他的故事中不可能分辨出真相与虚构。如果有人对他的故事的真实性提出质疑，他就会变得争论不休，然后闷闷不乐，充满报复性。只要旅行者站在他的立场上，托本就是一个很好的旅行伙伴。",
	"The reason behind Imsa's name is obvious: she is green from head to foot. Her skin, hair, eyes, nails, teeth—everything about her is green. She readily admits that she is traveling to Waterdeep in search of a remedy for her condition. The coloration doesn't seem to bother her, but she becomes flustered if anyone asks how she came to be this way. She is friendly, if somewhat quiet, as long as the conversation stays away from her past.": "伊姆萨的名字背后的原因很明显：她从头到脚都是绿色的。她的皮肤、头发、眼睛、指甲、牙齿--她的所有东西都是绿色的。她欣然承认，她到沃特德普是为了寻找治疗她病情的方法。这种颜色似乎并不妨碍她，但如果有人问她是如何变成这样的，她就会变得很慌张。她很友好，虽然有些沉默，但只要谈话不涉及她的过去。",
	"This ambitious merchant is hauling scented cooking oil and perfumes from Amn, hoping to make a huge profit from the aristocrats and dandies of Waterdeep. He talks about money constantly: how much he intends to make, how he will spend it, and how others will envy him for it. He will not spend a single copper buying anyone else a drink or a roasted turnip during the entire trip.": "这个雄心勃勃的商人正在从阿姆拉运芳香的食用油和香水，希望从水底世界的贵族和花花公子那里赚取巨额利润。他不停地谈论钱：他打算赚多少钱，他将如何花钱，以及其他人将如何羡慕他的钱。在整个行程中，他不会花一个铜板请别人喝酒或吃烤萝卜。",
	"From time to time, Lasfelro inexplicably breaks into merry songs and short stretches of joke-telling. His voice is a fine tenor and his jokes are hilarious. But these gregarious moods are always short. The rest of the time, he is silent as the grave, staring sullenly at the road ahead, barely moving on the seat of his wagon, seeming hardly to breathe. No one knows what he transports in his wagon, but it is guarded by a brooding gargoyle that is tethered to the wagon by a slim, silver chain.": "拉斯费罗不时莫名其妙地闯入欢乐的歌曲和短促的笑话。他的声音是一个很好的男高音，他的笑话也很搞笑。但这些欢快的情绪总是很短暂。其余的时间，他像坟墓一样沉默不语，闷闷不乐地盯着前面的路，在马车的座位上几乎不动，似乎几乎不呼吸。没有人知道他的马车里装的是什么，但它被一只忧郁的妖怪看守着，这只妖怪被一条细长的银链拴在马车上。",
	"Widris is as honest and courageous as mercenaries come. She has spent many years in the south and now wants to see the snows and frozen seas of the far north and experience what a truly cold wind feels like.": "维德里斯和雇佣兵一样诚实和勇敢。她在南方呆了很多年，现在想去看看遥远的北方的雪和冰冻的海洋，体验一下真正的寒风是什么感觉。",
	"Although Losvius's nose is respectably large, even for a halfling, the appellation Longnose was hung on him for a different reason: he is curious about everything, including other people's business, and especially other people's embarrassing secrets. Losvius doesn't poke his nose where it's not wanted in a search for blackmail material. He is just overpoweringly curious about what other people don't talk about. If he is along, there's a good chance one or more of the characters will find him nosing through their belongings when he thought their backs were turned.": "虽然洛斯维乌斯的鼻子相当大，即使对一个半身人来说也是如此，但长鼻子这个称谓被挂在他身上是出于另一个原因：他对一切都很好奇，包括别人的事情，尤其是别人的尴尬秘密。洛斯维尤斯并不是为了寻找敲诈的材料而把鼻子探到不需要的地方。他只是对别人不说的事有强烈的好奇心。如果他在一起，很有可能一个或更多的人物会发现他在他们认为他们背对着他们的时候偷看他们的物品。",
	"Noohar and his mute brother, Selvek, are hauling exquisite wooden carvings made by the elves of Cormyr. Where his brother communicates only through sign language, Noohar may be the most articulate person the characters have ever met. Speech springs from him like music from the harp of Milil. The fact that he seldom has anything to say never seems to stop him from talking or others from listening.": "努哈尔和他的哑巴哥哥塞尔维克正在拖运科米尔精灵制作的精美木雕作品。他的哥哥只能通过手语进行交流，而努哈尔可能是这些人物所见过的最能说会道的人。言语从他口中涌出，就像米利尔的竖琴发出的音乐。他很少有话可说，但这似乎并不妨碍他说话，也不妨碍别人倾听。",
	"A load of Calishite silk will make Nyerhite Verther a rich man in Waterdeep, or so he believes. Sadly, he did not inspect his silk carefully when he bought it, and it's infested with worms. If anyone spots them and points them out to Verther during the trip, he becomes unhinged in his anger and grief.": "一批卡利希特的丝绸将使尼尔赫特-维瑟成为水底世界的富人，他是这么认为的。可悲的是，他在买丝的时候没有仔细检查，丝上有虫子出没。如果在旅途中有人发现它们并向维瑟指出它们，他就会在愤怒和悲伤中变得不正常。",
	"Esseren grew up in the farmland outside Baldur's Gate, and this is her first trip more than two miles away from home. She is smart, tough, and talented with both spear and bow, but she knows nothing of the world beyond her aunt's farm or of people who deal dishonestly. Her aunt, a wise woman, believes this trip will be good for her.": "艾瑟伦在博德之门外的农田里长大，这是她第一次离家超过两英里的旅行。她很聪明，很坚强，对长矛和弓箭都很有天赋，但她对她姨妈的农场以外的世界和不诚实交易的人一无所知。她的姨妈是个聪明的女人，相信这次旅行对她有好处。",
	"Evenmor is an independent wagon master hauling exotic birds to the lucrative markets in Waterdeep. He is a stubborn, argumentative man with strong opinions about almost everything, but he is generous when it comes to pouring drinks for those who will sit and argue with him endlessly.": "埃文摩尔是一个独立的马车主人，将异国的鸟类拉到沃特德普有利可图的市场。他是一个顽固的、爱争论的人，对几乎所有的事情都有强烈的意见，但当他为那些愿意坐下来和他争论不休的人倒酒时，他很慷慨。",
	"No one knows where Perethun is ultimately headed or why. He eats alone, seldom speaks, and always rides in the back of the wagon, staring wistfully at the road gone by. The only thing that brings him out of this shell is a game of chance. He gambles boisterously and well.": "没有人知道Perethun最终会去哪里，也没有人知道为什么。他独自吃饭，很少说话，总是坐在马车的后面，怀念地凝视着过去的道路。唯一能让他走出这层壳的是一场机会游戏。他赌得很欢，赌得很好。",
	"Perhaps someone who hauls crates of expensive, fragile porcelain in a bouncing, jarring wagon along the Trade Way must be a born optimist. In Samardag's world, the sky is always blue, the weather is always fine, and the outlook for tomorrow is always bright. Odds are he would be a wealthy man if he hung onto his money, but he is a soft touch for every urchin and hard-luck story that crosses his path.": "也许一个在贸易路上用颠簸的马车拖着一箱箱昂贵而脆弱的瓷器的人，一定是个天生的乐观主义者。在萨马尔达格的世界里，天空总是很蓝，天气总是很好，明天的前景总是很光明。如果他抓住他的钱，他可能会成为一个富有的人，但他对每一个与他擦肩而过的顽童和不幸的故事都很宽容。",
	"Among his tribe in his homeland of the Shaar, Sulesdeg's name means \"tall as a lodge pole.\" On the Sword Coast, he is just known as \"the Pole.\" At 7 feet 5 inches in height, he probably is the tallest human the characters or anyone else in the caravan has ever seen. He doesn't talk much, but when he does, people generally listen.": "在他的故乡沙尔的部落中，苏勒德格的名字的意思是 \"像小屋的柱子一样高\"。在剑海岸，他只是被称为 \"柱子\"。他身高7英尺5英寸，可能是大篷车上的人物或其他任何人见过的最高的人类。他不怎么说话，但当他说话时，人们一般都会听。",
	"It won't take long before everyone in the caravan knows to steer clear of Tyjit Skesh. She is quick to anger and quicker to resort to her blades when something sets her off. She is honest to a fault and never fails to let people know why she was angry, so they can correct their behavior in the future. She will not tolerate bullying.": "用不了多久，商队里的每个人都知道要避开泰吉特-斯凯什。她很快就会发怒，当有事情让她发怒时，她会更快地诉诸于她的刀片。她诚实到了极点，从不吝啬让人知道她为什么生气，这样他们就能在将来纠正自己的行为。她不会容忍欺凌行为。",
	"Quiet, unassuming Werond Torohar can handle a team of horses or mules better than anyone on the Trade Way. She has an uncanny knack for making animals understand what she wants from them with only a twitch on the reins, a whistle, and a snap of her whip. Mud, stones, and ice seem to not be obstacles at all when Torohar is handling the team. She is a starry-eyed romantic at heart, and she can bring strong men to tears with her tales of long-ago lost loves and thwarted passion.": "安静、不张扬的威龙-托罗哈比贸易之路上的任何人都能更好地驾驭一队马或骡子。她有一种不可思议的诀窍，只需抽动一下缰绳，吹一声口哨，抽一下鞭子，就能让动物明白她想要什么。在托罗哈带队时，泥土、石头和冰块似乎根本不是障碍。她是一个内心充满星光的浪漫主义者，她可以用她的故事让强壮的男人流泪，讲述久违的爱情和受挫的激情。",
	"The stretch of road from Baldur's Gate to Waterdeep is a journey of 750 miles. Horse-drawn or mule-drawn freight wagons cover 15 miles per day, depending on conditions. The animals need one day off after every six days of hauling to recover from their work. All things considered, the trip is expected to take two months.": "从博德之门（Baldur's Gate）到沃特德普（Waterdeep）这段路有750英里的路程。马拉或骡拉的货运马车每天行驶15英里，这取决于条件。牲畜在每六天的运输之后需要休息一天，以恢复它们的工作。综合考虑，这次旅行预计需要两个月时间。",
	"The caravan leaving Baldur's Gate contains the three wagons of the Cult of the Dragon plus {@dice 2d4} more. Not all travelers are merchants. A wagon might carry a family relocating to the north or a diplomat on a mission to Waterdeep. People and wagons join the caravan along the way, and others leave according to the dictates of business and fortune. Some travelers ride horses, some walk beside the wagons, and some pay the merchants to ride aboard their wagons. On several occasions, characters notice the cult teamsters turning away passengers even though they have spare room on their wagons.": "离开博德之门的商队包含了神龙教的三辆马车以及{@dice 2d4}更多。并非所有的旅行者都是商人。一辆马车可能载着一个迁往北方的家庭，或者一个去水底世界执行任务的外交官。人们和马车沿途加入商队，而其他人则根据商业和财富的要求离开。有些旅行者骑着马，有些走在马车旁边，有些则付钱给商人，让他们骑上马车。有几次，人物注意到邪教团队成员拒绝乘客，尽管他们的马车上还有空位。",
	"Nothing identifies the cult's wagons as anything but typical merchants hauling northbound freight. They don't bunch up during the day or camp together at night. As far as anyone else knows, their only connection is that they're part of this caravan.": "没有任何东西可以证明邪教的马车是典型的商人，是在拖动北行的货物。他们白天不聚在一起，晚上也不在一起扎营。就其他人所知，他们唯一的联系是他们是这个商队的一部分。",
