	"A terrible threat gathers in the North. Throughout this region of the Forgotten Realms, savage marauders bring destruction. Monsters are on the prowl, preying on flocks, rampaging through croplands, and attacking homesteads and travelers. In settlements, discord and suspicion grow. Sinister strangers lurk in the shadows, whispering about how everything is soon to change. This year brought an unseasonably warm and stormy spring. Tales spread of flooding, windstorms, wildfires, and tremors.": "一个可怕的威胁在北方集结。在被遗忘的王国的整个地区，野蛮的掠夺者带来了破坏。怪物们在徘徊，捕食羊群，在农田里横冲直撞，袭击家园和旅行者。在定居点，不和谐和猜疑在增长。阴险的陌生人潜伏在阴影中，低声说着一切很快就会改变。今年带来了一个反常的温暖和风暴的春天。洪水、暴风、野火和地震的传说不断传播。",
	"These troubles have a source known to few in the North: Elemental Evil. Servants of this malevolence gather in the Sumber Hills and spy on the Dessarin Valley, drawn by a force they can't explain. Dabbling in dangerous lore, these fanatics seek to master elemental magic and unleash its destructive power everywhere. And they are further along in their plans than most people in the North realize.": "这些麻烦有一个在北方很少有人知道的来源。元素的邪恶。这种邪恶的仆人们聚集在桑伯山，监视着德萨林谷，被一种他们无法解释的力量所吸引。这些狂热者沉迷于危险的传说，试图掌握元素魔法，并在各地释放其破坏性力量。而且他们的计划比北方大多数人意识到的要更进一步。",
	"Four elemental cults grow in power in the Sumber Hills, claiming abandoned keeps that connect to an underground fortress once part of an ancient dwarven kingdom. Within those chambers are the remnants of a temple built by drow worshipers of Elemental Evil. Each of the four cults venerates a powerful entity of air, earth, fire, or water: a Prince of Elemental Evil. Like their princes, the four cults are rivals, yet they all serve a mysterious force they call the Elder Elemental Eye.": "四个元素教派在桑伯山的势力越来越大，他们声称有废弃的堡垒与地下要塞相连，而地下要塞曾是古代矮人王国的一部分。在这些房间里，有一座由崇拜元素邪恶的鸦人建造的神庙的遗迹。四个邪教中的每一个都敬仰一个强大的空气、土、火或水的实体：一个元素邪恶的王子。就像他们的王子一样，这四个教派是竞争对手，但他们都服务于一个神秘的力量，他们称之为 \"长老元素之眼\"。",
	"A prophet gifted with a powerful elemental weapon leads each cult. Those weapons—{@item Windvane|PotA}, {@item Ironfang|PotA}, {@item Tinderstrike|PotA}, and {@item Drown|PotA}—were the catalysts for the creation of four elemental nodes, places where the Elemental Planes connect to the Material Plane. The cults draw elemental creatures through the nodes, and they use elemental magic to create {@item devastation orb|PotA}s capable of ravaging the countryside. They've been testing these magic weapons, bolstering the cults' ranks, and infiltrating various communities, all directed by visions the prophets receive from the Elder Elemental Eye.

	"The presence of Elemental Evil in the Sumber Hills goes back thousands of years, when a sect of renegade drow discovered the extensive caverns beneath the Sumber Hills and claimed it as their territory. These dark elves venerated a terrible god of primordial evil, and they built a shrine to this nameless power. In time, the ancient drow cult faded away (or was wiped out), and the place known as the Temple of the Elder Elemental Eye was forgotten for centuries.": "邪恶元素在桑伯山的存在可以追溯到几千年前，当时一个叛逆的乌鸦教派发现了桑伯山下的大量洞穴，并声称这是他们的领土。这些黑暗精灵崇尚一种可怕的原始邪恶之神，他们为这种无名的力量建造了一座神殿。随着时间的推移，古老的乌鸦崇拜逐渐消失（或被消灭），这个被称为长老元素之眼神庙的地方被遗忘了几个世纪。",
	"The dwarves of Besilmer were the next folk to discover the site. Besilmer was a realm of pastures and cropland. The dwarves established an underground stronghold called Tyar-Besil beneath the Sumber Hills to defend against the trolls and giants that plagued the region.

Trolls and giants soon broke the realm of Besilmer, and the remaining dwarves abandoned the place altogether.": "贝西尔默的矮人是下一个发现这个地方的人。贝西尔默是一个牧场和农田的王国。矮人在桑伯山下建立了一个名为Tyar-Besil的地下堡垒，以抵御困扰该地区的巨魔和巨人。矮人在自己的洞穴下发现了古老的鸦人据点和它的神庙。他们缺乏清理废墟的力量，所以他们放弃了更深的挖掘工作。巨魔和巨人很快就打破了贝西尔默的领域，剩下的矮人也完全放弃了这个地方。",
	"Over the years, adventurers occasionally stumbled across the buried stronghold of Tyar-Besil and the drow vaults below it. Few made any lasting record of their explorations, and their names are forgotten. But in the year 893 DR (using the Dalereckoning calendar, about 600 years before the present day), a band of adventurers called the Knights of the Silver Horn found the place and commenced an exploration of the ruins. The adventurers came back to Tyar-Besil again and again, and when they decided to establish strongholds and tame the territory, they raised their keeps over each of the known access points leading to the ancient dwarven ruins. The adventurers feared something in the deep caves below the Sumber Hills, and they intended to set a permanent watch over the area.": "多年来，冒险家们偶尔会偶然发现被埋葬的泰尔-贝西尔的据点和它下面的乌鸦金库。很少有人对他们的探索做任何持久的记录，他们的名字也被遗忘。但是在公元893年（使用达勒克宁历法，大约比现在早600年），一队被称为银角骑士的冒险者发现了这个地方，并开始对废墟进行探索。冒险家们一次又一次地回到泰尔-贝西尔，当他们决定建立据点并驯服这片领土时，他们在通往古代矮人遗迹的每个已知的通道上建立了自己的堡垒。冒险家们担心桑伯山下的深洞里有什么东西，他们打算对该地区进行长期监视。",
	"History didn't cooperate. A generation or two after the Knights of the Silver Horn established their strongholds, an orc horde swept through the North, and the keeps were overrun. For centuries they stood empty. Locals came to know them as the Haunted Keeps, and various monsters occasionally occupied the ruins.": "历史并不配合。在银角骑士团建立据点的一两代之后，兽人部落横扫北方，堡垒被攻陷。几个世纪以来，它们一直空着。当地人将其称为 \"闹鬼的堡垒\"，各种怪物偶尔会占据这些废墟。",
	"The abandoned keeps and the dwarven stronghold beneath them might have been forgotten forever, but a few years ago a drow named Vizeran DeVir returned to the ancient Fane of the Eye. A renegade drow wizard of great power, DeVir was no servant of Lolth; like the forgotten sect that created the temple long ago, he devoted himself to the nameless power of the Elder Elemental Eye. His beliefs led to his exile from drow society, but his faithfulness to this dark power did not go unrewarded. Guided by visions, Vizeran DeVir created four mighty weapons imbued with Elemental Evil: the spear {@item Windvane|PotA}, the dagger {@item Tinderstrike|PotA}, the trident {@item Drown|PotA}, and the war pick {@item Ironfang|PotA}. He left these weapons on the altar of the Elder Elemental Eye for their fated bearers to discover.": "废弃的堡垒和其下的矮人据点可能已经被永远遗忘了，但几年前，一个名叫维泽兰-德维尔的鸦人回到了古老的眼之窗。DeVir是一个具有强大力量的叛逆的乌鸦巫师，他不是洛尔思的仆人；就像很久以前创建神庙的被遗忘的教派一样，他把自己献给了上古元素之眼的无名力量。他的信仰导致他被流放出鸦人社会，但他对这种黑暗力量的忠诚并没有得到回报。在幻觉的指引下，维泽兰-德维尔创造了四种被元素邪恶所浸染的强大武器：长矛（%0%）、匕首（%1%）、三叉戟（%2%）和战镐（%3%）。他把这些武器留在长老元素之眼的祭坛上，让它们的宿命持有者去发现。",
	"Within the last few months, each of the four elemental prophets was driven to seek out the ancient altar by dreams or visions. One by one, {@creature Aerisi Kalinoth|PotA}, {@creature Vanifer|PotA}, {@creature Gar Shatterkeel|PotA}, and {@creature Marlos Urnrayle|PotA} claimed their weapons and became the leaders of their respective cults. The four prophets established themselves in the ruins of dwarven Tyar-Besil and occupied the Haunted Keeps that guard access to the vast dungeon. Lunatics, outlaws, power-hungry villains, and monsters of all description began to trickle into the valley, drawn by the dark call of Elemental Evil. Meanwhile, the prophets experimented with their new toys, nurturing the seeds of elemental nodes that grew larger every day and testing their powers to create ever-larger natural disasters.": "在过去的几个月里，四个元素先知中的每一个都被梦境或幻觉所驱使，去寻找古老的祭坛。一个接一个，{@creature Aerisi Kalinoth|PotA}、{@creature Vanifer|PotA}、{@creature Gar Shatterkeel|PotA}和{@creature Marlos Urnrayle|PotA}认领了他们的武器，并成为他们各自教派的领袖。这四位先知在矮人泰尔-贝西尔的废墟中建立了自己的势力，并占领了守卫通往巨大地宫的鬼堡。疯子、亡命之徒、渴望权力的恶棍和各种类型的怪物开始涌入山谷，被邪恶元素的黑暗召唤所吸引。同时，先知们用他们的新玩具进行实验，培育出的元素节点的种子一天比一天大，并测试他们的力量，创造出越来越大的自然灾害。",
	"After thousands of years, the seeds of Elemental Evil once again sprout beneath the Sumber Hills. Whether anyone can expose these sinister plots and put a stop to them remains to be seen.": "几千年后，元素邪恶的种子再次在桑伯山下发芽。是否有人能揭露这些险恶的阴谋并制止它们，还有待观察。",
	"The adventure begins when the characters arrive in the town of Red Larch, a small settlement on the western side of the Dessarin Valley. Strange rumors and ominous signs have the townsfolk concerned, including reports of bandit attacks on the roads, piracy on the Dessarin River, and monster sightings too close to town. But the mystery that has keen observers of the region most concerned is the disappearance of a delegation traveling overland from the city of Mirabar to Waterdeep. The delegation stopped in the tiny village of Beliard, where the members mentioned their intent to visit sacred dwarven sites before continuing on to Goldenfields. They were last seen at the west end of the Stone Bridge, turning south to proceed overland through the heart of the Sumber Hills. It has now been almost a month, and the delegation never showed up at Goldenfields or any other outpost.": "冒险开始于人物到达红松镇，一个位于德萨林谷西侧的小定居点。奇怪的传言和不祥的征兆让镇民们忧心忡忡，包括公路上的强盗袭击、德萨林河上的海盗行为以及在镇子附近看到的怪物。但最让该地区敏锐的观察家们担心的谜团是一个从米拉巴尔城到沃特德普的陆路旅行代表团的失踪。该代表团在贝利亚德（Beliard）的小村庄停了下来，成员们在那里提到他们打算在继续前往金矿区之前参观矮人的圣地。他们最后一次被看到是在石桥的西端，转向南方，从陆路穿过桑伯山的中心地带。现在已经过去了将近一个月，代表团从未在金田镇或任何其他前哨出现过。",
	"Powerful factions have good reason to worry about the missing delegation. The Harpers are concerned about a noted dwarf historian who was part of the delegation. The Emerald Enclave wants to know what happened to a pouch of magical seeds one of the delegation members was bringing to Goldenfields. Even the Zhentarim are interested in trying to improve their relations with Mirabar by helping to solve the mystery. Whether the characters set out to search for the missing delegation or choose to investigate another lead, they soon find clues that lead them to the Haunted Keeps in the Sumber Hills. All of these are now occupied by strange new sects masquerading as harmless societies or reclusive orders, but these outposts serve Elemental Evil.": "强大的派别有充分的理由担心代表团的失踪。哈珀人担心一位著名的矮人历史学家，他也是代表团的成员。翡翠飞地想知道代表团成员之一带往金地的一袋魔法种子发生了什么。甚至连Zhentarim也有兴趣通过帮助解开这个谜团来试图改善他们与Mirabar的关系。无论人物是开始寻找失踪的代表团，还是选择调查另一条线索，他们很快就找到了线索，将他们引向桑伯山的闹鬼堡。所有这些地方现在都被奇怪的新教派占据，它们伪装成无害的社团或隐居的命令，但这些前哨站都为元素邪恶服务。",
	"When the characters infiltrate or defeat these disguised groups of cultists, they discover that each Haunted Keep guards a passage leading to a huge dungeon beneath the Sumber Hills, the new Temple of Elemental Evil. Here, the elemental cults have established themselves in the ruins of an ancient dwarven stronghold. They are building up their strength as they work to master elemental power. The characters come up against the elemental prophets and confront one of the four cult leaders, whose identity depends on which part of the temple the characters explore first.": "当人物潜入或击败这些伪装的邪教组织时，他们发现每个鬼堡都守卫着一条通道，通往桑伯山下的巨大地牢，即新的元素邪恶神殿。在这里，元素邪教已经在一个古老的矮人据点的废墟中建立了自己的势力。他们在努力掌握元素力量的同时也在积蓄力量。角色们与元素预言家们对峙，并与四个邪教领袖中的一个对抗，他们的身份取决于角色们首先探索神庙的哪个部分。",
	"Even as the characters delve into the elemental temples, their successes provoke retaliation. The elemental prophets dispatch bands of cultists armed with {@item Devastation Orb|PotA|devastation orbs}—essentially bombs of elemental energy created from the elemental nodes—to unleash natural disasters throughout the Dessarin Valley, punishing everyone for the characters' interference.": "即使人物深入到元素神庙中，他们的成功也会引起报复。元素预言家们派遣了一批手持（%0%）--基本上是由元素节点产生的元素能量炸弹的邪教徒，在整个德萨林谷释放自然灾害，对人物的干预进行惩罚。",
	"Despite fierce opposition in the various elemental temples and the retribution of the offended cults, the characters succeed in rescuing some of the Mirabar delegates and driving out some or all of the cults from their newly established bases in Tyar-Besil. Unfortunately, other members of the delegation remain missing, and various other leads and mysteries remain unresolved. Worse yet, it quickly becomes clear that the elemental cults are on the brink of unleashing unthinkable disasters.": "尽管各元素神庙中存在激烈的反对意见，而且被冒犯的邪教也会进行报复，但这些人物还是成功地救出了一些米拉巴尔的代表，并将一些或所有的邪教赶出了他们在泰尔-贝西尔新建立的基地。不幸的是，代表团的其他成员仍然失踪，其他各种线索和谜团仍然没有得到解决。更糟糕的是，很快就可以看出，元素邪教正处于释放不可想象的灾难的边缘。",
	"As an elemental apocalypse grows nearer, the characters discover passages leading from the cult-controlled territory in Tyar-Besil to the far older (and more dangerous) caverns known as the Fane of the Eye, dug long ago by drow. Here they find the evil altar dedicated to the Elder Elemental Eye, where the characters confront another of the elemental prophets (again, the prophet they fight depends on which part of the dungeon they explore first). They also find passages leading into the ultimate sanctums of the cults: the elemental nodes known as the Black Geode, the Howling Caverns, the Plunging Torrents, and the Weeping Colossus.": "随着元素启示的日益临近，角色们发现了从Tyar-Besil的邪教控制区通往更古老（也更危险）的洞穴的通道，这些洞穴被称为 \"眼睛之窗\"，是很久以前由鸦人挖掘的。他们在这里找到了供奉长老元素之眼的邪恶祭坛，人物在这里与另一位元素先知对峙（同样，他们与哪位先知战斗取决于他们先探索地牢的哪一部分）。他们还发现了通往邪教终极圣地的通道：被称为黑晶石（Black Geode）、嚎叫洞穴（Howling Caverns）、急流（Plunging Torrents）和哭泣巨人（Weeping Colossus）的元素结点。",
	"In the last stage of the adventure, the characters face the daunting task of pursuing the remaining two elemental prophets into their places of power. The most powerful and dedicated followers of each of the four cults guard these sanctums, which are infused with elemental energy and warped into strange reflections of the Elemental Planes. At the heart of each elemental node, the characters find a great portal that serves as a conduit from its associated elemental plane. Here the remaining cult leaders make their stands, and here the characters face the overwhelming power of the Princes of Elemental Evil. Victory might seem doubtful against such opponents, but clever and resourceful characters can find ways to destroy the portals instead of trying to slay these dire beings.": "在冒险的最后阶段，角色们面临着一项艰巨的任务，那就是追捕剩下的两位元素先知，进入他们的权力之所。四个邪教中最强大、最虔诚的追随者守护着这些圣地，这些圣地被注入了元素能量，并被扭曲成元素界的奇怪反映。在每个元素节点的中心，角色们会发现一个巨大的传送门，作为相关元素界的通道。在这里，剩余的邪教领袖们做出了他们的决定，而在这里，角色们面临着元素邪恶王子们的压倒性力量。面对这样的对手，胜利似乎很值得怀疑，但聪明机智的角色可以找到摧毁传送门的方法，而不是试图杀死这些可怕的生物。",
	"With the portals shut, the elemental nodes revert to normal, and any surviving cultists scatter to the four winds. Their stronghold is destroyed and their leaders are dead; Elemental Evil is defeated in this world for now.": "随着传送门的关闭，元素节点恢复正常，任何幸存的邪教徒都四散奔逃。他们的据点被摧毁了，他们的领袖也死了；元素邪恶在这个世界上暂时被打败了。",
	"Elemental Evil perverts the natural elements, limiting them to aspects of destruction. This force wants to gain the power to tear down everything—morals, social structures, governments, the laws of nature—and reduce existence to a more elemental state, tainted with conflict and madness. Elemental Evil uses mortal servants as a means to this end.": "元素邪恶扭曲了自然元素，将它们限制在破坏的方面。这股力量想要获得拆毁一切的力量--道德、社会结构、政府、自然法则--并将存在降低到一个更原始的状态，沾染上冲突和疯狂。元素邪恶利用凡人的仆人作为实现这一目的的手段。",
	"These hateful principles take two primary forms in the world. The first is corruption. Elemental Evil tempts the broken, the wronged, and the wicked with the power to strike back. It represents the worm in the apple, a hidden corruption that grows stronger over time as the natural order decays. Secret cults spring up, institutions are debased, and the fundamental laws governing the seasons begin to weaken. As Elemental Evil grows stronger, its corruption grows into the second form: madness. Cultists sink into insanity, lashing out at everything around them or destroying themselves in elemental cataclysms. Ruin rules as the forces of nature become instruments of destruction. A world in which Elemental Evil triumphed would exist only as an everlasting war of raging elements.": "这些可恨的原则在世界范围内有两种主要形式。第一种是腐败。元素邪恶诱惑着破碎的人、受委屈的人和有能力反击的邪恶者。它代表着苹果中的虫子，是一种隐藏的腐败，随着时间的推移，自然秩序的衰败而变得越来越强大。秘密邪教涌现，机构被贬低，管理四季的基本法律开始削弱。随着元素邪恶越来越强大，它的腐败也发展成第二种形式：疯狂。崇拜者陷入疯狂，对周围的一切进行抨击，或在元素大灾难中毁灭自己。当自然界的力量成为毁灭的工具时，毁灭就成为了统治。一个元素之恶取得胜利的世界将只存在于一场永恒的元素之战中。",
	"Elemental Evil appears in different worlds throughout the many ages. This sinister force—the Elder Elemental Eye—is well hidden in Faerûn. Individuals remain susceptible to its call: those lured by the promise of power, those who know only hate in their hearts, those whose minds are broken and therefore open to insinuation and dark whispers. These are the servants of Elemental Evil, and they can cause immeasurable harm if they aren't exposed and rooted out.": "元素的邪恶出现在不同的世界，贯穿了许多时代。这种邪恶的力量--长老元素之眼--在法鲁恩隐藏得很好。个人仍然容易受到它的召唤：那些被权力的承诺所引诱的人，那些心中只有仇恨的人，那些心灵被破坏的人，因此对暗示和黑暗的低语开放。这些人是元素邪恶的仆人，如果他们不被揭露和根除，他们会造成不可估量的伤害。",
	"Although destruction is the unifying principle of Elemental Evil, beings that serve this dark force don't necessarily adhere to that goal. Only the most unbalanced minds seek destruction for its own sake. Instead, the servants of Elemental Evil seek power through the destructive might of one of the elements of air, earth, fire, or water. This is the origin of the four elemental cults that together compose the worship of Elemental Evil.": "虽然毁灭是元素邪恶的统一原则，但为这种黑暗力量服务的生命不一定坚持这一目标。只有最不平衡的头脑才会为了毁灭而寻求毁灭。相反，元素邪恶的仆人们通过空气、地球、火或水等元素之一的破坏力来寻求力量。这就是四个元素邪教的起源，它们共同构成了对元素邪教的崇拜。",
	"The cults operate independently of each other. Each believes that its favored element is the most powerful and most worthy of worship. Rank-and-file members of the air cult sneer at the idea that anyone could see something worth worshiping in elemental earth, fire, or water. Members of the other cults feel the same way about any cult but their own. Only the best-educated or most magically gifted members understand that a unifying principle underlies each elemental cult. Even then, they believe that their element should reign supreme.": "这些邪教相互独立运作。每个人都相信自己喜欢的元素是最强大的，最值得崇拜的。空气邪教的普通成员对任何人都能在土、火或水元素中看到值得崇拜的东西的想法嗤之以鼻。其他邪教的成员对任何邪教都有同样的感觉，除了他们自己的。只有受过最好教育或最有魔法天赋的成员才明白，每个元素邪教都有一个统一的原则。即使如此，他们也认为他们的元素应该是至高无上的。",
	"Despite these different goals and varying methods, the elemental cults are linked to each other by forces they don't fully understand. From world to world and age to age, the cults of Elemental Evil have risen again and again. Each time, the cultists of elemental air, earth, fire, and water are joined to the same dark fate.": "尽管有这些不同的目标和不同的方法，元素邪教被他们不完全理解的力量联系在一起。从一个世界到另一个世界，从一个时代到另一个时代，元素邪恶的邪教一次又一次地兴起。每一次，空气、地球、火和水元素的崇拜者都会加入到同一个黑暗命运中。",
	"Throughout the adventure, characters have ample opportunity to see the symbol associated with each of the four cults. They could figure out how the four symbols connect to form a fifth symbol: that of the Elder Elemental Eye.": "在整个冒险过程中，人物有充分的机会看到与四个教派中的每一个相关的符号。他们可以弄清楚这四个符号是如何连接起来形成第五个符号的：长老元素之眼的符号。",
	"The Cult of the Black Earth appeals to those who draw their fortunes from the earth—directly or indirectly. In areas where the influence of Elemental Evil takes hold, animals and monsters that live or burrow in the ground accept the cultists as allies. Creatures such as ankhegs or bulettes, normally too stupid and ravenous to be trained, submit to the will of the Black Earth. The monsters allow themselves to be herded or ridden into battle against the enemies of the cult.": "黑土教吸引了那些直接或间接地从地球上获取财富的人。在受元素邪恶影响的地区，生活在地下或钻在地下的动物和怪物会接受邪教者为盟友。像Ankhegs或bulettes这样的生物，通常太过愚蠢和贪婪而无法被训练，但却服从于黑土的意志。这些怪物允许自己被驱赶或骑在马上与邪教的敌人作战。",
	"The symbol of the earth cult signifies purpose and stability. Cultists sometimes identify themselves with a hand gesture: they make a triangle by touching the thumbs and forefingers of both hands together.": "大地崇拜的标志象征着目标和稳定。崇拜者有时会用一个手势来表明自己的身份：他们把双手的拇指和食指碰在一起，做成一个三角形。",
	"The Black Earth cult is the most defense-minded and patient of the four elemental cults. Earth cultists admire stoicism, endurance, and unyielding resolve. They are deliberate and slow to act, careful to consider their plans and gather their strength before beginning any new enterprise. Once earth cultists resolve to act, they are inflexible, grinding their way forward through any obstacle or unforeseen development. They are single-minded in the extreme, and most earth cultists have little use for social niceties. They see common courtesy as a way for the weak to put limits on the behavior of the strong, and they scorn empathy or friendship as weakness.": "黑土邪教是四个元素邪教中最具防御意识和耐心的。大地崇拜者推崇坚忍不拔的精神、耐力和不屈的决心。他们深思熟虑，行动迟缓，在开始任何新的事业之前，都会仔细考虑他们的计划并聚集他们的力量。一旦地球崇拜者下定决心采取行动，他们就会不屈不挠，在任何障碍或不可预见的发展中磨练自己的前进道路。他们极端地一意孤行，而且大多数大地崇拜者对社会礼节没有什么用处。他们认为普通的礼貌是弱者对强者的行为施加限制的一种方式，他们蔑视同情或友谊，认为这是弱者。",
	"In battle, Black Earth cultists are brutal and straightforward. They overpower foes with direct assaults, although if they have the opportunity to undermine defenses or attack from below, they unhesitatingly put their skill at tunneling and mastery of burrowing monsters to good use. They are unflinching in the face of death. Surrender is never an option.": "在战斗中，黑土崇拜者是残酷而直接的。他们用直接攻击来制服敌人，尽管如果他们有机会破坏防御或从下面攻击，他们会毫不犹豫地把他们的隧道技术和对钻地怪物的掌握用在这里。他们在面对死亡时毫不退缩。投降从来不是一种选择。",
	"Earth cultists live and work underground. They craft weapons from stone or iron and \"bathe\" themselves in sand or dirt to feel close to their favored element. Black Earth initiates know the secret of creating armor from magically shaped stone, and even their robes include stone pauldrons or masks.": "大地崇拜者在地下生活和工作。他们用石头或铁制作武器，并在沙子或泥土中 \"沐浴\"，以感觉接近他们所喜爱的元素。黑土教的入门者知道用魔法形状的石头制造盔甲的秘密，甚至他们的长袍上也有石质的长柄或面具。",
	"A medusa named {@creature Marlos Urnrayle|PotA} leads the Black Earth cult. He wields the elemental weapon {@item Ironfang|PotA}, a war pick infused with the power of {@creature Ogrémoch|PotA}, the Prince of Evil Earth. Marlos is vain and cruel, an extreme narcissist who delights in surrounding himself with objects of beauty and luxurious comforts. Beneath this sneering self-assurance lies a bitter being who loathes himself and holds everyone around him in contempt.": "一个名叫{@creature Marlos Urnrayle|PotA}的美杜莎领导着黑土教派。他挥舞着元素武器（%%1%），这是一把注入了邪恶地球王子（%%2%）力量的战刀。马洛斯虚荣而残忍，是个极端的自恋者，喜欢用美丽的物品和奢华的舒适来包围自己。在这种讥讽的自我肯定之下，是一个厌恶自己并蔑视周围所有人的痛苦的存在。",
	"Marlos began life as a human aristocrat, born into a wealthy Cormyrean family. He squandered his family's wealth on endless self-indulgence, seeking more questionable forms of entertainment through the years. The Urnrayle estate became known as a place of outrageous masquerades, bizarre banquets, and grotesque orgies. Marlos required his guests to don ugly or monstrous masks, thus ensuring that no one's beauty would outshine his own.": "马洛斯开始了作为人类贵族的生活，出生在一个富裕的科米雷家族。他把家族的财富挥霍在无休止的自我放纵上，多年来寻求更多可疑的娱乐形式。厄恩雷尔庄园成为著名的离谱的化妆舞会、怪异的宴会和怪诞的狂欢之地。马洛斯要求他的客人戴上丑陋或畸形的面具，从而确保没有人的美貌会超过他自己。",
	"As he aged, Marlos turned to magic to preserve his fading beauty. After searching for years, he found a ring that contained the stolen vitality of a lovely fey creature. As long as he wore the ring, his imperfections vanished and no one could resist his physical charms—until the day the ring transformed Marlos into a medusa. The horror of his fate drove Marlos mad. He fled his ancestral home, taking his collection of masks with him.": "随着年龄的增长，马洛斯转而求助于魔法，以保持他逐渐消失的美丽。经过多年的寻找，他找到了一枚戒指，里面有一个可爱的精灵生物的偷来的活力。只要他戴上这枚戒指，他的缺陷就会消失，没有人能够抵挡他的身体魅力--直到有一天，这枚戒指把马洛斯变成了一只美杜莎。命运的恐怖使马洛斯发疯了。他带着他收集的面具逃离了他的祖屋。",
	"After years of wandering and hiding in one ruined estate or another across the Western Heartlands, Marlos felt drawn to the desolate Sumber Hills by troubling dreams and visions. A long stairway beneath a ruined monastery brought him to an ancient cavern with a hideous altar, upon which lay a war pick of iron. When the medusa claimed {@item Ironfang|PotA}, his purpose finally became clear to him. He established his lair in the dungeon nearby and began building the Cult of the Black Earth.": "在西部心脏地带的一个或另一个破败的庄园里流浪和躲藏多年后，马洛斯感到被令人不安的梦和幻觉吸引到了荒凉的桑伯山。一座破败的修道院下的长梯将他带到一个古老的洞穴，里面有一个可怕的祭坛，上面躺着一把铁制的战镐。当美杜莎要求{@item Ironfang|PotA}时，他的目的终于变得清晰起来。他在附近的地牢里建立了自己的巢穴，并开始建立黑土教。",
	"Unlike many of his followers, Marlos is genteel and well-spoken. He delights in witty banter and pointed repartee, although he is quick to make a cutting remark or jest at someone else's expense. Marlos takes pleasure in mocking others, especially if he can do so in a clever or elegant way. Marlos's previous life had been a constant search for pleasure, but the only thing that now stirs his loveless soul is refined cruelty. He can be driven to fits of blind, unreasoning jealousy if he is outshone by another urbane and attractive individual.": "与他的许多追随者不同，马洛斯风度翩翩，谈吐得体。他喜欢诙谐的戏谑和尖锐的对答，尽管他很快就会说些尖锐的话语或以别人的利益为代价开玩笑。马洛斯以嘲弄他人为乐，特别是如果他能以一种聪明或优雅的方式这样做。马洛斯以前的生活一直在寻找快乐，但现在唯一能激起他无爱的灵魂的是精致的残忍。如果他被另一个彬彬有礼的有魅力的人比下去了，他就会被驱赶到盲目的、无理的嫉妒中。",
	"The Black Earth cultists are highly suspicious of the Cult of Howling Hatred. They believe that the air cultists are mercurial, unreliable, and generally out of touch with reality. The earth cultists respect the strength and ferocity of the Eternal Flame followers, but also find them maddeningly inconstant. Black Earth cultists ally most often with the Crushing Wave, since they admire the patience and pragmatism of the water cultists.": "黑土邪教的人对嚎叫的仇恨邪教高度怀疑。他们认为空气邪教的人是水银泻地，不可靠的，而且通常与现实脱节。大地崇拜者尊重永恒之火追随者的力量和凶猛，但也发现他们令人抓狂的不稳定。黑土教派最常与碎浪教派结盟，因为他们欣赏水教派的耐心和实用主义。",
	"The Crushing Wave cult appeals to those who live in or near bodies of water, as well as to those who appreciate subtlety and inevitability. Wicked sea creatures such as aquatic ghouls and merrows are friendly toward water cultists. Even non-sentient predators such as sharks or octopuses understand that water cultists are allies to be aided or masters to be obeyed.": "碎浪教吸引了那些生活在水体中或附近的人，以及那些欣赏微妙和不可避免性的人。邪恶的海洋生物，如水生食尸鬼和美人鱼，对水崇拜者很友好。即使是鲨鱼或章鱼等无知觉的掠食者也明白，水崇拜者是需要帮助的盟友或需要服从的主人。",
	"Water cultists use a simple hand sign to identify one another when a token of recognition is required: crossing the forefingers and overlapping the thumbs to create an X-shape linked by a line across the bottom. It stands for water's eternal surge and retreat, a cycle of unending change.": "水崇拜者使用一个简单的手势来识别彼此的身份，当需要确认的时候：食指交叉，拇指重叠，形成一个X形，底部有一条线连接。它代表着水的永恒涌动和退却，一个无休止变化的循环。",
	"Crushing Wave cultists are almost as patient and stoic as the followers of the earth cult. They understand the value of outlasting formidable foes and slowly eroding their defenses. However, they are far more flexible and opportunistic in their overall philosophy than the earth cultists are. Like a flood that seeks the weak point in a levee and then bursts through with ever-growing strength, water cultists are quick to sense an opening and then act to exploit it. This philosophy of pragmatism and opportunism means that the Crushing Wave is the most mercenary of the four elemental cults. Water cultists eagerly seek out rich prizes and use their ill-gotten loot to develop their schemes.": "碎浪邪教的信徒几乎和大地邪教的信徒一样有耐心和坚忍。他们了解战胜强大的敌人并慢慢侵蚀其防御的价值。然而，他们在整体理念上要比大地崇拜者灵活得多、机会主义得多。就像洪水寻找堤坝的薄弱点，然后以不断增长的力量冲破堤坝一样，水崇拜者很快就能感觉到一个缺口，然后采取行动来利用它。这种实用主义和机会主义的哲学意味着破碎浪潮是四个元素邪教中最雇佣的。水崇拜者热衷于寻找丰富的奖品，并利用他们不义之财来发展他们的计划。",
	"In combat, Crushing Wave cultists excel as skirmishers. They value mobility and opportunism, rarely making a stand in one place for long. Instead, they feign retreats, regroup, and launch new attacks, wearing down their foes like storm-driven waves eating away at a sandy beach. Almost all water cultists are excellent swimmers skilled at fighting in water, so they look for opportunities to surprise their enemies by using bodies of water to slip around or through defenses.": "在战斗中，破碎浪潮的邪教徒擅长做小兵。他们重视机动性和机会主义，很少在一个地方长期驻扎。相反，他们会假装撤退，重新集结，然后发动新的攻击，就像风暴驱动的海浪侵蚀沙滩一样消磨他们的敌人。几乎所有的水崇拜者都是优秀的游泳者，擅长在水中作战，所以他们寻找机会，利用水体绕过或穿过防线，给敌人一个惊喜。",
	"Because the cultists see water as the wellspring of all life and purpose, they spend as much time in or around it as possible. Many cult hideouts are located near large bodies of water, and those that aren't feature hidden pools or wells in which cult members can immerse themselves. Water cultists prize water-breathing magic and seek it out for no other reason than to spend hours meditating underwater. Few cultists gain any profound insights from these exercises.": "由于邪教成员将水视为所有生命和目的的源泉，他们尽可能多地在水里或周围度过。许多邪教的藏身之处都位于大型水体附近，而那些没有的地方则有隐藏的水池或水井，邪教成员可以将自己浸泡在其中。水上邪教的信徒非常重视水呼吸的魔法，他们寻找水呼吸的原因无非是为了在水下花几个小时进行冥想。很少有邪教成员从这些练习中获得任何深刻的见解。",
	"The former sailor {@creature Gar Shatterkeel|PotA} leads the Crushing Wave cult. He wields the elemental weapon {@item Drown|PotA}, a trident imbued with the essence of {@creature Olhydra|PotA}, Princess of Evil Water. Gar is a sullen man who says little, letting his actions speak for him. He believes he has been wronged by the world and hates all people except those as broken and unfortunate as himself. Gar also despises weakness in others.": "前水手（%0%）领导碎浪教派。他挥舞着元素武器（%%1%），这是一把灌注了恶水公主（%%2%）精华的三叉戟。加尔是一个闷闷不乐的人，他很少说话，让他的行为来代表他。他认为自己被世界所冤枉，除了那些像他一样破碎和不幸的人，他憎恨所有的人。加尔还鄙视他人的弱点。",
	"Gar was born in a poor fishing village in the Nelanther Isles. At a young age, he lost his family to a sahuagin attack. The sea devils slaughtered almost everyone he knew. A Tethyrian merchant galley conscripted the young orphan into service, and Gar was forced into a brutal indentured servitude that was barely better than being enslaved. His unwilling service came to an end when pirates attacked the merchant ship. During the fighting, Gar was knocked overboard. For days he survived by clinging to the ship's wreckage, until a shark ripped off his left arm. Death seemed imminent, but a powerful current arose and bore him away from the hungry predator. Within an hour he was cast upon the shores of the Sword Coast.": "加尔出生在内兰瑟群岛的一个贫穷的渔村。在他很小的时候，他的家人就在萨瓦金人的袭击中丧生。海妖们几乎屠杀了他认识的所有人。一艘泰特里亚商船征召这个年轻的孤儿服役，加尔被迫接受残酷的契约奴役，勉强比被奴役好一点。当海盗袭击商船时，他不情愿的服务就结束了。在战斗中，加尔被打翻在地。几天来，他紧紧抓住船上的残骸，直到一条鲨鱼撕下了他的左臂。死亡似乎迫在眉睫，但一股强大的水流将他从饥饿的掠食者身边冲走。在一个小时内，他被扔到了剑海岸的海岸上。",
	"Gar believed that the current that had saved his life was an elemental sent by the sea. From that day forward, he devoted himself to the ocean, teaching himself its secrets and learning powerful water magic over years of lonely wandering. He despised all other people, remembering only his harsh treatment by the merchant crew and the brutality of the pirates. But in time he became aware of a call to a higher purpose, impelling him to find other examples of human flotsam and teach them about the power of the sea.": "加尔相信，救他一命的水流是大海派来的元素。从那天起，他就把自己献给了海洋，在多年的孤独漂泊中自学了海洋的秘密和强大的水魔法。他鄙视所有其他人，只记得他受到商船船员的严厉对待和海盗的残暴。但随着时间的推移，他意识到一种对更高目标的呼唤，促使他去寻找其他人类的浮尸，并向他们传授海洋的力量。",
	"Gar's visions led him to the secret waters beneath the Sumber Hills. He found a hidden cavern temple, on whose altar lay a powerful magical trident. Sensing its power, Gar took up the weapon and began to call his cult to join him in the Temple of the Crushing Wave.": "加尔的幻觉将他引向桑伯山下的秘密水域。他发现了一个隐藏的洞穴寺庙，在其祭坛上有一个强大的魔法三叉戟。感受到它的力量，加尔拿起武器，开始召唤他的崇拜者加入他的碎浪寺。",
	"Gar is covered in barnacles, and he wears an artificial arm in the shape of a crab's claw over the stump of his left arm. He never uses two words when one will do, and he believes that anyone addressing him with courtesy is either insincere or subtly mocking him. The water prophet's primary motivation is retribution; the world has been cruel to him, and he intends to make everyone else suffer as he has. He longs to be near the ocean again and is distressed by the fact that the driving force behind his visions keeps him so far from the sea.": "加尔浑身都是藤壶，他的左臂残肢上戴着一只蟹爪形状的假臂。他从来不用两个字，而用一个字就可以了，他认为任何人以礼相待都是不真诚的，或者是在巧妙地嘲弄他。水先知的主要动机是报应；世界对他很残酷，他打算让其他人也像他一样受苦。他渴望再次接近海洋，并为他的幻觉背后的驱动力使他远离大海而感到痛苦。",
	"The followers of the Crushing Wave detest the Cult of the Eternal Flame. They find the fire cultists to be hostile, short-tempered, and unforgivably rash. The Howling Hatred cultists aren't as hostile, but they are likewise given to sudden impulses and are unreliable. The water cultists get along with the Cult of the Black Earth. The earth cultists are deliberate and dependable, if perhaps too inflexible for their own good.": "碎浪的追随者厌恶永恒火焰的崇拜。他们发现火崇拜者充满敌意，脾气暴躁，而且不可原谅地轻率。嚎叫的仇恨教派没有那么多敌意，但他们也同样会有突然的冲动，而且不可靠。水崇拜者与黑土崇拜者相处融洽。大地崇拜者是深思熟虑和可靠的，尽管可能对他们自己来说太不灵活了。",
	"The Eternal Flame appeals to those drawn to destruction for its own sake. Creatures of elemental fire are most likely to take up this reckless philosophy; even non-intelligent fire monsters sense the reckless lust for destruction lurking in the hearts of fire cultists and consider Eternal Flame believers to be their allies.": "永恒之火吸引着那些为了毁灭而被吸引的人。火元素的生物最有可能接受这种鲁莽的哲学；甚至非智能的火怪也能感觉到潜伏在火崇拜者心中的鲁莽的毁灭欲望，并认为永恒之焰的信徒是他们的盟友。",
	"The symbol of the fire cult is reminiscent of a bowl-like brazier with a burning flame. Fire cultists sometimes identify themselves with a symbolic hand sign: holding one hand in a fist, thumb up, and laying the other hand over the fist as if to cover the bowl but allow the flame to show. Members of the cult can also be identified by their burn scars.": "火崇拜的标志让人联想到一个碗状的钎子，上面有燃烧的火焰。火崇拜者有时会用一个象征性的手势来表明自己的身份：一只手握拳，拇指向上，另一只手放在拳头上，好像要盖住碗，但允许火焰露出来。该邪教的成员也可以通过他们的烧伤疤痕来识别。",
	"Fire cultists are impetuous, hot-tempered, and violent. They aren't mindless savages; their impetuousness also encompasses fiendish inventiveness and a drive to devise new tools for their mad cause. They are masters of fire and forge, taking captives to work in their infernal foundries. Fire cultists see conquest and enslavement of the weak as necessary steps in bringing about the chaos they intend to unleash on the world.": "火崇拜者是急躁的、脾气暴躁的和暴力的。他们不是无意识的野蛮人；他们的急躁也包含了恶魔般的创造力和为他们的疯狂事业设计新工具的动力。他们是火和锻造的大师，会把俘虏带到他们的地狱铸造厂里工作。火崇拜者认为征服和奴役弱者是实现他们打算在世界范围内释放的混乱的必要步骤。",
	"In battle, fire cultists launch sudden, overwhelming assaults. They throw themselves into reckless attacks with no regard for their own lives, seeking to cause as much damage as possible before falling. They are fearless and would rather die fighting among a mob of enemies than retreat a single step.": "在战斗中，火崇拜者发起突然的、压倒性的攻击。他们不顾自己的生命，不顾一切地投入攻击，力求在倒下之前造成尽可能多的伤害。他们无所畏惧，宁可死在一群敌人中战斗，也不愿意退缩一步。",
	"Followers of the Eternal Flame cult surround themselves with the largest fires they can create. Their favorite tactic involves using magic to open volcanic fissures or vents and channel flows of molten rock. Widespread arson and deliberately set forest fires are acceptable alternatives. Most fire cultists believe that something important and beautiful should be set on fire every day, or else they're just not doing their part.": "永恒之火邪教的追随者用他们能创造的最大的火包围自己。他们最喜欢的策略是用魔法打开火山裂缝或通风口，引导熔岩流动。广泛的纵火和故意设置的森林大火是可以接受的替代方法。大多数火崇拜者认为，一些重要而美丽的东西应该每天都被点燃，否则他们就是没有尽到自己的责任。",

In her youth, she learned to dance for coin and slowly worked her way up from the wine sinks of the laborers' districts to the elegant chambers of the city's nobles. She mastered minor fire magic to distinguish herself from other dancers and incorporated flame into her routine. Her talents grew, and soon she caught the eye of a pasha and became his concubine. But even as she enjoyed the gifts he lavished on her, {@creature Vanifer|PotA} hated the pasha for seeing her as a mere trophy. She left before long, robbing the pasha of a small fortune in jewelry and setting fire to his palace.": "{@creature Vanifer|PotA}在卡里姆波特最贫穷的地区出生和长大，只靠她狡猾的智慧武装。在她年轻的时候，她学会了为钱而跳舞，并慢慢地从劳工区的酒池子里爬到了城市贵族的优雅房间里。她掌握了小的火魔法，以区别于其他舞者，并将火焰融入她的舞步。她的才能不断增长，很快她就引起了一位帕夏的注意，并成为他的妾。但即使她享受着他给她的礼物，{@creature Vanifer|PotA}也憎恨那个帕夏把她看作是一个单纯的战利品。她不久就离开了，抢走了帕夏的一小笔珠宝，并放火烧了他的宫殿。",

There she remained until a few months ago, when dreams and visions impelled her to seek out a lost dungeon in the North. On the altar of a forgotten temple she found the dagger {@item Tinderstrike|PotA}, imbued with the power of {@creature Imix|PotA}, the Prince of Evil Fire.

	"Eternal Flame cultists detest the followers of the Crushing Wave. They see the water cultists as slippery and untrustworthy, perhaps even cowardly—after all, the Crushing Wave retreats quickly from opposition and seeks the path of least resistance before committing its strength. The earth cultists are stolid and courageous, but maddeningly slow to act. The cultists of the Howling Hatred share the fire cult's impulse to act swiftly and show many of the same qualities of inventiveness and creativity in the service of Elemental Evil.": "永恒之火的崇拜者厌恶破碎之浪的追随者。在他们看来，水崇拜者滑头，不值得信任，甚至可能是懦弱的--毕竟，破碎浪潮在遇到反对时迅速撤退，在投入力量之前寻求阻力最小的路径。大地邪教的人固执而勇敢，但行动却慢得令人抓狂。嚎叫之恨的邪教徒与火邪教徒一样有迅速行动的冲动，并在为元素之恶服务时表现出许多同样的发明和创造的品质。",
	"The Cult of the Howling Hatred appeals to those who deal in perceptions over facts: illusionists, spies, and assassins, for example.

Hippogriffs, griffons, and giant vultures are frequently used as air cult steeds.": "仇恨嚎叫教吸引了那些以感知而非事实为交易对象的人：比如说幻术师、间谍和刺客。任何种类的掠夺性或凶猛的有翼生物，甚至是那些原本会抵制训练的无知觉的怪物，都会把空气崇拜者视为盟友并与他们合作。河马、狮鹫和巨大的秃鹰经常被用作空气崇拜者的坐骑。",
	"The symbol of elemental air is an inverted triangle with three branching lines above it. Some believe it stands for the funnel cloud of a tornado, while others see it as the superiority of winged creatures over the ground. Some maintain it is an ancient rune that stands for the elemental lord {@creature Yan-C-Bin|PotA}. Whatever their interpretations, the air cultists use the symbol as a secret password of sorts. By touching the thumbs and little fingers together and closing the rest of the fingers into a fist, an air cultist forms an inverted triangle that is a mark of membership in the cult.": "空气元素的象征是一个倒三角形，上面有三条分支线。有些人认为它代表着龙卷风的漏斗云，而其他人则认为它是有翼生物对地面的优势。有些人坚持认为它是一个古老的符文，代表着元素之主（%0%）。无论他们的解释是什么，空气崇拜者都把这个符号作为一种秘密的密码。通过将大拇指和小拇指碰在一起，并将其余手指合拢成拳头，空气崇拜者形成一个倒三角形，这是崇拜者的标志。",

In her dreams she began to envision herself as one of the winged elves from her storybooks. She wished to control the wind and go wherever she liked, and to punish those who offended her. The childlike fantasies of her youth became dark visions where she ruled the storms and the air itself. She dreamed of an old mystic with brown skin and white hair, who promised to teach her all she desired to know—a vision of {@creature Yan-C-Bin|PotA}, the Prince of Evil Air. Aerisi turned her study to elemental air, learning the secret of flight and escaping Evereska to follow the deluded visions of her dreams.": "爱丽斯在月精灵中感到无能为力。虽然她在精灵界已经成为一个熟练的魔法师，但她的人民对这种魅力有抵触。在她的梦中，她开始把自己想象成故事书中的有翼精灵之一。她希望能控制风，去她喜欢的地方，并惩罚那些冒犯她的人。她年轻时的童真幻想变成了黑暗的幻觉，在那里她统治着风暴和空气本身。她梦见一个棕色皮肤和白色头发的老神秘主义者，他答应教给她所有她想知道的东西--这是邪恶空气王子{@creature Yan-C-Bin|PotA}的愿景。爱丽斯将她的研究转向了空气元素，学会了飞行的秘密，并逃离了埃弗里斯卡，追随她梦中的妄想。",

	"No one can deny Aerisi's grace, but she also possesses a violent temper that reveals itself whenever she is denied what she wants. Aerisi is prone to flights of fancy and impulsive decadence. She doesn't see herself as evil because she lacks the capacity to empathize with anyone else. Those who worship and please her are good, and those who defy her are wicked and must be punished. Her wish to lash the world with storms and destruction is, at its root, a temper tantrum against the elven society that dared to impose its strictures on her.": "没有人可以否认艾里西的优雅，但她也拥有一个暴躁的脾气，每当她被剥夺了她想要的东西时，她就会暴露出来。爱丽斯容易胡思乱想，冲动颓废。她不认为自己是邪恶的，因为她缺乏同情别人的能力。那些崇拜和取悦她的人是好的，而那些违抗她的人是邪恶的，必须受到惩罚。她希望用风暴和毁灭来冲击世界，从根本上说，是对敢于对她强加限制的精灵社会的一种发脾气行为。",
	"The cultists of the Howling Hatred find the Black Earth cultists to be coarse, rude, unimaginative, and stubborn to the point of stupidity. Most offensively, the earth cultists are bluntly unimpressed by the Howling Hatred cult and its achievements. Followers of the Crushing Wave are more flexible and inventive, but they are crass mercenaries and likewise too pragmatic to appreciate the finer points of the air cult's philosophy. The Eternal Flame is the best of the lot, since the fire cultists share the decisiveness and creative energy of the Howling Hatred cult, even if they are overly proud and aggressive.": "嚎叫之恨的邪教徒认为黑土邪教徒粗糙、粗鲁、缺乏想象力，而且顽固到愚蠢的地步。最令人反感的是，大地崇拜者对嚎叫之恨邪教及其成就直言不讳地不以为然。碎浪的追随者更灵活、更有创造力，但他们是粗俗的雇佣兵，同样也太务实，无法欣赏空气邪教哲学的精髓。永恒之火是其中的佼佼者，因为火崇拜者分享了嚎叫之恨邪教的果断和创造能量，尽管他们过于骄傲和好斗。",

	"Throughout the adventure, each encounter presents monster names in bold. This is a visual cue pointing you to look up the monster's stat block.

	"The rise of Elemental Evil in Faerûn begins in the Dessarin Valley, a lightly settled region of caravan towns, isolated homesteads, and uninhabited wilderness just a week's journey from Waterdeep. Nothing of note to the wider world has happened here for hundreds of years. The frontier long ago receded farther northward, leaving behind a quiet backwater littered with ruins. These days, the Dessarin Valley has little in common with the popular conception of the Savage Frontier. Winters are hard here, but the hordes of orcs and other hungry monsters are a long way off from these parts.": "元素之恶在法鲁恩的兴起始于德萨林谷，这是一个由商队城镇、孤立的家园和无人居住的荒野组成的轻度定居地区，距离沃特德普只有一周的路程。几百年来，这里没有发生过任何值得注意的事情。边境早已向北退去，留下了一片安静的落后地区，到处都是废墟。如今，德萨林谷与流行概念中的野蛮边境没有什么共同之处。这里的冬天很艰苦，但成群的兽人和其他饥饿的怪物离这些地方很远。",
	"If the Dessarin Valley isn't quite as wild and lawless as it once was, it's still lightly settled territory that serves as a route to distant lands. Residents in places such as Red Larch or Triboar boast that their humble settlements are \"the Gateway to the North.\" Through these lands pass hundreds of caravans and keelboats each year, linking the great ports of Waterdeep and Neverwinter with places such as Everlund, Mirabar, or Silverymoon. The steady caravan traffic breathes life into the towns of this area, supporting businesses in the settlements along the Long Road. Inns cater to travelers anxious to sleep safely within sturdy walls and enjoy good food by a warm fire instead of camping by the side of the road.": "如果说德萨林谷不像以前那样野蛮和无法无天，它仍然是轻度定居的领土，是通往远方的通道。红落叶松或特里波尔等地的居民吹嘘说，他们简陋的定居点是 \"通往北方的门户\"。每年有数以百计的商队和龙骨船通过这些土地，将水底城和永夜城的大港口与埃弗隆德、米拉巴尔或银月城等地连接起来。稳定的商队交通为这一地区的城镇注入了活力，支持了长路沿线定居点的商业。旅店迎合了那些急于在坚固的墙内安全入睡的旅行者，在温暖的火堆旁享受美食，而不是在路边露营。",
	"In addition to catering to caravans and travelers heading to or from the far North, the Dessarin Valley is a breadbasket for the hungry populations of Waterdeep and Neverwinter. The farms and pastures of the area produce grain, livestock, poultry, apples, and hops, then ship them downriver (or drive them down the Long Road) to the coast. Few people become rich from farming, but farmers in the region do well for themselves provided the weather cooperates. (That's one reason why the unusual weather lately has been a concern.)": "除了满足前往或来自遥远的北方的商队和旅行者的需求外，德萨林谷还是沃特德普和永冬的饥饿人口的粮仓。该地区的农场和牧场生产谷物、牲畜、家禽、苹果和啤酒花，然后将它们顺流而下（或沿长路行驶）运往海岸。很少有人靠种地致富，但只要天气好，该地区的农民就能过上好日子。(这就是为什么最近的异常天气令人担忧的原因之一）。",
	"Most people who live in the Dessarin Valley have no idea of its long history. Old-timers nodding sagely by the hearths of the local taprooms sometimes observe, \"These lands, they have old bones.\" Most locals have no idea of how right they are.": "生活在德萨林谷的大多数人都不知道它的悠久历史。在当地自来水厂的壁炉旁，老一辈人不时地点头称是：\"这些土地，他们有古老的骨头\"。大多数当地人不知道他们是多么正确。",
	"While some truly ancient ruins in this area go back to the days of the first great elf kingdoms, none of these figure into the story of this adventure. The earliest realm that does is the shield dwarf kingdom of Besilmer, which was founded nearly six thousand years ago in −4420 DR. Its existence is so far back in the mists of history that only a handful of non-dwarf sages have even heard of it. Most people of the Dessarin Valley don't know Besilmer at all, but they are familiar with two of its works: the engineering marvel known as the Stone Bridge (described later in this chapter) and the crumbling ruins known as the Halls of the Hunting Axe.": "虽然这个地区的一些真正的古代遗迹可以追溯到第一个伟大的精灵王国的时代，但这些都没有出现在这次冒险的故事中。最早的王国是贝西尔默（Besilmer）的盾牌矮人王国，它建立于-4420 DR的近六千年前。它的存在在历史的迷雾中是如此遥远，以至于只有少数非矮人的圣人听说过它。德萨林谷的大多数人根本不知道贝西尔默，但他们熟悉它的两个作品：被称为石桥的工程奇迹（在本章后面描述）和被称为猎斧大厅的破败废墟。",
	"The realm of Besilmer was something rare: a dwarven kingdom built on the surface, with its strength measured in fields and pastures. It prospered for a time but was plagued by trolls and giants. The dwarves were obliged to build a stronghold underground, carving out the fortress-city of Tyar-Besil a century after Besilmer's founding. Unfortunately for the dwarves, the realm collapsed after its king and founder died in battle. Most of the surviving dwarves sought safer lands. The dwarven city beneath the Sumber Hills was abandoned by −4160 DR and then forgotten.": "贝西尔默王国是一个罕见的东西：一个建立在地表的矮人王国，它的力量以田地和牧场来衡量。它繁荣了一段时间，但却受到巨魔和巨人的困扰。矮人不得不在地下建造一个据点，在贝西尔默建立一个世纪后，建造了泰尔-贝西尔堡垒城市。对矮人来说，不幸的是，在其国王和创始人战死后，这个王国就崩溃了。大多数幸存的矮人寻求更安全的土地。桑伯山下的矮人城市在-4160 DR时被遗弃，然后被遗忘。",
	"Tyar-Besil slumbered in darkness for many long centuries, occasionally discovered and occupied by monsters or ambitious miners, only to be abandoned again. It came to light again in 893 DR, when a group of adventurers who called themselves the Knights of the Silver Horn discovered the ruins. Over the next six years they returned again and again, eventually founding strongholds of their own to safeguard the hidden entrances to the sprawling dungeon.": "Tyar-Besil在黑暗中沉睡了许多个世纪，偶尔被怪物或野心勃勃的矿工发现并占领，然后又被遗弃。公元893年，一群自称银角骑士的冒险家发现了这片废墟，它再次出现在人们眼前。在接下来的六年里，他们一次又一次地返回，最终建立了自己的据点，以保护这个庞大的地下城的隐藏入口。",
	"The knights had some success in clearing small domains in the wild Sumber Hills, but only a few years later the powerful orc realm of Uruth Ukrypt arose nearby, and the Dessarin Valley became a battlefield. Trouble followed on trouble: the Orcfastings War, the First and Second Trollwars, and finally a series of vicious drow raids. By the year 942 DR, human settlements in the Dessarin Valley had been all but wiped out, and the Knights of the Silver Horn were no more. Their strongholds crumbled into ruin and became known in later years as the Haunted Keeps. Eventually, no one remembered who built them or why.": "骑士们在清理野生桑伯山的小块领地时取得了一些成功，但仅仅几年后，附近出现了强大的兽人王国乌鲁斯-乌克雷特，德萨林谷成为了战场。麻烦接踵而至：兽人战争、第一和第二次巨魔战争，最后是一系列邪恶的鸦人袭击。到公元942年，德萨林谷的人类定居点几乎被消灭了，银角骑士团也不复存在。他们的据点坍塌成了废墟，在后来被称为 \"闹鬼的堡垒\"。最终，没有人记得是谁建造了它们，也没有人记得为什么。",
	"The current wave of settlement in and around the Dessarin Valley began after 1000 DR, coinciding with Waterdeep's growth from a warlord's stronghold into a major city. The first small outposts that would grow into places such as Red Larch and Triboar were carved out of a wild and untamed land. People resettling the Dessarin Valley found the remains of \"kingdoms of old\" scattered here and there throughout the area.": "目前在德萨林谷及其周围的定居浪潮始于1000 DR之后，与沃特德普从一个军阀的据点成长为一个主要城市相吻合。第一批小的前哨站，后来发展成红松和特里波尔这样的地方，都是在一片荒芜的土地上开凿出来的。重新定居在德萨林谷的人们发现 \"古老的王国 \"的遗迹散落在整个地区。",
	"The people of the Forgotten Realms number the years by the Dalereckoning calendar, which is abbreviated \"DR.\" Years are also given names, which are drawn from the writings of a great seer from long ago. The adventure is set in 1491 DR, the Year of the Scarlet Witch.": "被遗忘国度的人们用达勒克宁历法对年份进行编号，缩写为 \"DR\"。年份也被赋予了名称，这些名称来自于很久以前一位伟大的预言家的著作。这场冒险的背景是1491年，即猩红女巫之年。",
	"Each month consists of three ten-day long weeks called tendays. People refer to tendays the way people in other worlds refer to weeks.": "每个月由三个为期十天的星期组成，称为tendays。人们用其他世界的人指称周的方式来指称 tendays。",
	"Minor issues are nothing unusual in the Dessarin Valley. Bands of savage humanoids from the Sword Mountains or the Evermoors occasionally raid here. Human barbarians known as the Uthgardt roam these lands, and the more aggressive tribes can be very dangerous. Bandits sometimes gather in the lonelier parts of the vale to waylay caravans traveling the Long Road or the Kheldell Path. Every now and then reckless or unlucky adventurers manage to stir up some ancient curse in the ruins scattered around the area. Constables of valley settlements are usually up to the task of restoring the peace.": "在德萨林谷，小问题并不罕见。一群来自剑山或常春藤的野蛮人偶尔会袭击这里。被称为 \"乌斯加特\"（Uthgardt）的人类野蛮人在这些土地上游荡，而那些更具侵略性的部落可能非常危险。强盗们有时会聚集在山谷中较孤独的地方，劫持在长路或克尔德尔路径上旅行的商队。时不时地，鲁莽或不幸运的冒险者会设法在散落在该地区的废墟中挑起一些古老的诅咒。山谷居民点的警员们通常都能完成恢复和平的任务。",
	"Six months ago, an insidious new threat began to grow in the area, unsuspected by the locals or any passing adventurers. Dreams and visions drew four elemental prophets, one by one, to the Fane of the Eye beneath the Sumber Hills. Each prophet began to gather like-minded followers. Strangers trickled into the Dessarin Valley in ones or twos. Some were already cultists of Elemental Evil, eager to build a place where they could openly practice their vile rites. Others were brutal thugs, power-hungry dabblers in forbidden magic, or fanatics lured by the call of evil. At first the cultists valued secrecy above all else, but as their numbers grew and they established their strongholds, they turned their attention to expanding their hold on the Dessarin Valley.": "六个月前，一个阴险的新威胁开始在该地区增长，当地人和任何过路的冒险者都没有察觉。梦境和幻觉吸引了四位元素先知，一个接一个地来到桑伯山下的眼之神殿。每个先知都开始收集志同道合的追随者。陌生人三三两两地涌入德萨林谷。有些人已经是邪恶元素的崇拜者，渴望建立一个他们可以公开进行卑鄙仪式的地方。其他人则是残忍的暴徒、渴望权力的禁忌魔法爱好者，或者被邪恶的召唤所吸引的狂热分子。起初，邪教分子把保密工作看得比什么都重要，但随着他们人数的增加和据点的建立，他们把注意力转向了扩大对德萨林谷的控制。",
	"The presence of so many malefactors has caused a spate of banditry, kidnappings, murders, and raids. The cultists have also upset the weather in the region. All of these occurrences continue to worsen over the course of the adventure until the characters locate and clean out the four elemental cults in the Temple of Elemental Evil.": "这么多恶棍的存在引起了一连串的强盗行为、绑架、谋杀和突袭。这些邪教分子还破坏了该地区的天气。在冒险过程中，所有这些事件都会继续恶化，直到人物找到并清除了元素邪恶神殿中的四个元素邪教。",
	"Red Larch has been an important stop on the Long Road for two centuries now. Named for a distinctive stand of red larch trees that were cut down when the hamlet was founded, Red Larch became a settlement in the first place thanks to a drinkable spring that fed a sizable pond ideal for watering horses, oxen, and pack mules.": "两个世纪以来，红落叶松一直是长征路上的一个重要站点。红落叶松因其独特的红落叶松树而得名，这些树在小村庄建立时被砍伐，红落叶松之所以成为一个定居点，首先是由于有一个可饮用的泉水，它为一个适合浇灌马匹、牛和骡子的可观的池塘提供水源。",
	"An east-west trail meets the Long Road at the pond, running west to the logging community of Kheldell and east to Bargewright Inn and eventually Secomber. Another trail leads to quarries in the Sumber Hills and to ruins of stone keeps long ago left to monsters and outlaws (the Haunted Keeps).": "一条东西向的小路在池塘边与长路相接，向西延伸到伐木社区克尔德尔，向东延伸到巴格莱特旅馆，最终延伸到塞康伯。另一条小路通向桑伯山的采石场和很久以前留给怪物和逃犯的石堡遗址（闹鬼的堡垒）。",
	"In recent years, new quarries have been opened on the northwestern edge of town. So far these have yielded up great slabs of marble much prized in Waterdeep for facing large new buildings and repairing older edifices. Red Larch is also a center for stonecutters quarrying slate on the fringes of the Sumber Hills.": "近年来，新的采石场已经在城市的西北边缘开张了。到目前为止，这些采石场已经产出了大量的大理石板，在沃特迪普非常珍贵，可以用来建造大型的新建筑和修复旧建筑。红松也是石匠的中心，他们在桑伯山的边缘开采石板。",
	"While Red Larch remains prosperous, dark omens are appearing. The heart of the Sumber Hills has become far more dangerous, with monsters lurking seemingly everywhere (no one goes into the hills berry-picking or hare-hunting these days, though Red Larcher children traditionally did so daily in summer and fall). Banditry is on the rise, and the weather seems to be getting more severe and more unpredictable. Several Red Larcher shepherds have seen strange figures watching them from distant hillsides in the wild fields east of town where they have traditionally grazed their flocks. Quarry workers used to cut by torchlight when orders were backing up but do so no longer, shunning the pits by night. They are spooked by rumors of dark-robed figures in stone masks lurking in the darkness beyond the torchlight. The townsfolk fear that dangerous times are at hand, but no one seems to know what to do about it.": "虽然红洛奇仍然很繁荣，但黑暗的预兆正在出现。桑伯山的中心地带变得更加危险，似乎到处都潜伏着怪物（现在没有人去山上采摘浆果或狩猎野兔了，尽管红落叶山的孩子们在夏秋两季传统上每天都这样做）。土匪活动在增加，天气似乎变得更加恶劣，更加不可预测。有几个红军牧民看到奇怪的身影，在镇子东边的野地里从远处的山坡上看着他们，他们传统上在那里放牧。采石场工人曾经在订单增加时用手电筒切割，但现在不再这样做了，他们在夜间避开矿坑。他们被火炬之外的黑暗中潜伏着的戴着石头面具的黑袍人的传言吓坏了。镇民们担心危险的时刻即将来临，但似乎没有人知道该怎么做。",
	"To the average citizen of Waterdeep, Red Larch is known only for crumblecake, a local specialty. This much-maligned but hearty food is useful on the trail: baked loaves of turkey and wildfowl scraps, nuts, and chopped roots and greens, mixed in a chickpea mash. It is bland at the best of times, but badly made crumblecake tastes terrible.": "对于沃特迪普的普通公民来说，红松只因当地的特产--碎石饼而闻名。这种饱受诟病但却很丰盛的食物在路上很有用：由火鸡和野禽下脚料、坚果、切碎的根茎和绿色植物烤成的面包，混在鹰嘴豆泥中。在最好的情况下，它是平淡无奇的，但做得不好的碎肉饼味道就很糟糕。",
	"The inhabitants of Red Larch have become so frightened by the recent \"dark doings\" that rather than showing typical frontier reticence, they helpfully babble about everything they've seen and heard. Most hope to convince adventurers to investigate and put an end to the current troubles.": "红落叶松的居民已经被最近的 \"黑暗行动 \"吓坏了，他们没有表现出典型的边疆沉默，而是帮助地讲述他们所看到和听到的一切。大多数人希望能说服冒险者进行调查，结束目前的麻烦。",

	"A dozen of the Red Larch town elders have a secret: They belong to a secret society that calls itself \"the Believers.\" It isn't quite a cult, although it has special ceremonies and rites passed down for generations. It isn't quite a civic organization, despite the fact that some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in Red Larch are members. The members of the Believers use their secret association to guide town affairs, plot against business competitors, and sometimes take care of people who cause problems when it becomes clear that \"something must be done\" for the good of the town.": "红松镇的十几位长者有一个秘密：他们属于一个自称为 \"信徒 \"的秘密社团。它并不完全是一个邪教，尽管它有世代相传的特殊仪式和典礼。它也不完全是一个民间组织，尽管事实上红落叶山的一些最富有和最有权势的人都是成员。信徒会的成员利用他们的秘密协会来指导镇上的事务，策划反对商业竞争者，有时为了镇上的利益，在明确 \"必须做些什么 \"的情况下，也会解决那些造成问题的人。",
	"The Believers formed years ago when local miners discovered a secret underground chamber beneath the town. Strange things happened in the chamber, such as heavy stones levitating and moving about when no one was around (this is described in chapter 6, in the \"{@area Tomb of Moving Stones|623|x}\" adventure). The miners began using the chamber to honor those who died in quarry accidents and to appease Beshaba, goddess of misfortune and accidents. The Believers gather secretly at the tomb once every nine nights to see if any stones have moved—and if any have, they covertly meet the next night to discuss what the movements mean, and what is to be done. They keep the tomb and its strange secret to themselves.": "多年前，当地的矿工在镇子下面发现了一个秘密的地下密室，于是信徒们就形成了。在这个密室里发生了一些奇怪的事情，比如当周围没有人的时候，沉重的石头会悬浮起来并移动（这在第六章的\"{@area Tomb of Moving Stones|623|x} \"冒险中有所描述）。矿工们开始用这个密室来纪念那些死于采石场事故的人，并安抚Beshaba，不幸和事故的女神。信徒们每隔九天晚上都会秘密聚集在坟墓前，看看是否有石头移动--如果有，他们会在第二天晚上秘密会面，讨论这些移动意味着什么，以及该怎么做。他们对坟墓和它的奇怪的秘密保持沉默。",

Inside are stretching racks, cutting tables with sharp knives and scraps of tanned hide, a back room of finished leather ready for sale, and six huge, open-topped vats containing various foul-smelling, caustic liquids used in tanning.": "这个前仓库散发着令人瞠目结舌、令人窒息的臭味，在这里的一箭之地，所有其他气味都被湮没了。里面有拉伸架、摆放着锋利刀具的切割台和晒好的皮料碎片、一间准备出售的成品皮革的密室，以及六个巨大的敞口大桶，里面装着用于制革的各种恶臭的腐蚀性液体。",
	"The proprietor is Ulhro Luruth (male Chondathan human {@creature commoner}). He can't smell a thing, thanks to years of working in tanneries. He and his five loyal, terse assistants live and work here.": "经营者是乌尔罗-鲁鲁斯（男性崇丹人（%0%））。由于多年来在制革厂工作，他什么都闻不到。他和他的五个忠诚的、简练的助手在这里生活和工作。",
	"Luruth is one of the Believers. He knows he's not supposed to talk with outsiders about the secret society, but he's not too bright and might assume that questioners know more than they do.": "路路通是信徒之一。他知道自己不应该与外人谈论这个秘密社团，但他不太聪明，可能会认为提问者比自己知道的更多。",
	"Four identical, well-built warehouses stand here in ground covered in raked gravel and cinders. The moment anyone sets foot past the sign that says \"Bethendur's Storage/Rent Space by tenday, month, or year,\" a tall, smiling man emerges to meet them. This is Aerego Bethendur (male Tethyrian human {@creature noble}). He is assisted by three burly clerks and porters, who are former mercenary thugs.": "四个相同的、建好的仓库矗立在这里，地面上铺满了耙过的碎石和煤渣。当任何人踏过写着 \"贝特恩德的仓库/按天、按月、按年出租空间 \"的牌子时，一个高大的、面带微笑的男人就出现在他们面前。这就是艾瑞戈-贝瑟杜尔（男性泰特里亚人（%0%））。他身边有三个魁梧的文员和搬运工，他们都是前雇佣兵的打手。",
	"Aerego asks no questions, so anything can be stored here.

If they contain dead bodies (rare, but it happens), Aerego burns them without a word to the constable or anyone else.": "艾瑞格不问问题，所以任何东西都可以存放在这里。储存的物品如果没有移动或冲出容器，就会被严格地搁置起来，尽管那些开始有死亡气息的箱子会被拿出来打开。如果箱子里有尸体（很少见，但会发生），Aerego会把它们烧掉，不会对警员或其他人说一句话。",
	"Aerego is a Believer, although his attendance is spotty and he is beginning to wonder what exactly the mysterious priest Larrakh (see \"{@adventure The Tomb of Moving Stones|PotA|5|Tomb of Moving Stones}\" in chapter 6) has in mind for Red Larch.": "艾瑞格是一名信徒，尽管他的出席率很低，而且他开始怀疑神秘的牧师拉雷克（见第六章中的\"{@adventure The Tomb of Moving Stones|PotA|5|Tomb of Moving Stones}\"）对红叶松到底有什么想法。",

	"On the other nine days of the tenday, only one Red Larcher is here, a half-orc named Grund. Grund (male half-orc {@creature thug}) is the village simpleton.

	"Grund is a happy, dim-witted sort. The other vendors all pilfer from his open pickling vats, and he cheerfully lets them.

	"Aside from the bewildering profusion of doors, barrels, rotting old furniture, and tools leaning against its outside walls, this building looks like a private home.

He's the only vendor in town selling blank books and parchment.": "恩德瑞斯-瓦利沃（男性，泰特里亚人（%0%））是一个退休的商队商人，出售新旧商品：家具、灯具、地毯、镜子、武器、盾牌、头盔，以及其他一些东西。几乎任何东西都可以在这里买到，埋藏在一堆其他的东西下面，瓦利弗的脑子里有一个很好的运行清单。他是镇上唯一出售空白书籍和羊皮纸的商贩。",

He is friendly toward the Harpers and shares all of what he sees and hears with any Harper who asks. He is a useful, loyal informant and contact, though he's not really cut out for any derring-do.": "恩德利斯是一个害羞的、乱跑的小人，他雇用了一小队当地的孩子。他听说了大部分的传言和怪物的踪迹，但不知道--也不想知道--到底发生了什么。然而，他认真地观察和倾听。他对哈珀人很友好，并将他所看到和听到的一切与任何询问的哈珀人分享。他是一个有用的、忠诚的线人和联络人，尽管他并不真正适合做任何危险的事情。",
	"If one or more characters seem interested in helping the town with its recent troubles, Endrith says, \"I don't know if it's relevant, but I overheard someone say that they saw a skull pinned to a tree with a black arrow, like some kind of dire warning or ill omen.

	"Endrith bought a strange old book from a passing merchant just a couple of days ago. The book is a beautifully illuminated manuscript written in Dwarvish. Endrith doesn't read Dwarvish, so he doesn't know what is in it; a character who can read the words can tell that it's a genealogical history of the dwarf clans of Mirabar. If asked how he got it, Endrith explains that he bought it from a peddler passing through town. The peddler told Endrith that he bought it from a shady keelboat skipper in Womford, who had somehow come by a dozen similar books. (If the characters investigate, this leads to the \"{@area Womford Rats|127|x}\" encounter in chapter 3.) Endrith is willing to sell the tome for 50 gp, although he lets a Harper have it for 25 gp.": "恩德利斯几天前刚从一个路过的商人那里买了一本奇怪的古书。这本书是一本用矮人语写的精美的照明手稿。恩德瑞斯不懂矮人语，所以他不知道里面写的是什么；能读懂字的人可以看出这是一本米拉巴尔矮人氏族的家谱。如果问他是如何得到它的，恩德瑞斯解释说，他是从一个路过城镇的小贩那里买的。小贩告诉恩德瑞斯，他是从沃姆福德的一个阴暗的龙骨船船长那里买的，他不知怎么搞到了一打类似的书。(如果人物进行调查，这将导致第三章中的\"{@area Womford Rats|127|x} \"遭遇。) 恩德瑞斯愿意以50戈比的价格出售这本巨著，不过他以25戈比的价格让一个哈珀人得到了它。",
	"If you run the \"{@area Tomb of Moving Stones|623|x}\" adventure in chapter 6, the exposure of the Believers leads to some big changes. Even if the Believers can avoid a murder investigation, the folk of Red Larch are scandalized to learn that many of their most respected fellow citizens were part of a secret cabal. This discovery launches a whirlwind of gossip, innuendo, and recrimination.": "如果你执行第六章的\"{@area Tomb of Moving Stones|623|x} \"冒险，信徒们的暴露导致了一些大的变化。即使信徒们能够避免谋杀案的调查，红落叶城的人们也会因为得知他们中许多最受尊敬的同胞是一个秘密集团的成员而感到羞愧。这一发现掀起了一场流言蜚语、影射和指责的旋风。",
	"The other citizens of Red Larch shun the Believers for the next several months, and the Believers turn against one another. Many retreat into seclusion. Leadership of Red Larch passes to Harburk, but he's too busy as constable. After a month, Jalessa Ornra becomes Red Larch's mayor. She's liked and known for common sense, so the townsfolk rally around her.": "在接下来的几个月里，红松镇的其他市民都避开了信徒，而信徒们则互相对立。许多人退缩到隐居中。红松镇的领导权传给了哈伯克，但他作为治安官太忙了。一个月后，贾丽萨-奥恩拉成为红松镇的镇长。她很受欢迎，以常识著称，所以镇民们都拥护她。",

	"At the beginning of the adventure, the player characters know they are up against a mysterious threat. Something isn't right in the Dessarin Valley. To find out what exactly threatens these lands, they must leave Red Larch and venture out into the wider vale. Much of the early action of the adventure involves visiting different sites in and around the valley, solving problems and digging up clues that can lead the party to the Haunted Keeps—and then on to their confrontation with the elemental cults and the discovery of the temple complex below the Sumber Hills.": "在冒险开始时，玩家角色知道他们正面临着一个神秘的威胁。在德萨林谷，有些事情是不对的。为了弄清到底是什么在威胁着这些土地，他们必须离开红落叶松，到更广阔的山谷中去冒险。冒险的早期行动大多涉及到访问山谷及其周围的不同地点，解决问题并挖掘线索，从而将他们引向闹鬼堡垒--然后是他们与元素邪教的对抗以及发现桑伯山下的神庙群。",
	"It can take a full tenday for a slow-moving group—say, a merchant caravan—to trudge from Red Larch to Triboar. The Dessarin River is an obstacle to any group without a boat, since no crossing can be found between Ironford and the Stone Bridge.": "一个行动缓慢的团队--比如说，一个商队--从红落叶到特里波尔，可能需要整整一个工作日。德萨林河对任何没有船的队伍来说都是一个障碍，因为在铁佛和石桥之间找不到渡口。",

Within spitting distance of the statue is the Stag-Horned Flagon, a cozy tavern.": "在小镇广场的一角，矗立着大沙兰，这是一匹很久以前在安菲勒饲养的著名战马的黑石雕像。这匹被恶作剧者阉割的马，经常被兴致勃勃的当地人涂上鲜艳的颜色。孩子们被允许向栖息在石像上的鸟儿投掷石块，以保持石像没有粪便。孩子们经常自己爬上马背，紧紧抓住高高的、倾斜的马鞍，挥舞着手臂，指挥着想象中的军队作战。在雕像的不远处是鹿角酒馆，一个舒适的酒馆。",
	"Great Shalarn is a popular place to leave cryptic messages, either tucked under the statue's hind hooves or slid between the sculpted curls of its tail.": "大沙拉恩是一个很受欢迎的地方，可以留下隐秘的信息，要么塞在雕像的后蹄下，要么滑落在雕像尾巴的雕刻卷曲之间。",

	"Bargewright Inn reeks of manure and filthy mud. It houses blacksmiths, dealers who buy and sell horses, mules, and oxen, wheelwrights, coopers, and wagonmakers. It has inns, stables, and warehouses, and two concentric rings of high protective walls with gates that are firmly closed and barred by night. (Individuals can pay stiff fees to be raised and lowered after sunset on rope-slung chairs, but nothing beyond what they can carry can pass.)": "巴格莱特旅馆散发着粪便和肮脏的泥土的味道。它容纳了铁匠、买卖马匹、骡子和牛的商人、车轮工、库珀和马车制造商。它有客栈、马厩和仓库，还有两道同心环形的高大防护墙，大门紧闭，晚上有栅栏。(个人可以支付高昂的费用，在日落后坐在绳索吊椅上升降，但超出他们所能携带的东西都不能通过）。",
	"Bargewright Inn fell under Zhentarim influence a few years ago. Any member or ally of that faction can find a discreet welcome (and few or low fees) within its walls. The Zhentarim spy on everyone, even each other (or as one merchant put it, \"especially each other\"). Bargewright Inn is ruled by a plutocracy of business owners, most of whom are in the pockets of the Zhentarim.

It's also home to a tanner, a smith, some horse dealers and trainers who keep extensive stables, and an inn: the venerable, popular, and several-times-expanded Watchful Knight. The inn was originally named for an inoperative helmed horror that stood in the common room, but the creature mysteriously vanished years ago. The innkeeper went missing shortly thereafter.": "贝利亚德是许多牧民的家，他们的牛群在周围的山上游荡，特别是在东部。村里有一口公共水井，还有一个池塘，可以把拴好的马或牛赶到水里洗澡，赶走苍蝇，并让它们喝水。这里还有一个皮匠、一个铁匠、一些马贩子和驯马师，他们拥有大量的马厩，以及一家客栈：古老的、受欢迎的、几经扩建的守望骑士。这家旅店最初是以矗立在公共房间里的一个无法使用的头盔恐怖物命名的，但这个生物在几年前神秘地消失了。此后不久，旅馆老板也失踪了。",
	"In recent years, bodyguards and mercenaries formerly active in Waterdeep and along the Heartlands trade routes retired to Beliard, and their presence makes nearby brigands reluctant to raid the village directly.

Hired adventurers patrol the walls and the land immediately around them, watching for anyone approaching. More than five thousand people live and work in Goldenfields year round, farming more than twenty square miles of tillage in gangs of hard-working gardeners.": "现在由Ellardin Darovik修道院院长（男性泰特里亚人（%0%））管理，Goldenfields是翡翠飞地的一个据点。该派系的成员在这里和Chauntea的神职人员一样受到欢迎；他们中的许多人每次都会呆上几个月，帮助工作，并警惕地保卫农场，防止昆虫和瘟疫，以及可能的破坏者和掠夺者。雇佣的冒险者在城墙和周围的土地上巡逻，监视任何接近的人。超过五千人常年生活和工作在Goldenfields，在辛勤工作的园丁团伙中耕种超过二十平方英里的耕地。",

	"These monster-haunted ruins were once a grand and important city in the shield dwarf kingdom of Besilmer. The old city was a small forest of stone roundhouses, interlaced with gardens and joined by walls into one vast and sprawling building. It was surrounded by a moat fed by underground springs; splendid stone statues of heroic dwarves stood on high pedestals wherever one turned. All trace of the gigantic building is gone now except the foundations of its thickest, highest walls, which jut like lines of stone teeth from thickets of trees and creeping vines. For centuries, shards from magnificent windows of stained glass that once adorned the Halls have found their way into beautiful and distinctive glass bottles blown locally.": "这些被怪物困扰的废墟曾经是盾牌矮人王国贝西尔默的一座宏伟而重要的城市。旧城是一片由石头圆房组成的小森林，与花园交错在一起，并由城墙连接成一个巨大而无垠的建筑。它被一条由地下泉水供给的护城河所包围；无论在哪里，英雄矮人的华丽石雕都站在高高的基座上。现在，除了最厚、最高的墙基之外，这座巨大建筑的所有痕迹都已消失，这些墙基就像一排排石牙，从树木和爬行的藤蔓丛中伸出来。几个世纪以来，曾经装饰过大厅的华丽的彩色玻璃窗的碎片，被发现在当地吹制出美丽而独特的玻璃瓶。",

Her favorite shape is a beautiful female drow. In this form, Nurvureem lures adventurers into the manor and stalks them. She sometimes poses as a drow captive of a dragon, desperate to avoid being eaten and willing to pay with her treasure to be rescued.

The hills are mostly uninhabited.": "如果拉蒙和队伍在一起，他解释说他在附近的谷地放羊，不到一个月前他经过这个地方。他上次来的时候并没有坟墓。他几天前才发现这些坟墓，他不知道谁可能被埋在这里--红落叶松的人都没有失踪，他也不知道还有谁在这条路上。这座山大多无人居住。",
	"If the characters excavate the graves, they find one male dwarf dressed in artisan robes (a smith from Mirabar), one female human warrior dressed in a black surcoat with a red axe (the symbol of Mirabar's army), one male human warrior dressed in a black cloak with strange stony armor (an earth cultist), and one male human in a white robe with black feathers at the shoulders (an air cultist). All died from arrow wounds or crushing blows, and the earth cultists who won the battle buried the fallen on both sides because they believe everything should ultimately be consumed by the earth.": "如果人物挖掘坟墓，他们会发现一个身穿工匠长袍的男性矮人（米拉巴尔的铁匠），一个身穿黑色袈裟、手持红色斧头（米拉巴尔军队的标志）的女性人类战士，一个身穿黑色斗篷、身穿奇怪石质铠甲的男性人类战士（大地崇拜者），以及一个身穿白色长袍、肩部有黑色羽毛的男性人类（空气崇拜者）。所有的人都死于箭伤或粉碎性打击，赢得战斗的大地崇拜者埋葬了双方的死者，因为他们认为一切最终都应该被大地所吞噬。",

	"The most senior knight is a human woman of sixty years named Ushien Stormbanner, an ally of the Order of the Gauntlet. Ushien is happy to meet with any adventurers that turn up on her doorstep.

However, Jolliver Grimjaw felt that he didn't have sufficient numbers to hold Rivergard against a determined attack, so he employs three {@creature Bugbear||bugbears} to augment the garrison.

The two reavers with her roll their eyes and look bored, but Drosnin keeps going and going, brooking no interruptions. Once Drosnin begins, she drones on for two hours before dismissing the party. If they attempt to leave before she finishes her sermon, or if they interrupt her frequently, she orders the reavers to keep them from leaving. She attacks if the characters ignore her commands.": "德罗斯宁认为，任何闯入她的礼拜堂的陌生人都是被指派给她进行灌输的。德罗斯宁最喜欢的技巧是热情、无情的演说。只要人物不攻击，她就开始详尽的布道，讲述 \"深海的真理 \"和即将到来的 \"伟大启示\"。和她在一起的两个叛徒翻着白眼，显得很无聊，但德罗斯宁一直在说，一直在说，不允许别人打断。一旦Drosnin开始，她就会在解散聚会前叨叨两小时。如果他们试图在她完成布道之前离开，或者如果他们经常打断她，她会命令食人魔阻止他们离开。如果人物无视她的命令，她就会攻击。",

	"The defenders in the kennel (area H3) join the battle. The guards on the scaffolding (area H4) react slowly to disturbances in the courtyard, because some such occurrences are the fire cult feeding the wicker giant.

A small platform has been built outside this opening, and on it are supplies for repairing the roof, including 200 feet of hempen rope and a climbing kit.": "梯子通向约5英尺高的一个约3英尺宽的圆形开口。在这个开口外建了一个小平台，上面放着修理屋顶的用品，包括200英尺的麻绳和一个攀登工具。",

	"In chapter 3, the characters succeeded in exposing some or all of the elemental cults' surface outposts as nests of villainy. However, the Haunted Keeps represent only the tip of the iceberg. Each cult's base of operations lies hidden deep beneath the Sumber Hills in the ancient dwarven redoubt of Tyar-Besil. Clearing the cultists out of the Haunted Keeps deals a sharp setback to the affected cults, but unless the characters follow up on their initial successes by infiltrating the temple complex, the cults recover quickly from their early defeats and return in greater force.": "在第三章中，角色们成功地揭露了部分或全部元素邪教的表面哨所是恶棍的巢穴。然而，\"鬼堡 \"只是冰山一角。每个邪教的行动基地都隐藏在桑伯山下的古老的矮人堡垒泰尔-贝西尔。将邪教分子从鬼堡中清除出来，对受影响的邪教来说是一个巨大的挫折，但除非人物在最初的成功基础上继续渗透到神庙群中，否则邪教很快就会从早期的失败中恢复过来，并以更大的力量返回。",
	"The characters might want to assault the four elemental temples as quickly as possible, but they also need to deal with the cults' continuing efforts to corrupt and terrorize the people of the Dessarin Valley. While the characters are busy smashing one temple, the other three cults can do great harm in the area. Between expeditions to Tyar-Besil, the characters would be well advised to continue the investigations they began in {@area chapter 3|112|x}.": "人物可能想尽快攻击四个元素神庙，但他们也需要应对邪教继续腐蚀和恐吓德萨林谷人民的努力。当角色们忙着砸毁一座神庙时，其他三个邪教组织可以在该地区造成巨大的伤害。在远征Tyar-Besil的间隙，人物最好继续他们在{@area chapter 3|112|x}开始的调查。",
	"Ultimately, the natural disasters, monster incursions, and upswing in raider activity represent symptoms of a common disease: the presence of the Temple of Elemental Evil. No matter which disasters and events the characters choose to respond to, the solution to the region's woes lies in the great dungeon below the Sumber Hills.": "归根结底，自然灾害、怪物入侵和突袭者活动的上升代表了一种共同疾病的症状：元素邪恶神殿的存在。无论人物选择应对哪种灾难和事件，解决该地区困境的办法都在桑伯山下的大地牢中。",
	"Early in this part of the adventure, one or more characters receive messages from their factions, asking for help with other dangers in the area.

	"The summons could be a verbal message entrusted to an NPC waiting in the characters' base town. A messenger might brave the wilds to find the characters at their campsite. Magic might be used, such as a {@spell sending} spell. Whether the party chooses to respond or continue on their current course is up to the players.": "召唤可以是一个口头信息，委托给一个在人物的基地城市等待的NPC。一个信使可能会冒着荒野的危险在他们的营地找到这些人物。也可以使用魔法，比如一个（%0%）的法术。队伍是选择回应还是继续他们目前的路线，由玩家决定。",
	"The characters have a problem in Red Larch: Justran Daehl, the cellarer (ale buyer) of the Helm at Highsun, is a spy for the Cult of the Crushing Wave. He's been reporting on the party's comings and goings since they arrived in the region. Justran doesn't sign his letters, but if the characters find one of his reports in Rivergard or in the Temple of the Crushing Wave, they might be able to figure out who he is by looking for the author.": "这些人物在红松镇有一个问题。贾斯兰-戴尔（Justran Daehl）是高森之盔的酒窖管理员（买酒的人），是碎浪教的间谍。自从他们到达该地区后，他就一直在报告该党的来往情况。贾斯特兰不在他的信上签名，但如果人物在里弗加德或碎浪神庙找到他的一份报告，他们也许可以通过寻找作者来弄清他是谁。",
	"Most townsfolk don't recognize the handwriting, but those who do regular business with Justran and the Helm at Highsun can identify his script. These include Kaylessa (proprietor of the Swinging Sword Inn), Marlandro Gaelkur (of Gaelkur's), and Aerego Bethendur (the warehouse owner). If the characters show the letter to any of these individuals, the NPC identifies the handwriting. If the players say \"we show the letter to everyone in town,\" Justran hears about it and flees town before the characters corner him.": "大多数镇民不认识他的笔迹，但那些经常与贾斯特兰和高森的舵手做生意的人可以识别他的字体。这些人包括凯莱萨（摇摆剑客栈的老板）、马兰罗-盖尔库尔（盖尔库尔的）和艾瑞戈-贝瑟杜尔（仓库老板）。如果角色把信给这些人中的任何一个看，NPC就会辨认笔迹。如果玩家说 \"我们把信给镇上的每个人看\"，贾斯特兰就会听到这个消息，并在角色们找到他之前逃离镇子。",
	"If confronted, Justran Daehl denies the charge vehemently. He claims that any letter the characters present as evidence is \"a clear forgery\" until he sees a chance to escape. The cult spy is equivalent to a {@creature bandit captain}. If the encounter takes place at the Helm and the characters don't make a strong case against him, five {@creature Commoner||commoners} (tavern regulars) come to his defense. They aren't cult servants, just bystanders mistaken about Justran and trying to help the cellarer who keeps them in drink.": "如果面对面，贾斯兰-达尔激烈地否认这一指控。他声称，任何人物作为证据提出的信件都是 \"明显的伪造品\"，直到他看到有机会逃跑。邪教的间谍相当于一个（%0%）。如果遭遇发生在海尔姆，而人物没有对他提出有力的证据，那么五个（1%）（酒馆常客）会来为他辩护。他们不是邪教的仆人，只是被旁观者误认为是贾斯特兰，想帮助让他们喝酒的酒窖老板。",
	"Justran might take it upon himself to eliminate the characters. When the characters gather for dinner one evening after they return to Red Larch, he arranges to serve them poisoned ale. This has the same effect as a {@item potion of poison}, but the characters have advantage on their saving throws because Justran has to dilute the poison among several flagons. (The dilution also makes the poison unlikely to be lethal; Justran is better at making ale than he is at making poison.)": "贾斯特兰可能会自作主张地消灭这些人物。当角色们回到红落叶松后的某天晚上聚餐时，他安排给他们提供有毒的麦酒。这和{@item potion of poison}的效果是一样的，但是由于贾斯特兰要把毒药稀释在几个酒壶里，所以人物在救赎时有优势。(稀释也使得毒药不太可能致命；贾斯特兰在制作麦酒方面比他在制作毒药方面更有优势）。",
	"A brief investigation reveals that the poisoned flagons came from the taproom of the Helm at Highsun, and Justran Daehl personally delivered and poured the ale.": "简短的调查显示，被毒死的旗子来自海尔姆的自来水房，贾斯特兰-代尔亲自交付并倒出了麦芽酒。",
	"If the characters capture Justran, he reveals after brief interrogation that he is a member of the Cult of the Crushing Wave. He knows that an underground stream at Rivergard Keep leads to \"the temple below,\" although he has never been to the Temple of the Crushing Wave. He also knows that Jolliver Grimjaw and his followers (see {@area chapter 3|18d|x}) are water cultists.": "如果角色们抓住了贾斯特兰，他在简短的审讯后会透露自己是碎浪教的成员。他知道里弗加德堡的一条地下水道通向 \"下面的神庙\"，尽管他从来没有去过碎浪神庙。他还知道乔里弗-格林杰夫和他的追随者（见{@area chapter 3|18d|x}）是水崇拜者。",
	"The characters probably begin this chapter around 6th level. Encourage the players to take on the challenges in this chapter in whatever order they wish—let their interests drive the story. If you want to pace the adventure, the Temple of Howling Hatred suits a 6th-level party; the Temple of the Crushing Wave is appropriate for a 7th-level party; the Temple of Black Earth is designed for an 8th-level group; and the Temple of Eternal Flame works best for a party of 9th-level characters. Each quarter of the dungeon cleared out by the characters should advance the party one level.": "角色们可能在6级左右开始这一章。鼓励玩家以他们希望的任何顺序接受本章的挑战--让他们的兴趣来推动故事的发展。如果你想把握冒险的节奏，嚎叫的仇恨神殿适合6级的队伍；破碎的波浪神殿适合7级的队伍；黑土神殿是为8级的队伍设计的；而永恒的火焰神殿最适合9级的角色队伍。角色们每清理出四分之一的地牢，就应该使队伍提升一个等级。",
	"The four elemental cults maintain their chief stronghold in the ancient dwarven citadel of Tyar-Besil beneath the Sumber Hills. Each cult controls a portion of the old dwarven redoubt and has its own sanctum dedicated specifically to the element worshiped. These four temples are described in this chapter.": "四个元素崇拜者在桑伯山下的古老矮人堡垒泰尔-贝西尔保持着他们的主要据点。每个邪教都控制着古老的矮人堡垒的一部分，并拥有自己的圣殿，专门用于崇拜的元素。本章将介绍这四个神庙。",
	"Several subterranean routes lead from buried Tyar-Besil to the surface. Knifepoint Gully near Feathergale Spire leads to the Temple of Howling Hatred. The Dark Stream flows under Rivergard Keep, leading to the Temple of the Crushing Wave. The Ancient Stair descends from Sacred Stone Monastery to the Temple of Black Earth. Finally, the Path of Frozen Fire leads from the cellars below Scarlet Moon Hall to the Temple of Eternal Flame. Each elemental cult controls one of these routes and therefore controls the quarter of Tyar-Besil that connects to the surface outpost.": "有几条地下路线从埋在地下的泰尔-贝西尔通向地面。费瑟盖尔尖塔附近的刀尖沟（Knifepoint Gully）通往嚎叫的仇恨神殿。黑暗溪流流经里弗加德堡（Rivergard Keep）下方，通向碎浪神庙。古老的阶梯从圣石修道院下到黑土神庙。最后，冰火之路从猩红之月大厅下面的地窖通向永恒之火神庙。每个元素邪教都控制着其中一条路线，因此也控制着泰尔-贝西尔与地面前哨连接的那一区。",
	"Characters who dress in cultist gear might have some success infiltrating the temples. Each cult's monstrous allies rarely challenge a group of cultists that proceeds with confidence. Human members of the cult have a good chance to spot impostors at close range, but fast-talking characters might be able to pass themselves off as new arrivals, bearers of important information, or potential allies against another cult. If the characters ask for a prophet or issue threats in the prophet's name, they gain advantage on ability checks they make to bluff or intimidate their way into a temple. Fooled cultists insist on leading the party to one of the cult's leaders. At least two cultists from any group the characters interact with serve as escorts.": "穿着邪教装备的角色可能会在潜入神庙方面取得一些成功。每个邪教的畸形盟友都很少挑战一群自信地进行的邪教人员。邪教的人类成员有很好的机会在近距离发现冒名顶替者，但快嘴的角色可能会把自己伪装成新来的人、重要信息的携带者或反对另一个邪教的潜在盟友。如果这些人物要求找先知或以先知的名义发出威胁，他们就会在虚张声势或恐吓进入寺庙的能力检查中获得优势。被愚弄的邪教人员坚持要把队伍引向该邪教的一个领袖。至少有两名来自与角色互动的任何团体的邪教人员担任护卫。",
	"The cultists learn and adapt as the characters attack their strongholds. The four temple dungeons described in this chapter each include a room where that cult's elemental prophet might be encountered. The first time the characters find their way to one these locations, the prophet is present, and the characters can engage their foe. After one prophet falls, the remaining three prophets retreat to lower levels, leaving their minions to defend the temple dungeons.": "当角色们攻击他们的据点时，邪教徒们会学习并适应。本章描述的四个神庙地牢都包括一个可能会遇到该教派元素先知的房间。当角色第一次找到这些地点时，先知就会出现，角色可以与敌人交战。在一位先知倒下后，其余三位先知会撤退到更低的楼层，留下他们的爪牙来保卫神庙地宫。",

	"It's dangerous to linger in a stronghold without defeating that dungeon's prophet. If the characters try to camp in any of the four temples while its elemental prophet is still alive, the prophet gathers reinforcements and sends them to attack the intruding party. The prophets can organize this strike even if they have retreated down to the Fane of the Eye or the elemental nodes—visions and whisperings from the Eye guide their actions. (However, there are a few specific areas called out within the temple levels where the characters might be able to rest without attracting attention.)": "在没有打败地牢的先知之前，在一个据点里逗留是很危险的。如果人物试图在四个寺庙中的任何一个扎营，而它的元素先知还活着，先知就会召集援军，并派他们去攻击入侵的队伍。预言家们可以组织这次攻击，即使他们已经撤退到了眼球之窗或元素节点--来自眼球的幻象和低语引导着他们的行动。(然而，在神庙层中有几个特定的区域，人物可能会在那里休息而不会引起注意）。",

(See the \"{@area Random Encounters|095|x}\" section in chapter 2.) To rest in safety, the characters must either hide their camp or return to a nearby settlement.": "同样地，在被清除的鬼堡中扎营也不安全。元素预言家们会知道人物的位置，并派人去骚扰他们。小股的邪教突袭者和雇佣兵在桑伯山游荡，所以命令这样的队伍在某个鬼堡里攻击角色是很简单的事情。(参见第二章中的\"（%0%）\"部分）。为了安全地休息，人物必须隐藏他们的营地或返回附近的定居点。",

They worked the natural stone of the cavern and carved barracks and other living quarters into the rock, connecting them via lamplit passageways. Though it was a fortress, some commerce and art was present, with a rudimentary bazaar and dwarven skalds filling the air with chanted verse.

The water loses its healing power if removed from the fountain.": "这个喷泉是通过一个精心设计的系统来供应的，该系统挖掘了C26区域的隐藏泉水。一个古老的祝福为喷泉提供了适度的治疗能力；任何喝了它的人都会获得短暂休息的好处，但受益于喷泉魔法的人在24小时内不能再这样做。如果从喷泉中取出，水就会失去其治疗能力。",
