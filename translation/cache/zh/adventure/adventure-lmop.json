	"More than five hundred years ago, clans of dwarves and gnomes made an agreement known as the Phandelver's Pact, by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. In addition to its mineral wealth, the mine contained great magical power. Human spellcasters allied themselves with the dwarves and gnomes to channel and bind that energy into a great forge (called the Forge of Spells), where magic items could be crafted. Times were good, and the nearby human town of Phandalin (pronounced fan-duh-lin) prospered as well. But then disaster struck when orcs swept through the North and laid waste to all in their path.": "五百多年前，矮人和地精的部族达成了一项被称为 \"潘德夫契约 \"的协议，根据该协议，他们将在一个被称为 \"波浪回声洞 \"的奇妙洞穴中分享一个丰富的矿场。除了矿产资源外，这个矿场还蕴含着巨大的魔法力量。人类施法者与矮人和地精结盟，将这种能量引导并结合到一个伟大的锻造厂（称为 \"法术锻造厂\"），在那里可以制作魔法物品。时代是美好的，附近的人类城镇Phandalin（发音为fan-duh-lin）也随之繁荣起来。但是，当兽人横扫北方，把所有的东西都毁掉的时候，灾难发生了。",
	"A powerful force of orcs reinforced by evil mercenary wizards attacked Wave Echo Cave to seize its riches and magic treasures.

	"For centuries, rumors of buried riches have attracted treasure seekers and opportunists to the area around Phandalin, but no one has ever succeeded in locating the lost mine.

	"In part 2, \"Phandalin,\" the characters arrive in Phandalin to find it terrorized by the Redbrands, a gang of miscreants led by a mysterious figure called Glasstaff. A number of interesting NPCs can also be found in Phandalin, laying the hooks for short adventures in part 3. The Redbrands try to run the characters out of town, so the characters return the favor and storm the Redbrand lair.

	"Part 3, \"The Spider's Web,\" provides the characters with several short adventures in the region around Phandalin as they search for more information about the Black Spider and the dwarves' lost mine. The clues the characters picked up in Phandalin can lead them to spy on a mysterious wizard at the ruins of Old Owl Well, seek the advice of a dangerous banshee, oust a band of orcs lurking at Wyvern Tor, and investigate the ruins of the town of Thundertree.": "第三部分，\"蜘蛛网\"，为人物提供了在范达林周围地区的几个简短的冒险，因为他们要寻找更多关于黑蜘蛛和矮人丢失的矿场的信息。角色们在范达林捡到的线索可以引导他们在老猫头鹰井的废墟上窥探一个神秘的巫师，寻求一个危险的女妖的建议，赶走潜伏在怀恩托的一伙兽人，并调查雷树镇的废墟。",
	"Several of these leads point to Cragmaw Castle, which is the stronghold of King Grol, leader of the Cragmaw goblins. Here the characters discover that the Black Spider is a drow adventurer named Nezznar, and that the Cragmaw goblins work for him (drow are elves who hail from a realm deep underground). More importantly, they recover {@creature Gundren Rockseeker|LMoP}'s map to the lost mine, or learn the mine's location from one of the other leads they unearth during part 3.": "其中有几条线索指向克拉格玛城堡，它是克拉格玛妖精的首领格罗尔国王的据点。在这里，角色们发现黑蜘蛛是一个名叫Nezznar的乌鸦冒险家，而克拉格马夫地精为他工作（乌鸦是来自地下深处的精灵）。更重要的是，他们找到了{@creature Gundren Rockseeker|LMoP}通往失落矿井的地图，或者从第三部分中发现的其他线索中得知矿井的位置。",

	"Each of the characters included in this set has two personality traits (one positive and one negative), an ideal, a bond, and a flaw. These elements can make the character easier and more fun to roleplay. Personality traits provide a glimpse into the character's likes, dislikes, accomplishments, fears, attitude, or mannerisms. An ideal is something that the character believes in or strives for above all else. A character's bond represents a connection to a person, place, or event in the world-someone the character cares about, a place the holds a special connection, or a treasured possession. A flaw is a characteristic that someone else can exploit to bring the character to ruin or cause the character to act against his or her best interests.": "这套书中的每个人物都有两个性格特征（一个是正面的，一个是负面的），一个理想，一个纽带和一个缺陷。这些要素可以使角色更容易、更有趣地进行角色扮演。个性特征提供了对该角色的喜欢、不喜欢、成就、恐惧、态度或举止的一瞥。理想是指人物所相信的或为之奋斗的东西，高于其他一切。人物的纽带代表着与世界上某个人、某个地方或某个事件的联系--人物所关心的某个人、与之有特殊联系的某个地方、或某个珍贵的财产。缺陷是指别人可以利用的特性，使人物走向毁灭或使人物的行为违背他或她的最佳利益。",
	"When a player roleplays a negative personality trait or gives in to the drawbacks presented by a bond or flaw, you can give that player one inspiration as a reward. A player with inspiration can use it in a situation where his or her character's personality traits, ideal, or bond relate to what's happening. Spending inspiration gives the character advantage on one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.": "当一个玩家扮演了一个消极的人格特征，或者屈服于纽带或缺陷所带来的弊端，你可以给这个玩家一个灵感作为奖励。拥有灵感的玩家可以在他或她的角色的个性特征、理想或纽带与正在发生的事情有关的情况下使用它。花费灵感可以使该角色在一次能力检查、攻击卷或蓄力上获得优势。",
	"A character can have only one inspiration at a time.": "一个角色在同一时间只能有一个灵感。",

It could be a swords-and-sorcery setting at the dawn of civilization, where barbarians battle evil sorcerers, or a post-apocalyptic fantasy where elves and dwarves wield magic amid the wreckage of a technological civilization. Most D&D settings are somewhere between those two extremes: worlds of medieval high fantasy with knights and castles, as well as elven cities, dwarven mines, and fearsome monsters.": "就像奇幻小说或电影一样，冒险的背景是一个更大的世界。事实上，这个世界可以是DM和玩家所能想象的任何东西。它可以是文明初期的剑与魔法背景，野蛮人与邪恶的巫师作战；也可以是末世的幻想，精灵和矮人在科技文明的残骸中挥舞魔法。大多数D&D设定介于这两个极端之间：有骑士和城堡的中世纪高级幻想世界，以及精灵城市、矮人矿场和可怕的怪物。",

Clerics in the service of gods wield mace and spell, questing against the terrifying powers that threaten the land.

	"On the roads and rivers of the Realms travel minstrels and peddlers, merchants and guards, soldiers, sailors, and steel-hearted adventurers carrying tales of strange, glorious, faraway places.

Thousands of restless would-be heroes from backcountry farmsteads and sleepy villages arrive in Neverwinter and the other great cities every year in search of wealth and renown.": "在王国的道路和河流上，游吟诗人和小贩、商人和卫兵、士兵、水手和铁石心肠的冒险家，带着陌生、光荣、遥远的地方的故事。好的地图和清晰的小路甚至可以把一个没有经验的青年带向世界的远方，实现他的荣耀梦想。每年都有数以千计来自乡间农庄和沉睡村庄的不安分的未来英雄来到永夜城和其他大城市，寻找财富和名声。",
	"Known roads may be well traveled, but they aren't necessarily safe. Fell magic, deadly monsters, and cruel local rulers are all perils that you face when you travel in the Forgotten Realms. Even farms and freeholds within a day's walk of a city can fall prey to monsters, and no place is safe from the sudden wrath of a dragon.": "已知的道路可能很好走，但它们不一定安全。堕落的魔法、致命的怪物和残酷的地方统治者都是你在被遗忘的领域中旅行时面临的危险。即使是离城市只有一天路程的农场和土地，也可能成为怪物的猎物，没有一个地方可以避免龙的突然发怒。",
	"The regional map shows just a tiny part of this vast world, in a region called the Sword Coast. This is a region of adventure, where daring souls delve into the wreckage of ancient strongholds and explore ruins of long-lost cultures.

	"Exterior walls and load-bearing interior walls are 5 feet thick, with 3 feet of mortared fill sandwiched between 1-foot-thick courses of hard stone blocks. Interior walls are 1-foot-thick worked stone.": "外墙和承重内墙的厚度为5英尺，在1英尺厚的硬石块之间夹着3英尺的变形填料。内墙是1英尺厚的加工石块。",
	"Arrow slits in the castle walls are 10 feet above the outside ground level, 4 feet above the interior floor level, 8 inches wide, and 4 feet high. A creature on one side of an arrow slit gains three-quarters cover against attacks from the other side (see \"Cover\" in the rulebook).": "城堡墙壁上的箭缝高于外部地面10英尺，高于内部地板4英尺，宽8英寸，高4英尺。在箭缝一侧的生物可以获得四分之三的掩护，以抵御来自另一侧的攻击（见规则手册中的 \"掩护\"）。",
	"The main gates between areas 1 and 2 are made of bronze-covered wood, but they are corroded and collapsed.": "1区和2区之间的主门是由青铜包覆的木头制成的，但它们已被腐蚀并倒塌。",
	"The castle consists of seven crumbling towers of different sizes and heights, but the upper stories are all in varying states of collapse. A short flight of steps leads up to a terrace in front of the main entryway. Past the wreckage of a pair of sundered doors lies a shadowed hall. Round towers loom over the entranceway, with dark arrow slits looking down on the terrace.": "城堡由七个大小不一、高低不等的破败塔楼组成，但上面的楼层都处于不同的坍塌状态。一段短小的台阶通向主入口前的一个平台。穿过一对被拆毁的门的残骸，是一个阴影下的大厅。圆形的塔楼在入口处若隐若现，从黑暗的箭缝中向露台望去。",
	"No monsters dwell here, but the goblin sentries in {@area 3|119} are supposed to be keeping watch. They glance only occasionally out of the arrow slits, however, so characters who move quietly might be able to creep past them. Have each character make a Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check. The lowest check is the DC for the goblins' Wisdom checks to notice the party.": "这里没有怪物居住，但{@area 3|119}的地精哨兵应该是在放哨。不过，他们只是偶尔从箭缝中看一眼，所以行动安静的人物也许能悄悄地走过去。让每个角色做一个灵巧（（%1%））的检查。最低的检定是地精的智慧检定的DC，以便注意到队伍。",
	"If the goblins spot the characters (or if the characters approach openly), the goblins shoot arrows from behind the arrow slits. However, they can't fire directly at enemies at or past the broken gate. The goblins also shout loudly enough to alert their comrades in areas 4 and 6 that the castle is under attack.": "如果地精发现了角色（或角色公开接近），地精就会从箭缝后面射出箭。但是，他们不能直接向破门处或过去的敌人射击。妖精们还会大声喊叫，以提醒他们在4号和6号区域的战友们，城堡正在受到攻击。",
	"Rather than storm Cragmaw Castle with weapons in hand, clever characters might try to talk their way inside. For example, they might don the scarlet cloaks of the Redbrands and claim to be emissaries sent by Iarno \"Glasstaff\" Albrek, the Redbrand leader, to meet with King Grol. A good DM rewards this kind of clever thinking by giving the characters a chance to succeed.": "与其拿着武器冲进克拉格莫城堡，聪明的角色可能会尝试通过谈话进入城堡。例如，他们可以穿上红袍人的猩红斗篷，声称自己是红袍人领袖Iarno \"Glasstaff\" Albrek派来的特使，要与Grol国王会面。一个好的DM会通过给角色一个成功的机会来奖励这种聪明的想法。",
	"It's okay if the characters circumvent combat and talk their way past castle defenders. Both the Cragmaw tribe and the Redbrands work for the Black Spider, so the goblinoids aren't likely to attack the party if they claim to be working in the Black Spider's interest.": "如果角色们绕过战斗，以谈话的方式越过城堡守卫者，那也是可以的。克拉格玛部落和红袍人都为黑蜘蛛工作，所以如果妖精们声称为黑蜘蛛的利益工作，他们就不可能攻击党。"
