	"The legendary inventor Kwalish disappeared eons ago... as it turns out, finding a crashed planar ship and studying its technology to fuel his own experiments. Only now, Kwalish's lost research is desperately needed! Will you dare an alternate expedition into the Barrier Peaks to find him?": "传说中的发明家Kwalish在几个世纪前就消失了......事实证明，他找到了一艘坠毁的星球飞船，并研究其技术以推动自己的实验。只是现在，Kwalish遗失的研究被急切地需要！你是否敢于另辟蹊径，进入壁垒探险？你是否敢于另辟蹊径，进入壁垒峰寻找他？",
	"As a special offering in support of Extra Life 2018, we're pleased to present the following adventure scenario, built around a new expedition to the legendary Barrier Peaks. This adventure is suitable for characters of 5th to 10th level.": "作为支持《额外生活》2018年的特别奉献，我们很高兴地介绍以下冒险场景，它是围绕着对传奇的屏障峰的新探险而建立的。这个冒险适用于5到10级的角色。",
	"In centuries long past, a common scholar named Kwalish took an unlikely path to becoming one of the most powerful arcane inventors of all time, after his discovery of strange magic in the Barrier Peaks. His studies of an ancient, crashed planar craft set him on a path that might have seen him rival Ioun and Heward—until his experiments overtook him, and he became lost to the ages. All that's left of his legacy is a single example of his earliest work—the {@item Apparatus of Kwalish} that is the only way most folk now know his name.": "在很久以前的几个世纪里，一个名叫Kwalish的普通学者在屏障之峰发现了奇怪的魔法之后，走上了一条不可能的道路，成为有史以来最强大的奥术发明家之一。他对一个古老的、坠毁的平面飞行器的研究使他走上了一条可能与伊昂和休沃德相抗衡的道路--直到他的实验超越了他，而他也迷失在了岁月中。他的遗产只剩下他最早的作品的一个例子--{@item Apparatus of Kwalish}，这是大多数人现在知道他名字的唯一途径。",
	"It was Kwalish's foray into the Barrier Peaks that set his advanced studies into motion, when he joined an ill-fated expedition in search of Daoine Gloine, a legendary city said to be populated by creatures of glass. Though the rest of his party perished along the way, Kwalish stumbled upon a wrecked planar craft of unknown providence and spent years exploring its secrets. He even repurposed much of the craft's unique magical technology into his first laboratory, building planar gates of his own design.": "夸里什进入壁垒峰，开始了他的高级研究，当时他加入了一个命运多舛的探险队，寻找Daoine Gloine，一个传说中由玻璃生物居住的城市。虽然他的队伍中的其他人在途中丧生，但夸里什偶然发现了一艘残破的平面飞船，并花了数年时间探索其秘密。他甚至将这艘飞船的大部分独特的魔法技术重新用于他的第一个实验室，建造他自己设计的平面门。",
	"Testing one such gate as it forged a connection to the Nine Hells attracted the attention of a bone devil. Trailing Kwalish back across the planes, the devil took over the inventor's laboratory for itself. Kwalish managed to escape but left much of his lore behind, while the bone devil spent the years that followed converting the place into a dark monastery—and establishing its own cult.": "测试一个这样的门，因为它与九层地狱建立了联系，吸引了一个骨魔的注意。追踪Kwalish回到各个星球，骨魔为自己占领了这位发明家的实验室。夸里什成功逃脱，但留下了他的大部分理论，而骨魔则在随后的几年里将这里改造成了一个黑暗的修道院，并建立了自己的邪教。",
	"After much wandering in the mountains, Kwalish relocated to an equally remote location—Daoine Gloine, the mysterious city his expedition had originally sought. The site's isolation made it a suitable place for him to continue his research. However, its populace turned out not to be creatures of glass as the legends suggested, but clans of kenku that worshipped a medusa with the unique ability to transform her victims into glass.": "在山里徘徊了很久之后，夸里什搬到了一个同样偏远的地方--道恩-格洛因，那是他的探险队最初寻找的神秘城市。这个地方与世隔绝，是一个适合他继续研究的地方。然而，这里的居民并不像传说中的那样是玻璃生物，而是崇拜一个具有将受害者变成玻璃的独特能力的美杜莎的肯库部族。",
	"Before Kwalish could be made to suffer the same fate at the hands of the chaotic kenku and their mad medusa, he once more opened a planar gate, this time to the 222nd layer of the Abyss—Juiblex's Slime Pits, from which he summoned forth a horrific plague of ooze to clear out the city and help him defend his new lab.": "在夸里什被混乱的肯库和他们疯狂的美杜莎弄得遭受同样的命运之前，他再次打开了一道平面门，这次是通往深渊的第222层--吉布利克斯的粘液坑，他从那里召唤出了可怕的粘液瘟疫来清除城市，帮助他保卫他的新实验室。",
	"Kwalish cut off all access to Daoine Gloine, and the city was lost to the ages. The legendary inventor has not been heard from since. Only now, the characters are in dire need of his aid...": "夸里什切断了所有通往道恩-格洛因的通道，而这座城市也消失在岁月中。从此，这位传奇的发明家就没有了消息。只是现在，这些人物急需他的帮助......",
	"In 2017, the D&D team added several projects to the DMs Guild in support of Extra Life (including One Grung Above, The Lost Kenku, and The Tortle Package). The funds raised from the sale of these packages went to this extremely worthy cause—and for 2018, you'll find even more projects made available on the DMs Guild throughout the year. As part of these efforts, it's our privilege to contribute the following adventure to the cause. We wanted to provide as much value for your donation as we could, providing new maps, monsters, and magic items—and of course, the scenario itself, accompanied by a range of notes and options to help cater to your preferred play style. We hope you enjoy Lost Laboratory of Kwalish. And you have our sincere thanks for your support of Extra Life and Children's Miracle Network Hospitals.": "2017年，D&D团队在DMs公会中增加了几个项目以支持Extra Life（包括One Grung Above、The Lost Kenku和The Tortle Package）。出售这些套餐所筹集的资金用于这一极其有意义的事业--而在2018年，你会发现全年在DMs公会上有更多的项目。作为这些努力的一部分，我们很荣幸地将以下冒险活动贡献给这项事业。我们希望为您的捐赠提供尽可能多的价值，提供新的地图、怪物和魔法物品--当然还有剧情本身，伴随着一系列的注释和选项，以帮助迎合您喜欢的游戏风格。我们希望你能喜欢《失落的Kwalish实验室》。我们衷心感谢您对《额外生命》和儿童奇迹网络医院的支持。",
	"The characters are charged with locating Kwalish's long-lost laboratory and the magical technology that might be found there. As they start their search, they're first directed to an accomplished gnome map merchant named Anaxi Zephries, known as \"the Cartophile.\" Information collected by Anaxi over the years has traced Kwalish's route into the Barrier Peaks—at least up to the point where his expedition was lost, despite its members' formidable knowledge and skill.": "这些人物负责寻找Kwalish失落已久的实验室和可能在那里发现的魔法技术。当他们开始搜索时，他们首先被引导到一个名叫Anaxi Zephries的有成就的地精地图商人那里，他被称为 \"制图者\"。Anaxi多年来收集的信息追踪了Kwalish进入屏障峰的路线--至少到他的探险队迷失的那一刻为止，尽管其成员拥有强大的知识和技能。",
	"Working their own way into the Barrier Peaks, the characters eventually arrive at Kwalish's first laboratory—the remains of a planar craft whose technology drove the inventor's early research. But they discover that Kwalish has long since been exiled, and his lab converted into a monastery now dedicated to the bone devil that is the site's Grand Master. The characters must negotiate their entrance into the monastery, and from there to its treasury. Hidden within the treasury are notes from Kwalish's original expedition that lead to Daoine Gloine, the legendary city deep within the Barrier Peaks—and the site of Kwalish's current laboratory.": "角色们通过自己的方式进入屏障峰，最终到达了Kwalish的第一个实验室--一个平面飞行器的遗迹，其技术推动了这位发明家的早期研究。但是他们发现Kwalish早就被流放了，他的实验室被改造成了一座修道院，现在供奉的是该地的大法师--骨魔。角色们必须通过谈判进入修道院，并从那里进入其库房。库房里藏着夸里什最初的探险笔记，这些笔记通往道恩-格洛因（Daoine Gloine），那是位于屏障之峰深处的传奇城市，也是夸里什目前的实验室所在地。",
	"After reaching Daoine Gloine, the characters find the city buried beneath a flood of gelatinous ooze, with only its tallest stone structures left rising above the surface. The characters must find a safe means of descent into the ooze as they seek the entrance to Kwalish's hidden laboratory—and avoid the empty city's deadly guardians. Once they reach the lab, the characters meet with the legendary inventor and can negotiate for the assistance necessary to complete their quest—and they might even have the chance to help Kwalish deal with one of a number of problems of his own.": "在到达Daoine Gloine之后，角色们发现这座城市被埋在胶状渗出物的洪流之下，只有最高的石头建筑耸立在表面。角色们必须找到一个安全的方法，让他们能够安全地下降到渗出物中，同时寻找Kwalish隐藏的实验室的入口--避免空城的致命守护者。一旦他们到达实验室，角色们就会见到这位传奇的发明家，并可以通过谈判获得完成任务所需的援助--他们甚至有机会帮助Kwalish处理他自己的一些问题。",
	"The original Expedition to the Barrier Peaks—1980's adventure module S3 for first edition AD&D—placed its titular mountains in Greyhawk, north of the Grand Duchy of Geoff and the Valley of the Mage. Depending on your campaign, you can set this adventure in any similar location: a mysterious mountain range that even dedicated explorers have failed to fully map. In the Forgotten Realms, one possible location for the adventure is Chult, the land explored in Tomb of Annihilation. The mysterious and poorly mapped peninsula contains several suitable mountain ranges, including the Mistcliffs and the Kobold Mountains. Elsewhere in Faerûn, the peaks surrounding Halruaa, a land known for its magical technology, are a good choice. Alternatively, campaigns making use of the {@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH} adventure might look for a location closer to the city, including the Greypeaks or the Nether Mountains.": "最初的《屏障之峰远征》--1980年第一版AD&D的冒险模块S3--将其名下的山脉放在格雷霍克，位于杰夫大公国和法师谷的北部。根据你的活动，你可以把这个冒险放在任何类似的地方：一个神秘的山脉，即使是专门的探险家也未能完全描绘出来。在被遗忘的领域，一个可能的冒险地点是楚尔特，即《毁灭之墓》中探索的土地。这个神秘且地图绘制不全的半岛上有几条合适的山脉，包括雾崖和哥布林山脉。在Faerûn的其他地方，以魔法技术著称的Halruaa周围的山峰也是一个不错的选择。另外，利用{@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH}冒险的活动可以寻找一个离城市更近的地方，包括Greypeaks或Nether山脉。",
	"To run this adventure, you need the D&D fifth edition core rulebooks ({@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, {@book Dungeon Master's  Guide|DMG}, and {@book Monster Manual|MM}).": "要运行这个冒险，你需要D&D第五版核心规则书（（%0%）、（%1%）和（%2%））。",

	"Most of the monsters that appear in this adventure are from the {@book Monster Manual|MM}, along with new creatures and NPCs, and monsters from {@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|VGM} and {@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}. For easy reference, all the stat blocks for the creatures in the adventure can be found in appendix C. When a creature's name appears in bold type, that's a visual cue pointing you to its stat block in that appendix.

	"This adventure features numerous encounters and challenges that should keep a group entertained for multiple sessions. However, you can easily run a shorter version of the adventure, or even an exciting one-shot, by making the following modifications:": "这个冒险的特点是有许多遭遇和挑战，应该能让一个小组在多个环节中保持娱乐。然而，你可以通过以下的修改，轻松地运行一个较短的冒险版本，甚至是一个令人兴奋的单次拍摄。",
	"Run the adventure as written, making use of both the monastery and the ooze-flooded city locations.": "按规定进行冒险，同时利用修道院和水灾城市的地点。",
	" Run the adventure as written, up to the monastery. Then forgo a second laboratory location, instead replacing the final brain in a jar in the treasury (area M10) with Kwalish, and conclude the adventure there": " 按规定进行冒险，一直到修道院。然后放弃第二个实验室的位置，而用库房（M10区）的罐子里的最后一个大脑替换掉Kwalish，并在那里结束冒险。",
	"Give your players an adventure hook, assign them a guide (see \"{@adventure Part 1: Mission to the Barrier Peaks|LLK|1}\"), and start them at {@area C1|032}, overlooking the bone devil's monastery. Then as above, replace the treasury's brain in a jar with Kwalish for an exciting conclusion.": "给你的玩家一个冒险的钩子，给他们分配一个向导（见\"{@adventure Part 1: Mission to the Barrier Peaks|LLK|1}\"），然后让他们在{@area C1|032}开始，俯瞰骨魔的修道院。然后如上所述，用Kwalish取代宝库里的大脑，以获得一个令人兴奋的结论。",
	"In the course of previous adventures, the characters might have come up against a special magical-mechanical dilemma too challenging to overcome. Perhaps a secret door in a dungeon complex has been built around an iron golem, or an array of dangerous clockwork devices discovered within a city defy any attempts to turn them off. All research into the problem suggests that the inventor Kwalish might have the solution—if only he hadn't gone missing years before.": "在以前的冒险过程中，人物可能会遇到一个特殊的魔法-机械困境，难以克服。也许地牢里的一扇秘密大门是围绕着一个铁制傀儡建造的，或者在一个城市里发现的一系列危险的发条装置无视任何试图将其关闭的尝试。对这个问题的所有研究表明，发明家Kwalish可能有解决方案--如果他没有在几年前失踪的话。",
	"Alternatively, you might consider any of the following hooks. Several involve a pending crisis, such that the players are seeking Kwalish not just on their own behalf, but to prevent hardship to friends, family, or the common folk. Just make sure that the peril doesn't come on too quickly, though, as an expedition into the Barrier Peaks will take some time.": "另外，你可以考虑以下任何一种钩子。其中有几个涉及到即将发生的危机，比如玩家不仅是为了自己的利益，也是为了防止朋友、家人或普通人陷入困境而寻找Kwalish。但要确保危险不会来得太快，因为对壁垒山峰的探险需要一些时间。",
	"If you're playing through or using events from {@adventure Tomb of Annihilation|ToA} in your campaign, the characters might hear rumors that Kwalish's laboratory holds lore that can help deactivate the Soulmonger. If the characters have any hope of surviving the tomb and ending the death curse, they must first make the dangerous journey to the inventor's lost lab.": "如果你在你的战役中通过或使用{@adventure Tomb of Annihilation|ToA}的事件，角色们可能会听到传言说Kwalish的实验室拥有可以帮助解除灵魂使者的传说。如果角色们有任何希望从坟墓中幸存下来并结束死亡诅咒，他们必须首先进行危险的旅程，前往发明家丢失的实验室。",
	"Alternatively, in the aftermath of a {@adventure Tomb of Annihilation|ToA} campaign, a friend, family member, or mentor important to the characters might have been placed in stasis within a magical sarcophagus to protect them from the death curse. With the curse lifted, this NPC can now be saved—except the sarcophagus cannot be opened by any magical or mundane means. After learning that the sarcophagus is one of Kwalish's designs, the characters must seek out his lost laboratory for the means to open it—or their friend will sleep for eternity.": "另外，在{@adventure Tomb of Annihilation|ToA}战役结束后，一个对角色很重要的朋友、家人或导师可能被放置在一个魔法石棺里，以保护他们不受死亡诅咒的影响。随着诅咒的解除，这个NPC现在可以被拯救了--但石棺不能用任何魔法或世俗的方法打开。在得知石棺是Kwalish的设计之一后，角色们必须寻找他丢失的实验室以获得打开石棺的方法，否则他们的朋友将永远沉睡。",
	"A number of hooks can connect to the exploits of characters engaged in a {@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH} campaign. The famed walking statues of Waterdeep are showing signs of getting ready to power up once more, and not even the Blackstaff can shut them down. Old histories suggest that Kwalish's lore might hold the secrets of doing so, and the characters are sent to seek that lore out before the great magical statues can run amok.": "一些钩子可以连接到参与{@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH}活动的角色的探索。水底世界著名的行走雕像有准备再次发力的迹象，甚至连黑杖都无法关闭它们。古老的历史表明，Kwalish的传说可能蕴含着这样做的秘密，人物被派去寻找这个传说，以免伟大的魔法雕像横行。",
	"Alternatively, the grand parade of the Day of Wonders turns to deadly chaos when one of its inventive mechanical floats goes berserk and unleashes destruction across the city. After stopping the threat, the characters learn that it was built based on a Kwalish design, and that other such designs might be used to build great engines of destruction. The secrets to overcoming such inventions can be found only in Kwalish's lab.": "另外，奇迹日的盛大游行变成了致命的混乱，因为其中一个创造性的机械花车发狂了，并在整个城市释放了破坏。在阻止了这一威胁后，角色们了解到它是根据Kwalish的设计建造的，而其他这样的设计可能被用来建造伟大的毁灭引擎。克服这种发明的秘密只能在Kwalish的实验室里找到。",
	"As a more integral part of a {@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH} campaign, characters who successfully discover the location of the Vault of Dragons might discover that the keys needed to access it are lost. Rumors speak of another means of opening the vault—a secret known only to the lost inventor.": "作为{@adventure Waterdeep: Dragon Heist|WDH}战役的一个重要组成部分，成功发现龙库位置的人物可能会发现，进入龙库所需的钥匙已经丢失。有传言说有另一种打开龙库的方法--只有失落的发明家才知道的秘密。",
	"If your campaign is set in the city world of Ravnica, as outlined in {@book Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica|GGR}, Kwalish might be a chemister from the Izzet League who left the guild to pursue his own work away from Niv-Mizzetr's prying eyes. Centuries later, Izzet researchers have uncovered some of Kwalish's notes. Desperate to locate the chemister's laboratory, the Izzet League reaches out to the characters to accomplish the task.": "如果你的战役设定在拉夫尼卡的城市世界，如{@book Guildmasters' Guide to Ravnica|GGR}所述，Kwalish可能是Izzet联盟的一名化学家，他离开公会，远离Niv-Mizzetr的窥视，追求自己的工作。几个世纪后，伊泽特的研究人员发现了夸利什的一些笔记。由于急于找到化学家的实验室，伊泽特联盟向这些人物伸出援手，以完成这项任务。",
	"If you're running a campaign making use of {@adventure Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage|WDMM}, Kwalish's laboratory might contain secrets useful in the exploration of Undermountain. Or you could have some of the dungeon's deadly features be strange mechanical-magical devices reminiscent of Kwalish's work. The secrets to controlling or disabling such devices might be instrumental to a successful foray into the legendary dungeon.": "如果你正在运行一个使用（%0%）的活动，Kwalish的实验室可能包含对探索Undermountain有用的秘密。或者你可以让地牢的一些致命特征成为奇怪的机械魔法装置，让人联想到Kwalish的工作。控制或禁用这些设备的秘密可能对成功进入传说中的地牢很有帮助。",
	"A massive magical-mechanical golem, an unknown planar vessel, or some other rare threat has appeared in civilized lands. Though local settlements are safe for the moment, the characters are charged with tracking down Kwalish and his laboratory in hopes that the secrets to disabling the imminent threat might be found there.": "一个巨大的魔法机械傀儡，一个未知的星球容器，或者其他一些罕见的威胁已经出现在文明的土地上。虽然当地的居民点暂时是安全的，但角色们负责追踪Kwalish和他的实验室，希望能在那里找到解除迫在眉睫的威胁的秘诀。",
	"A powerful marut (detailed in {@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}) hunts one or more of the characters for breaking some cosmic contract. Their only hope of survival is to find Kwalish's laboratory, whose planar magic holds the means of restoring the balance the marut seeks to enforce.": "一个强大的马鲁特（详见{@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}）追捕一个或多个角色，因为他们违背了某种宇宙契约。他们唯一的生存希望是找到Kwalish的实验室，他的平面魔法拥有恢复马鲁特所寻求的平衡的手段。",
	"The characters are hired by a gnome sage known as the Cartophile for a mission of exploration, as he seeks to complete a failed expedition to Daoine Gloine undertaken by his ancestors. The characters must find their way to the lost city hidden within the Barrier Peaks, then return with its location.": "这些人物受雇于一位被称为 \"Cartophile \"的地精圣人，执行一项探索任务，因为他要完成他的祖先对Daoine Gloine的一次失败的探险。他们必须找到隐藏在壁垒山峰中的失落之城，然后带着它的位置返回。",
	"Alternatively, the characters might hear rumors of Kwalish's legendary {@item Powered Armor|LLK} (see {@adventure appendix D|LLK|7}), and embark on a mission to find it. Or you might have them discover a set of {@item Powered Armor|LLK} in a previous adventure, leaving them needing to find a way to access it—or to free an NPC currently trapped inside it. Either way, finding Kwalish's lost laboratory is the key.": "或者，人物可能会听到关于Kwalish的传奇（%0%）（见{@adventure appendix D|LLK|7}）的传言，并开始执行任务去寻找它。或者你可以让他们在之前的冒险中发现一套{@item Powered Armor|LLK}，让他们需要找到进入它的方法，或者释放目前被困在里面的NPC。无论怎样，找到Kwalish丢失的实验室是关键。",
	"No matter what hook brings the characters into the adventure, any research into Kwalish's lost laboratory—or any NPC familiar with the inventor's failed expedition to the Barrier Peaks—establishes that seeking out the gnome known as the Cartophile is a crucial first step for their mission.": "无论什么样的钩子将角色带入冒险，对Kwalish丢失的实验室的任何研究--或者任何熟悉发明家对屏障山峰的失败探险的NPC--都会发现寻找被称为 \"嗜卡者 \"的地精是他们任务的关键第一步。",
	"Anaxi Zephries is a wealthy gnome merchant and sage. He is well known for his vast collection of maps, which cover the known world, pocket dimensions, routes across the planes, and more. In this role, the Cartophile has served as patron for numerous expeditions of exploration, sending adventurers to all corners of the world—both to draw new maps and to verify the authenticity of others already in his possession.": "阿纳西-泽弗里斯是一位富有的地精商人和圣人。他因收集了大量的地图而闻名，这些地图涵盖了已知的世界、袖珍空间、穿越位面的路线等等。在这个角色中，\"制图者 \"曾作为众多探险队的赞助人，将冒险者派往世界各个角落--既要绘制新的地图，又要验证他手中的其他地图的真实性。",
	"The gnome's collection contains notes and an initial map from the early stages of Kwalish's expedition into the Barrier Peaks. In exchange for allowing the characters to use that lore, he asks only that any further journals, notes, maps, and other documents from Kwalish's earlier expedition be returned to him.": "地精的收藏中包含了Kwalish对屏障之峰的早期探险的笔记和一张初始地图。作为允许角色使用这些传说的交换条件，他只要求将Kwalish早期探险中的任何其他日记、笔记、地图和其他文件归还给他。",
	"The Cartophile has no interest in adventuring, talking of how he once stood too close to a {@item Bag of Holding} accidentally placed within a {@item Portable Hole} and never fully recovered from it. However, in the interest of ensuring a successful mission, he offers the characters the services of a number of hirelings in his employ—and insists that at least one of those hirelings accompany the party, to serve as custodian of his maps and materials.": "嗜图者对冒险没有兴趣，他说他曾经站得太近，不小心把一个{@item Bag of Holding}放在了一个{@item Portable Hole}里面，然后就再也没有完全恢复过来。然而，为了确保任务的成功，他向人物提供了一些他雇佣的雇工的服务--并坚持要求这些雇工中至少有一个人随行，作为他的地图和资料的保管人。",
	"If the characters develop an especially close relationship to the Cartophile, the gnome might reveal that his professional career commissioning expeditions and maps has been background research for a personal obsession. One of his ancestors took part in Kwalish's lost expedition to find Daoine Gloine, the mythical city of the Barrier Peaks inhabited by \"people of glass.\" The gnome has long sought to learn the truth of the expedition's demise.": "如果人物与制图师建立了特别密切的关系，地精可能会透露，他委托探险和地图的职业生涯一直是个人痴迷的背景研究。他的一个祖先参加了Kwalish的失落的探险，以寻找Daoine Gloine，那个由 \"玻璃人 \"居住的壁垒山峰的神话城市。侏儒长期以来一直在寻求了解探险队灭亡的真相。",
	"Any of the following NPCs can join the party as custodians and translators of the materials loaned to the characters by the Cartophile. Each hireling is also charged with chronicling the party's progress along the way, in the hope of finally mapping the route to Daoine Gloine, and has specific value to the party in certain areas of expertise. However, each hireling also has one or more secret agendas that might work against the characters' interests.": "以下任何一个NPC都可以加入队伍，作为Cartophile借给人物的材料的保管人和翻译。每个雇佣兵都负责记录党派沿途的进展，希望最终绘制出通往道恩-格洛因的路线，并且在某些专业领域对党派有特殊价值。然而，每个雇工也有一个或多个秘密议程，可能会对人物的利益产生不利影响。",
	"You can let the party's size and the players' interest in bringing NPCs into their group determine whether more than one of the Cartophile's hirelings join the expedition. Or, instead of front-loading hirelings at the start, these NPCs can be set up as independent explorers not connected to the Cartophile. You can stagger their introduction throughout the course of the adventure (as suggested in each NPC's description below), with each one able to provide a useful next step to help the expedition along.": "你可以让队伍的规模和玩家对把NPC带入他们的队伍的兴趣来决定是否有超过一个嗜车者的雇佣者加入探险队。或者，这些NPC可以被设定为与嗜车者无关的独立探险者，而不是一开始就把雇佣者放在前面。你可以在整个冒险过程中错开介绍他们（正如下面每个NPC的描述中所建议的那样），每个人都可以提供一个有用的下一步来帮助探险队前进。",
	"Once a dwarven warrior, Ctenmiir was transformed into a {@creature Vampire} and hidden away within White Plume Mountain (see {@adventure Tales from the Yawning Portal|TftYP}) until captured there by an Emerald Enclave ranger. The vampire has long been imprisoned within a magical iron coffin mounted atop animated golem legs (an early Kwalish design), forced to atone for his evil deeds by working for the Cartophile.": "曾经是一名矮人战士的克滕米尔被改造成了一个{@creature Vampire}，藏在白翎山(见{@adventure Tales from the Yawning Portal|TftYP})里，直到被一名翡翠飞地的游侠抓住。长期以来，这个吸血鬼一直被囚禁在一个神奇的铁棺材里，铁棺材被安装在灵动的格木腿上（早期Kwalish设计），被迫通过为Cartophile工作来赎罪。",
	"Ctenmiir's coffin has a speed of 30 feet and a climbing speed of 10 feet, and protects the vampire from sunlight even as it prevents him from escaping his servitude. Though Ctenmiir is able to speak from within the coffin and help guide the expedition, the coffin obeys only the commands of the party members. Cold, calculating, and manipulative, the vampire aids the party as long as he believes he can earn his release from the coffin along the way—by any means possible.": "Ctenmiir的棺材有30英尺的速度和10英尺的攀爬速度，可以保护吸血鬼不受阳光照射，即使它阻止他逃脱他的奴役。虽然克滕米尔能够在棺材里说话并帮助指导探险，但棺材只听从党员的命令。吸血鬼冷酷无情、精打细算、善于操纵，只要他认为自己可以通过任何可能的方式从棺材中获得释放，他就会协助党的工作。",
	"Originally native to an area near the Barrier Peaks, Ctenmiir has much experience with the initial route into the mountains, and can provide warnings of early encounters through the fey woods and foothills (see \"{@area Reaching the Peaks|028|x},\" below, and {@adventure appendix A|LLK|4}). The vampire's coffin can also serve as a makeshift {@item Apparatus of Kwalish} at your determination, making it easier for characters to explore Daoine Gloine—though Ctenmiir will need to first be released. The coffin can also be used as protective shelter against adversaries, including a freed Ctenmiir.": "Ctenmiir原产于壁垒峰附近的地区，对进入山区的最初路线有很多经验，并能在早期遇到费城森林和山麓时提供警告（见下面的\"（%0%）\"和（%1%））。吸血鬼的棺材也可以作为你决定的临时{@item Apparatus of Kwalish}，使人物更容易探索道恩-格洛--尽管需要先释放克滕米尔。棺材也可以作为保护性的庇护所来对付敌人，包括被释放的Ctenmiir。",
	"Get out of the coffin. Feed on at least one character.": "从棺材里出来。至少以一个角色为食。",
	"If Ctenmiir does not start with the party, he might instead be found in the foothills, in the possession of outlaws seeking the monastery who use the vampire as their guide.": "如果克滕米尔没有和队伍一起出发，他可能会在山脚下被寻找修道院的歹徒占有，这些歹徒把吸血鬼当作他们的向导。",
	"If he joins the expedition from the start, the vampire might lead the characters to the foothills, then claim to no longer recognize the route ahead.

Alternatively, the Grand Master might send over a squad of five monks ({@creature Cultist||Cultists}) led by an elder monk ({@creature Cult Fanatic}) to investigate the sphinx's death and assess the characters' potential threat.": "在狮身人面像的精神指令下，飞行渡轮从修道院的码头被召唤出来，越过悬崖壁架。如果狮身人面像被杀，渡船也会来，遵守大法师的命令，任何强大的访客都会被带到魔鬼的面前。另外，大法师可能会派一个由五名僧侣（{@creature Cultist||Cultists}）组成的小队在一名长老僧侣（{@creature Cult Fanatic}）的带领下，调查狮身人面像的死亡，并评估人物的潜在威胁。",
	"A pulse of fire marks something igniting at the edge of the floating island, alongside its distant dock. Something detaches and floats smoothly towards you—a flying skiff piloted by a hooded figure.": "一阵火光标志着有什么东西在浮岛的边缘点燃了，就在远处的码头边上。有东西脱离并平稳地飘向你--由一个蒙面人驾驶的飞行船。",
	"The ferry is operated by a {@creature Merrenoloth|MTF} (originally from {@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF}). It is crafted from laboratory debris attached to a small engine similar to the large engines holding the monastery aloft. The skiff can ferry up to ten Medium creatures at one time, and can be controlled automatically by the merrenoloth, Gearbox the modron, or a rescued brain in a jar (see area M8). A character can decipher the controls of a skiff with a successful DC 15 Intelligence check, allowing that character to control it. A skiff also requires at least one fully charged energy cell from the treasury (area M10) for fuel.": "这艘渡船是由一个{@creature Merrenoloth|MTF}(最初来自{@book Mordenkainen's Tome of Foes|MTF})操作的。它是由实验室的碎片制作而成，连接着一个类似于支撑修道院高空的大型引擎的小型引擎。这艘船一次最多可运送10个中型生物，并可由merrenoloth、Gearbox the modron或罐子里的获救大脑（见M8区）自动控制。一个角色可以通过成功的DC15智力检查来破译小艇的控制，从而使该角色能够控制它。一艘快艇还需要至少一个来自宝库（M10区）的充满电的能量电池作为燃料。",
	"The merrenoloth stays silent, but any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check to glimpse beneath its hood sees a skeletal face. (The character can later note the resemblance between this visage and the monastery's flayed monks.)": "梅里诺洛特保持沉默，但任何通过DC14智慧({@skill Perception})检定成功的角色都能瞥见它头巾下的一张骷髅脸。(角色后来可以注意到这张脸与寺院的剥皮僧侣之间的相似性。）",
	"If any character is unfortunate enough to fall from the cliff, the other characters quickly lose sight of them in a light mist that covers the valley floor. Any subsequent search for a body comes up empty—because a floating teleportation-field device (see the sidebar) zooms around the bottom of the valley, and automatically teleports the falling character into the prison cells at area M6.": "如果有哪个角色不幸从悬崖上掉下来，其他角色很快就会在覆盖谷底的轻雾中失去踪影。随后对尸体的搜索都是空的--因为一个漂浮的传送场装置（见边栏）会在谷底放大，并自动将坠落的角色传送到M6区的牢房。",
	"The crashed planar craft still makes up most of the monastery's general structure, having been long ago converted into Kwalish's first laboratory, then converted again into this present sinister site. The overall sense of the place—as evidenced in the alien geometries of its buildings and its exposed technology—should be one of a brooding, otherworldly environ where nothing feels quite right.": "坠毁的平面飞行器仍然构成了寺院的大部分总体结构，很久以前被改造成Kwalish的第一个实验室，然后又被改造成现在这个阴森的地方。这个地方的整体感觉--从其建筑的异形几何形状和暴露的技术中可以看出--应该是一个忧郁的、另一个世界的环境，没有什么感觉是对的。",
	"Over long years, the monastery has drawn hundreds of dark recruits to its hidden location, through both whispered rumor and dark outreach to criminals seeking refuge from the law. Though the vast majority of those recruits have perished or been imprisoned at the hands of the Grand Master, twenty-five monks—all a motley assemblage of evil humanoids—currently occupy various areas of the monastery. All wear cowled robes to conceal their features, which can be seen only if a monk is forced to unmask, or if a watchful character gets close to a monk and succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. Any monk whose face is seen shows an identical grim countenance—a face flayed nearly to the bone, the result of a brutal initiation to better match the appearance of the Grand Master.": "漫长的岁月里，通过低声的传言和对寻求法律庇护的罪犯的黑暗宣传，该寺院已经吸引了数百名黑暗的新兵来到它的隐蔽地点。虽然这些新兵中的绝大多数已经在大法师手中丧生或被囚禁，但25名僧侣--所有邪恶的人形生物的杂乱组合--目前占据着寺院的各个区域。所有的人都穿着有罩子的长袍来掩盖他们的特征，只有当一个僧侣被迫揭开面具，或者当一个警觉的人物接近一个僧侣并成功通过DC12智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查时，才能看到这些特征。任何被看到的僧侣的脸都显示出相同的狰狞面孔--一张几乎被剥去骨头的脸，这是为了更好地匹配大法师的外表而进行的残酷的启动仪式的结果。",
	"Wherever they are initially stationed, the monks all gather together if a general alarm is sounded, or to witness an audience in the central abbey (area M3). Each monk is a {@creature Cultist} that carries a smaller version of a bone devil's hooked polearm (see the sidebar in the \"Bone Devil\" section in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}), typically disguised as a staff or tool:": "无论他们最初驻扎在哪里，如果有总警报响起，僧侣们都会聚集在一起，或者在中央修道院（M3区）见证一个观众。每个僧侣都是一个{@creature Cultist}，携带一个较小版本的骨魔的钩状杆枪（见{@book Monster Manual|MM}中 \"骨魔 \"部分的侧边栏），通常伪装成法杖或工具。",
	"{@i Melee Weapon Attack}: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@i Hit}: 4 ({@dice 1d6 + 1}) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is {@condition grappled} (escape DC 10). Until this grapple ends, the monk cannot use its polearm on another target.": "{@i Melee Weapon Attack}: 命中率+3，范围5英尺，一个目标。{@i Hit}: 4 ({@dice 1d6 + 1})穿刺伤害。如果目标是中型或小型生物，则是{@condition grappled}（逃脱DC 10）。在这个抓取动作结束之前，僧侣不能对另一个目标使用它的杆状武器。",
	"In addition, each group of five monks is led by an elder monk. These are {@creature Cult Fanatic||Cult Fanatics} that have outfitted their polearms with laser weapons secured from the monastery's stores of technology. These weapons are notoriously ineffective against polished metal armor and shields, which reflect their laser bolts:": "此外，每组五名僧侣由一名长老僧侣领导。这些人都是{@creature Cult Fanatic||Cult Fanatics}在他们的杆枪上装备了从寺院的技术仓库中获得的激光武器。这些武器对抛光的金属盔甲和盾牌是出了名的无效，因为它们会反射激光炮弹。",
	"{@i Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack}: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 40/100 ft., one creature. {@i Hit}: 7 ({@dice 1d10 + 2}) force damage. The attack has disadvantage against any target with polished metal armor or shield, and has its ranged halved when firing through smoke or fog.": "{@i Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack}: 命中率+4，范围5英尺或40/100英尺，一个生物。{@i Hit}: 7 ({@dice 1d10 + 2})武力伤害。攻击对任何有抛光金属盔甲或盾牌的目标都是不利的，当通过烟雾或雾气发射时，其范围减半。",
	"A force pike uses an energy cell (see area M10), expending one charge for each successful attack. If claimed as treasure, a pike's cell holds {@dice 2d10} remaining charges. If you prefer not to have such weapons fall into the hands of the characters, then whenever an elder monk is defeated, its force pike automatically overheats and explodes.": "力量长矛使用一个能量电池（见M10区域），每次成功的攻击都会消耗一个电荷。如果被认作是宝物，长矛的电池可以保持（%0%）的剩余电量。如果你不想让这种武器落入人物手中，那么每当一个长老僧侣被打败时，它的长矛就会自动过热并发生爆炸。",
	"One of the more impressive bits of technology from the crashed planar craft, teleportation-field devices consist of two matched magical-mechanical rings. Both rings channel the power of teleportation and flight, and were originally used to undertake repairs on the outside of the craft, handle dangerous substances at a distance, and so forth.": "从坠毁的平面飞船中获得的更令人印象深刻的技术之一，传送场装置由两个匹配的魔法机械环组成。这两个环都能引导传送和飞行的力量，最初是用来在飞船外部进行维修，在远处处理危险物质，诸如此类。",
	"When a creature passes an arm or other appendage into one ring, that appendage appears to emerge from the other ring, no matter how far apart the devices are. The second device has a flying speed of 40 feet, and can be flown remotely under the creature's control as part of its own movement. The remote device also grants the creature a sensory awareness of the area around it. This allows the appendage to be used normally, so that the creature can undertake any activity remotely that it could accomplish close up, including making physical ability checks and attacks.": "当一个生物将手臂或其他附属物传入一个环中时，该附属物就会从另一个环中出现，无论这些装置相距多远。第二个装置的飞行速度为40英尺，并且可以在生物的控制下远程飞行，作为其自身运动的一部分。远程装置也赋予生物对其周围区域的感官意识。这使得该附属装置可以正常使用，因此该生物可以在远程进行任何它可以近距离完成的活动，包括进行物理能力检查和攻击。",
	"Because they are linked to the planar craft, teleportation-field devices function only in the monastery and in Daoine Gloine (where Kwalish has used the magical-mechanical technology of the craft to set up his new lab). If the characters manage to secure a pair of such devices, you can let the players come up with novel ways to make use of them in those locations (assigning appropriate Intelligence checks if you want to make the process difficult). However, they can't be claimed as treasure.": "因为它们与平面飞船相连，所以传送场装置只在修道院和道恩-格洛因（Kwalish在那里利用飞船的魔法-机械技术建立了他的新实验室）发挥作用。如果角色们设法获得了一对这样的装置，你可以让玩家想出新奇的方法来在这些地方利用它们（如果你想让这个过程变得困难，可以指定适当的智力检查）。但是，它们不能作为宝物被认领。",
	"The Monastery of the Distressed Body has been secretly drawing in outlaws for decades. As such, you might add to the ranks of the monks with any number of villainous NPCs the players have heard about, or even foes that slipped through their clutches in years past. Sir Bluto Sans Pite from White Plume Mountain in {@adventure Tales from the Yawning Portal|TftYP} is a good candidate, as are Faroul and Gondolo from Port Nyanzaru in {@i Tomb of Annihilation}.": "几十年来，\"痛苦的身体 \"修道院一直在秘密地吸引着不法之徒。因此，你可以用玩家们听说过的任何数量的反派NPC，甚至是过去几年中从他们的魔掌中溜走的敌人来增加僧侣的队伍。来自{@adventure Tales from the Yawning Portal|TftYP}的白翎山的Bluto Sans Pite爵士是个不错的人选，来自{@i Tomb of Annihilation}的Nyanzaru港的Faroul和Gondolo也是。",
	"The monks do not interfere as the characters initially explore the monastery, and they keep their cowls down if they are approached. They say little about the workings of the place, but vaguely hint at how newcomers will be welcome to either join their \"immured brothers\" (the prisoners in area M6) or the \"enlightened ones\" (the brains in jars in the control room of area M8). They readily direct characters toward the Grand Master in the central abbey (area M3). If the monks are harassed, or if the characters spend too much time exploring on their own, Lean Meimbaol from area M1 arrives to personally escort them to the abbey.": "角色们最初探索修道院时，僧侣们并不干涉，如果有人接近他们，他们也会把头巾放下。他们对这个地方的运作几乎不闻不问，只是含糊地暗示新来者将被欢迎加入他们的 \"被监禁的兄弟\"（M6区的囚犯）或 \"开明的人\"（M8区控制室里装在瓶子里的大脑）。他们很容易将人物引向中央修道院（M3区）的大法师。如果僧侣们受到骚扰，或者角色们花了太多时间独自探索，M1区的Lean Meimbaol会亲自护送他们到修道院。",
	"If combat breaks out, the monks all reveal their true natures, and attempt to overwhelm and capture the characters.": "如果战斗爆发，僧侣们都会暴露出他们的真实本性，并试图压倒和俘虏这些角色。",
	"Some thirty humanoid prisoners ({@creature Commoner||Commoners}) are held in the monastery. All have had their faces flayed to make them barely distinguishable from the monks. Most work in the engine room (area M5) during the day, and are penned together at night in the cells of area M6. A smaller group of more dangerous humanoids has been permanently imprisoned in that same area.": "寺院里关押着大约三十名人形囚犯（{@creature Commoner||Commoners}）。所有的人都被剥去了脸皮，使他们几乎无法与僧侣们区分开来。大多数人白天在机房（M5区）工作，晚上则被关在M6区的牢房里。一小部分更危险的人形生物被永久地囚禁在同一区域。",
	"Several of the prisoners are survivors from previous expeditions sent into the Barrier Peaks by the Cartophile. They recognize any of the hirelings with the characters, or any other signs of the Cartophile's patronage (maps, notebooks, and so forth). Once contact has been made, they look to help the characters—especially if this also leads to their own escape. However, most of the other prisoners are former monks that tried to leave or otherwise got into trouble, and they look to curry favor with their captors by reporting subversive activity.": "有几个囚犯是以前被嗜车者派往壁垒峰的探险队的幸存者。他们能认出任何与人物在一起的雇佣者，或者任何其他有Cartophile赞助的迹象（地图、笔记本等等）。一旦取得联系，他们就会去帮助这些人物--特别是如果这也会导致他们自己的逃跑。然而，大多数其他囚犯都是试图离开或陷入麻烦的前僧侣，他们希望通过报告颠覆活动来讨好他们的俘虏。",
	"The following locations are identified on the map on page 9.": "第9页的地图上确定了以下地点。",
	"The merrenoloth's ferry departs from and arrives at this metallic dock. As the characters arrive, an elder monk named Lean Meimbaol greets them.": "Merrenoloth的渡船从这个金属码头出发并到达。当人物到达时，一位名叫Lean Meimbaol的长老和尚向他们问好。",
	"A figure dressed as a hooded monk stands beside the dock, awaiting your arrival. Though he does not lower his cowl, he greets you warmly.": "一个打扮成蒙面僧人的人物站在码头边上，等待着你的到来。虽然他没有放下他的头罩，但他热情地迎接你。",
	"\"Congratulations on your finding us! The Monastery of the Distressed Body remains ever open to new prospects. I am sure the Grand Master will find suitable use for your bodies... or your minds. May I take you to him now?\"": "\"祝贺你找到我们! 痛苦的身体寺院对新的前景永远是开放的。我相信大法师会为你们的身体......或你们的思想找到合适的用途。我现在可以带你们去见他吗？\""
