	"An elder warlock from the goblinoid swamp village of Urzin has been kidnapped by soldiers of the Dwendalian Empire. Now the machinations of an evil imperial inquisitor might unleash an evil that could threaten the garrison at Fort Venture and the goblinoids of Urzin alike. \"Unwelcome Spirits\" is a Wildemount adventure that takes characters from 1st to 3rd level, and which introduces them to Wildemount's desolate and foreboding Eastern Wynandir region.": "乌尔津妖精沼泽村的一位长老术士被德文达尔帝国的士兵绑架了。现在，一个邪恶的帝国审问者的阴谋可能会释放出一种邪恶，可能会威胁到风险堡垒的驻军和Urzin的妖精们。\"不受欢迎的灵魂 \"是荒野山庄的一次冒险，需要1到3级的角色，并向他们介绍荒野山庄荒凉和不祥的东温南迪尔地区。",
	"If your players are using the heroic chronicle to create their characters (see {@book chapter 4|EGW|5|Heroic Chronicle}), you can talk with them about creating characters with ties to Urzin or nearby Xhorhasian settlements. Alternatively, characters from elsewhere might be traveling to Urzin, whether individually or as a group. Since this adventure ties directly to the Kryn Dynasty's conflict with the Dwendalian Empire, you can also ask each player to consider their character's stance on the war and how the war might tie into their background.": "如果你的玩家使用英雄编年史来创建他们的角色（见{@book chapter 4|EGW|5|Heroic Chronicle}），你可以和他们讨论创建与乌尔钦或附近的Xhorhasian定居点有关系的角色。另外，来自其他地方的角色可能会前往乌尔钦，无论是个人还是团体。由于这次冒险直接关系到克莱恩王朝与德文达尔帝国的冲突，你也可以要求每个玩家考虑他们的角色对战争的立场，以及战争可能与他们的背景有关。",
	"Trouble has come to the roaming village of Urzin, which slowly ambles through the wastes of Xhorhas atop the massive, mossy shells of horizonback tortoises. The village's elder seer, the goblin warlock {@creature Bol'bara|EGW}, has gone missing. Three nights ago, while foraging by night for rare alchemical ingredients, Bol'bara was beset by a cadre of Dwendalian Empire soldiers near the foothills of Brokenveil Bluffs. On the orders of an imperial inquisitor named {@creature Parson Pellinost|EGW}, the goblin warlock was forcefully escorted to the local garrison for questioning—and for magical experimentation.": "麻烦来到了游荡的乌尔津村，它在巨大的、长满青苔的地平线乌龟壳上缓慢地在Xhorhas的荒原上行走。村里的老预言家，地精术士（%0%），已经失踪了。三天前的晚上，博尔巴拉在夜里觅食稀有的炼金材料时，被德文达尔帝国的一干士兵围困在断肠崖的山脚下。在一位名叫{@creature Parson Pellinost|EGW}的帝国审讯官的命令下，地精术士被强行押送到当地的驻军处接受审讯--用于魔法实验。",
	"What neither the imperial forces nor the goblinoids of Urzin know is that Bol'bara was performing a series of rare communal rites near a site of major arcane significance. With those rites interrupted, she is now in the throes of possession by her patron, a shadow demon known as Trush. If its dark power is set free, Trush could wreak havoc across the wastes of Xhorhas, using Bol'bara as its worldly vessel.": "帝国军队和乌尔钦的妖精们都不知道的是，博尔巴拉正在一个具有重大奥秘意义的地点附近进行一系列罕见的公共仪式。由于这些仪式被打断，她现在正处于被她的守护者--一个被称为Trush的影子恶魔--占有的痛苦之中。如果它的黑暗力量被释放出来，特鲁什可能会在Xhorhas的荒野上造成破坏，把博尔巴拉作为它的世界容器。",
	"In the political absence of the champion chief of Urzin, Sunbreaker Olomon, the village's proud and protective acting leader is {@creature Ogre Lord Buhfal II|EGW}. Buhfal seeks to resolve the plight of the missing warlock, {@creature Bol'bara|EGW}, which he worries will threaten the frail alliances among the village's restless goblinoids. He and his advisors suspect the nearby imperial outpost at Fort Venture has something to do with Bol'bara's fate. However, Buhfal knows that goblinoids advancing on Fort Venture will draw reprisals against Urzin, so he seeks an outside group who might more easily seek the warlock there and bring her back to help safeguard the settlement.": "在Urzin的冠军首领Sunbreaker Olomon的政治缺席下，村子里骄傲和保护的代理领袖是（%0%）。布法尔试图解决失踪的术士的困境，{@creature Bol'bara|EGW}，他担心这会威胁到村里不安分的妖精们之间脆弱的联盟。他和他的顾问们怀疑附近的帝国前哨冒险堡与Bol'bara的命运有关系。然而，布法尔知道，妖精族向冒险堡进发会引来对乌尔钦的报复，所以他寻找一个外部团体，他们可能更容易在那里找到术士并把她带回来帮助保护定居点。",
	"At Buhfal's behest, the characters must chart a course to the Brokenveil Bluffs with the help of a hobgoblin guide, locate Fort Venture, and extract Bol'bara. Unfortunately, the reckless aims of the imperial inquisitor Parson Pellinost and his lackeys work to undermine their efforts. Without a timely interruption, the torturous interrogation of Bol'bara will lead to her possession by Trush, her shadow demon patron—and to a series of calamitous arcane events. Trush's demonic rampage will start at Fort Venture before wending its way back to Urzin—and it's up to the adventurers to do something about it.": "在Buhfal的要求下，这些人物必须在一个妖精向导的帮助下制定一条前往Brokenveil Bluffs的路线，找到Fort Venture，并救出Bol'bara。不幸的是，帝国审讯官帕森-佩里诺斯特（Pellinost）和他的走狗们鲁莽的目标破坏了他们的努力。如果不及时打断，对Bol'bara的折磨性审讯将导致她被她的影子恶魔守护者Trush占有，并导致一系列灾难性的神秘事件。特鲁什的恶魔暴行将从风险堡垒开始，然后蜿蜒回到乌尔钦，而冒险者们要做的就是对此采取行动。",
	"Before starting the adventure, work with your players as they talk about why their characters have come to Urzin. Details regarding this unique settlement and its politics can be found in {@book chapter 3|EGW|4|Urzin}. The {@creature Horizonback Tortoise|EGW|horizonback tortoises} that give the village its mobility are detailed in {@book chapter 7|EGW|8|Horizonback Tortoise}. Goblinoid or orc characters might be residents of Urzin, but characters of other races are probably visitors to this remote settlement—and are probably feeling very much out of their element.": "在开始冒险之前，与你的玩家一起讨论他们的角色为什么会来到乌尔钦。关于这个独特的定居点及其政治的细节可以在（%0%）中找到。赋予村子流动性的{@creature Horizonback Tortoise|EGW|horizonback tortoises}详见{@book chapter 7|EGW|8|Horizonback Tortoise}。哥布林人或兽人角色可能是乌尔钦的居民，但其他种族的角色可能是这个偏远定居点的访客，而且可能感到非常不适应。",
	"This is also a good time to figure out if the characters already know each other or if this adventure is the first time they've met. If none of the characters are goblinoids, they most likely already make up an adventuring party and have traveled to Urzin together.": "这也是一个很好的时间来弄清楚这些角色是否已经认识对方，或者这次冒险是他们第一次见面。如果没有一个角色是地精，那么他们很可能已经组成了一个冒险队伍，并且一起去了乌尔钦。",
	"Whether the characters are local to the area or have traveled to Urzin, the adventure starts with them being summoned to an audience with {@creature Ogre Lord Buhfal II|EGW}, leader of the village. The characters might have made it known that they are mercenary adventurers seeking work, or they might simply look the part. Alternatively, if they are all strangers to the village, Lord Buhfal might approach them simply because he wants there to be no connection between the characters and the village if their intended mission goes bad.": "无论角色是当地人还是到过乌尔津，冒险的开始都是他们被召唤去觐见村子的领袖（%0%）。这些人物可能已经表明他们是寻找工作的雇佣兵冒险家，或者他们可能只是看起来像个人物。另外，如果他们都是村子里的陌生人，布法尔大人可能会接近他们，因为他希望如果他们的任务出了问题，人物和村子之间没有任何联系。",
	"The tone of the adventure and the read-aloud text assumes that the characters find Urzin a strange and exotic location. If the party consists of some or all goblinoids or other natives of Urzin, adjust the flavor and the read-aloud text accordingly.": "冒险的基调和朗读的文字都假设人物认为乌尔钦是一个奇怪的异域地点。如果一行人中有部分或全部是地精或其他乌尔钦的土著，请相应地调整味道和朗读文本。",
	"Once the players are ready to begin, read or paraphrase the following to set the scene:": "一旦玩家准备好开始，就读或转述以下内容来设定场景。",
	"The rank odors of the Brokenveil Marsh mingle with the musty aroma of a fleet of gargantuan reptiles as you traverse the rickety rope bridges above Urzin. This strange goblinoid village moves slowly and endlessly through the swampy Xhorhasian wastes, its structures set atop the massive shells of horizonback tortoises. Urzin's monstrous residents pay you little heed until you approach the large, ramshackle hall of Ogre Lord Buhfal II—a towering structure of haphazard timber and scrap.": "当你穿越乌尔津上空摇摇欲坠的绳索桥时，断壁沼泽的高级气味与巨大的爬行动物舰队的霉味混合在一起。这个奇怪的妖精村在沼泽的霍哈斯荒原上缓慢而无休止地移动，它的结构设置在地平线龟的巨大龟壳之上。乌尔津的怪物居民对你不屑一顾，直到你走近食人魔领主布法尔二世的大型破烂大厅--一个由杂乱无章的木材和废品组成的高耸结构。",
	"If the characters enter the hall of Ogre Lord Buhfal II, add the following:": "如果人物进入食人魔领主布法尔二世的大厅，请添加以下内容。",
	"The din of the swamp and the hushed chatter of Urzin's residents is muted as you step through the folds of a heavy leather curtain into the chamber beyond. There, the reek of the marsh is quickly replaced by the favorable scent of roasted meats and spiced wine. Orc attendants gesture you toward a litter of dingy furs before the seat of Buhfal II, who allows you to settle in before his baritone voice issues a welcome.": "当你穿过厚重的皮革帘子的褶皱，进入外面的房间时，沼泽地的喧嚣和乌尔钦居民沙哑的交谈声被压制了。在那里，沼泽的恶臭很快就被烤肉和香料酒的好闻气味所取代。兽人侍从向你打手势，示意你到布法尔二世的座位前坐下，他允许你在他的男中音发出的欢迎声中坐下。",
	"\"Eat. Drink. But be wary, for the empire has come to Xhorhas, bringing damnation with it!\"": "\"吃。喝吧。但要警惕，因为帝国已经来到了Xhorhas，带来了诅咒！\"",
	"{@creature Ogre Lord Buhfal II|EGW}—a lawful evil, male {@creature ogre} with an Intelligence score of 10—explains the current situation to the characters:": "{@creature Ogre Lord Buhfal II|EGW}--一个合法的邪恶，男性{@creature ogre}，智力值为10--向人物解释目前的情况。",
	"Since his father was slain forty years earlier by the Kryn paragon Sunbreaker Olomon, Buhfal II has seen a slow swell of discontent among Urzin's goblinoid population, who labor tirelessly to execute the Kryn Dynasty's clandestine agendas. An increasing number of Urzin's residents look to Buhfal and his advisors for leadership, despite the dynasty's overt hold on the area.": "自从他的父亲在四十年前被克莱恩的典范破日者奥洛蒙杀死后，布法尔二世看到乌尔津的地精人口中慢慢涌现出不满的情绪，他们不知疲倦地执行克莱恩王朝的秘密议程。越来越多的乌尔津居民期待布法尔和他的顾问们的领导，尽管王朝对该地区有明显的控制。",
	"Three nights ago, Buhfal's most trusted counselor, the goblin witch {@creature Bol'bara|EGW}, journeyed to the foothills of the Brokenveil Bluffs to the west, where she regularly forages for ritual components. She never returned.": "三天前的晚上，布法尔最信任的顾问，地精女巫（%0%），前往西边的断肠崖山脚下，她经常在那里觅取仪式的组件。她再也没有回来。",
	"Buhfal doesn't know what happened to her, but he knows that Dwendalian Empire patrols had been spotted in the area in previous weeks. The patrols strike out from an outpost known as Fort Venture, which watches over the Brokenveil Bluffs.": "布法尔不知道她发生了什么事，但他知道前几周在该地区发现了德温达利安帝国的巡逻队。巡逻队从一个被称为 \"风险堡垒 \"的前哨站出击，该堡垒监视着断肠崖。",
	"An elder villager who remembers the reign of the first Buhfal, Bol'bara is Urzin's chief loremaster and a pivotal ally in both the ongoing battle against the empire and the enduring struggle against the cruel environs of the Xhorhasian swamps. Little is known of Bol'bara's otherworldly patron, but her warlock powers are respected by all.": "Bol'bara是一位年长的村民，他记得第一个Buhfal的统治，他是Urzin的首席理论家，在与帝国的持续战斗和与Xhorhasian沼泽地的残酷环境的持久斗争中都是一个关键的盟友。人们对波尔巴拉的另一个世界的守护者知之甚少，但她的术士能力受到所有人的尊重。",
	"Without Bol'bara's arcane protections and political guile, Buhfal fears his people will grow submissive to the Kryn Dynasty's whims, making Urzin a more notable target for imperial reprisals.": "没有Bol'bara的神秘保护和政治诡计，Buhfal担心他的人民会越来越顺从克林王朝的想法，使Urzin成为帝国报复的更显著目标。",
	"{@creature Ogre Lord Buhfal II|EGW|Buhfal} hires the characters to locate the goblin warlock and retrieve her. For rescuing {@creature Bol'bara|EGW} from her kidnappers, the ogre lord agrees to pay 200 gp and to provide the characters with \"premium weapons.\"": "{@creature Ogre Lord Buhfal II|EGW|Buhfal}雇佣角色去寻找地精术士并救回她。为了从绑匪手中救出（1%），食人魔领主同意支付200金币，并为人物提供 \"高级武器\"。",
	"Buhfal suggests that the characters begin by reconnoitering the imperial garrison at Fort Venture to the west, under the keen supervision of a {@creature hobgoblin} scout named Morgid.": "布法尔建议，在一位名叫莫吉德（%0%）的侦察员的热心监督下，人物开始对西边冒险堡的帝国驻军进行侦查。",
	"As they make preparations, the characters discover that the \"premium weapons\" Lord Buhfal promises are anything but. Each character receives their choice of any simple melee weapon from {@table weapons|phb|chapter 5} of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, but these are crude weapons of goblinoid design. With resources scarce in Urzin, goblinoid-made weapons are often hastily crafted and cheap.": "当他们做准备时，角色们发现布法尔勋爵承诺的 \"高级武器 \"并不是什么。每个角色都可以从{@table weapons|phb|chapter 5}的{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}中选择任何简单的近战武器，但这些都是地精设计的粗糙武器。由于乌尔钦的资源匮乏，地精制造的武器往往是仓促制作的，而且价格低廉。",
	"Characters looking for better gear can equip themselves (at normal prices) for the journey through Brokenveil Marsh by visiting one of Urzin's merchants. Popular stops in the village include the following:": "寻找更好的装备的角色可以通过拜访Urzin的一个商人来装备自己（以正常的价格），以便穿越Brokenveil沼泽。村子里受欢迎的地方包括以下几家。",

	"The area between Urzin and Fort Venture is encompassed by the boggy morass of the Brokenveil Marsh. Unless otherwise noted, all areas of the marsh are {@quickref difficult terrain||3}. The bog water in the marsh averages from 1 to 5 feet deep, but is too shallow and weed-bound for boats or rafts. Tiny creatures must have a swimming speed or be carried to traverse this watery terrain.": "乌尔津和冒险堡之间的区域被断肠草沼泽的沼泽地所覆盖。除非另有说明，否则沼泽地的所有区域都是（%0%）。沼泽中的沼泽水平均有1到5英尺深，但对于船只或木筏来说太浅，而且杂草丛生。微小的生物必须有游泳的速度，或者被人抬着才能穿越这块水土。",
	"Any character not used to this environment who takes a short or long rest within the swamp without being on raised dry ground must make a DC 11 Constitution check.

	"At the start of each new travel day, the DM makes a DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Survival}) check on behalf of the navigator. This check determines whether or not the party becomes lost over the course of the day. Apply a +5 bonus to the check if the group sets a slow pace for the day, or a −5 penalty if the group is moving at a fast pace. It's possible to get lost on a river by following a tributary instead of the main branch.": "在每个新的旅行日开始时，DM代表领航员进行DC 15智慧（{@skill Survival}）检查。这个检定决定了队伍在这一天中是否会迷路。如果队伍设定了一天的慢节奏，则对该检查施加+5的奖励；如果队伍以快节奏行进，则施加-5的惩罚。沿着支流而不是主支流在河上迷路是有可能的。",

	"Morgid (a neutral, male {@creature hobgoblin}) is an able scout, but his allegiance is tenuous. He gladly shares his map with the party and is keen to join in on the investigation of any landmarks or other points of interest, even as he warns of the importance of not dallying in the marsh.

The Mossback Steward is more than willing to use its powers of divination to assist characters who display an honest interest in forcing the Dwendalian military out of Brokenveil Marsh.": "不过，有一点是清楚的。自从风险堡垒的驻军建立后，沼泽地的原始和谐就被破坏了。莫斯贝克管家非常愿意使用它的占卜能力来帮助那些对迫使德文达尔军队离开断桥沼泽表现出真诚兴趣的人物。",
	"As the characters draw close to the fort, flashes of lightning and the sound of thunder should grow more prevalent.": "随着人物接近堡垒，闪电和雷声应该越来越多。",
	"The Dwendalian stronghold known as Fort Venture sits along a dismal stretch of marsh among the craggy foothills of the Brokenveil Bluffs. A timber palisade surrounds the fort's squat stone keep and muddy grounds, where rows of tents are set up alongside a central training field. The green timber of its battlements hint at the recent construction of this remote military outpost, while the bright colors of its quarried stonework and foreign banners readily betray its distinctly non-Xhorhasian heritage.": "被称为 \"风险堡垒 \"的德文达利人的据点坐落在断壁残垣的山脚下，沿着一片凄凉的沼泽。堡垒周围有一个木制的栅栏，它是用石头砌成的，地面泥泞不堪，一排排的帐篷搭在中央训练场旁边。垛口的绿色木材暗示着这个偏远的军事前哨最近才建成，而其采石场和外国旗帜的鲜艳色彩则轻易地暴露了其明显的非霍哈斯遗产。",
	"Read the following when the characters first catch sight of the fort:": "当人物第一次看到堡垒时，请阅读以下内容。",
	"The swamp gives way to a grassy shoreline beneath a low promontory, on which sits a modest stone keep surrounded by a tall wooden palisade. Weather-worn Dwendalian flags hang forlornly above the massive front gate and from decorative pikes rising from the keep. Several rows of spiked barricades surround the palisade as a defense against the predators of Brokenveil Marsh.": "沼泽地让位于一个低矮的海角下的草丛海岸线，海角上坐落着一个由高大的木制栅栏包围的适度的石头堡垒。饱经风霜的德文达尔人的旗帜孤零零地挂在巨大的前门上，以及从堡垒上升起的装饰性长矛上。栅栏周围有几排带刺的路障，以防御断肠草沼泽的掠夺者。",
	"A jagged bolt of lightning suddenly cuts through the misty air above the keep, striking the edifice as a mighty crack of thunder rumbles off to the horizon.": "一道锯齿状的闪电突然划破了堡垒上方虚无缥缈的空气，击中了这座建筑，同时一声巨大的雷声响起，向地平线飞去。",
	"Fort Venture is detailed on {@adventure map 5.12|US|0|Map 5.12: Fort Venture View Player Version}.

	"Once the characters reach Fort Venture, the hobgoblin guide Morgid offers to run reconnaissance and to distract incoming Dwendalian patrols as the party infiltrates the fort. The precise condition of Fort Venture and its inhabitants is dependent on how long it took the characters to arrive, and how much of {@creature Parson Pellinost|EGW|Parson Pellinost's} ill-fated exorcism of {@creature Bol'bara|EGW} has transpired. See \"{@adventure Bol'bara's Exorcism|US|0|Bol'bara's Exorcism}\" later in this chapter for more information.": "当人物到达风险堡垒时，妖精向导Morgid提议进行侦查，并在队伍潜入堡垒时引开来犯的德文达利亚巡逻队。风险堡垒及其居民的确切情况取决于角色们花了多长时间到达，以及{@creature Parson Pellinost|EGW|Parson Pellinost's}命运多舛的驱魔仪式{@creature Bol'bara|EGW}发生了多少。更多信息见本章后面的\"{@adventure Bol'bara's Exorcism|US|0|Bol'bara's Exorcism}\"。",
	"Having successfully navigated the challenges of Brokenveil Marsh, the characters reach 2nd level when they arrive at Fort Venture.": "在成功渡过断肠沼泽的挑战后，人物在抵达冒险堡时达到了2级。",
	"The Dwendalian Empire's hold on Eastern Wynandir is tenuous at best, and the ramshackle garrison at Fort Venture is testament to the empire's attempt to solidify its influence. Despite the outpost's modest appearance, its freshly laid stonework and newly erected battlements offer solid protection against the harsh environs and deadly creatures of the Brokenveil Marsh.": "Dwendalian帝国对东Wynandir的控制充其量是脆弱的，而Venture堡垒的破旧驻军则证明了帝国试图巩固其影响力。尽管这个前哨站外观简陋，但它新铺设的石块和新竖起的城墙提供了坚实的保护，以抵御恶劣的环境和Brokenveil沼泽中致命的生物。",
	"Commander Struther Felmont and the Dwendalian soldiers at the fort have grown callous and cruel under the leadership of Imperial Inquisitor {@creature Parson Pellinost|EGW}, who conducts deranged experiments on the humanoids of the marsh with an unsavory and sadistic application of divine magic. The guards of Fort Venture engage in defense, training, and patrol work in eight-hour shifts. Few of those guards respect Pellinost, but all obey him for fear of strict retribution.": "指挥官斯特拉瑟-费尔蒙和堡垒里的德文达利亚士兵在帝国审讯官（%0%）的领导下变得冷酷无情，残酷无情，他对沼泽地里的人类进行疯狂的实验，对神圣的魔法进行令人不齿的虐待性应用。风险堡垒的守卫从事防御、训练和巡逻工作，每班8小时。这些守卫中很少有人尊重佩里诺斯特，但所有的人都服从他，因为害怕受到严格的报复。",
	"The party's travel time from Urzin to Fort Venture determines whether the goblin warlock {@creature Bol'bara|EGW} is still a prisoner of the empire or has become an unfettered vessel of demonic possession and torn the fort apart. After three days of torture and experimentation, Parson Pellinost triggers Bol'bara's full demonic possession—making her powerful enough to kill the inquisitor and escape captivity.": "队伍从乌尔钦到风险堡垒的旅行时间决定了地精术士（%0%）是仍然是帝国的囚犯，还是已经成为一个不受约束的恶魔附身的容器，并将堡垒撕碎。经过三天的折磨和实验，帕森-佩里诺斯特触发了波尔巴拉完全的恶魔附身，使她的力量足以杀死审问者并逃脱囚禁。",
	"If the characters spend the minimum three days traversing the marsh and enter Fort Venture at once, they can either prevent the second phase of Bol'bara's possession or become witness to it. With or without the party's intervention, once Bol'bara enters the second phase of her possession, she plots a return to Urzin and attempts to destroy anyone and anything in her way.": "如果角色们花了至少三天的时间穿越沼泽，并立即进入冒险堡，他们可以阻止波尔巴拉附身的第二阶段，或者成为它的见证人。无论是否有党的干预，一旦Bol'bara进入她附身的第二阶段，她就会策划回到Urzin，并试图摧毁任何阻碍她的人和事。",
	"{@creature Parson Pellinost|EGW|Parson Pellinost's} methods of interrogation for \"troublemakers\" are considered savage by normal imperial standards, but the remote location of the outpost and the soldiers' fear of him have worked in his favor. {@creature Bol'bara|EGW} is of particular interest to the inquisitor, who has been torturing her to death, then bringing her back again using divine healing magic. Bol'bara's full demonic possession is triggered at the end of the third day after the characters set out from Urzin, when Pellinost utilizes the {@spell revivify} spell a third time to bring Bol'bara back to life.": "{@creature Parson Pellinost|EGW|Parson Pellinost's}对 \"麻烦制造者 \"的审讯方法按正常的帝国标准被认为是野蛮的，但前哨站的偏远位置和士兵对他的恐惧对他有利。(1%)对审问者特别感兴趣，他一直把她折磨得死去活来，然后用神圣的治疗魔法让她再次复活。Bol'bara的完全恶魔附身是在人物从Urzin出发后的第三天结束时触发的，当时Pellinost第三次利用{@spell revivify}的咒语使Bol'bara复活。",
	"Once {@creature Bol'bara|EGW} enters the next phase of her demonic possession, she gains two legendary actions granted by the unique supernatural union with her otherworldly patron (see her stat block later in this adventure). Most areas of Fort Venture will be affected by her escape, as indicated by additional descriptive text in the \"Bol'bara's Possession\" section in each area of the fort. Use the appropriate text depending on whether the characters arrive before Bol'bara has been fully corrupted and have a chance to stop the process, or whether her spree of destruction is already underway.": "一旦{@creature Bol'bara|EGW}进入她的恶魔附身的下一阶段，她就会获得与她的异世界守护者的独特超自然结合所赋予的两个传奇行动（见本冒险中稍后的她的状态块）。风险堡垒的大部分区域都会受到她逃跑的影响，正如堡垒中每个区域的 \"波尔巴拉的附身 \"部分的额外描述性文字所指出的。使用适当的文字，取决于人物是在博尔巴拉完全被腐蚀之前到达，并有机会阻止这一过程，还是她的破坏狂潮已经开始了。",
	"Even if they are too late to stop Bol'bara's possession, the characters might want to try to parley with the demon-possessed warlock. Give the players any chance of success that seems appropriate to their efforts, but remember that the shadow demon behind Bol'bara's transformation is a creature of chaos. It savors the taste of discord, and convincing Trush to relinquish its hold over the witch won't be easy.": "即使他们来不及阻止Bol'bara的附身，角色们也可能想尝试与被恶魔附身的术士交涉。给玩家们提供任何适合他们努力的成功机会，但要记住，博尔巴拉转变背后的影子恶魔是一种混乱的生物。它喜欢不和谐的味道，而说服特鲁什放弃对女巫的控制并不容易。",
	"The palisade wall around the fort is easily scouted and assessed from a distance, but more difficult to get past. When the characters draw close to the fort, read:": "堡垒周围的栅栏墙很容易从远处侦察和评估，但更难逾越。当人物接近要塞时，请阅读。",
	"The wooden palisade that encloses Fort Venture stands over ten feet high and is topped by huge spikes. A gate in the middle of the east wall is flanked by two watchtowers and appears to be the only way in or out of the complex. The parapet of the fort's stone keep can be seen rising up from the center of the grounds. Tall grass and knotted brambles partially obscure a well-trodden path that winds up to the gate from the marsh. Rows of spiked barricades encircle the palisade, completing the appearance of a well-fortified military outpost.": "围住风险堡垒的木制栅栏有十多英尺高，上面有巨大的尖刺。东墙中间的大门两侧有两个瞭望塔，似乎是进出该建筑群的唯一途径。可以看到堡垒的石头护栏从场地中央升起。高高的草和打结的荆棘部分地掩盖了一条从沼泽地蜿蜒到大门的熟习的道路。一排排带刺的路障环绕着围墙，使人觉得这是一个防御严密的军事前哨。",
	"At any given time, each watchtower (including the two towers bordering the gate) is occupied by a Dwendalian {@creature guard} equipped with a crossbow and a torch. The guards work in eight-hour shifts, with two guards present at each watchtower during shift changes. Characters who attempt to sneak into Fort Venture must find a way to avoid being spotted by the watchtower guards, whose position gives them advantage on all Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) checks to notice activity on the grounds around or inside the palisade.": "在任何时候，每个瞭望塔（包括与大门接壤的两座塔）都有一个配备有弩和火把的德文达利人（%0%）。卫兵们八小时轮流工作，换班时每个瞭望塔都有两名卫兵。试图潜入风险堡垒的人物必须想办法避免被瞭望塔的守卫发现，他们的位置使他们在所有的智慧（{@skill Perception}）检查中具有优势，可以注意到围墙周围或内部的活动。",
	"Strangers approaching the fort are hailed by the watchtower guards and ordered to identify themselves. At the first sign of trouble (and the guards are inclined to view anything out of the ordinary as ‘trouble'), a guard sounds an alarm on a horn whose call can be heard across the fortress.": "靠近要塞的陌生人会被瞭望塔的守卫叫住，并被命令表明自己的身份。一旦出现麻烦的迹象（守卫倾向于将任何不正常的事情视为 \"麻烦\"），守卫就会用喇叭发出警报，整个堡垒都能听到其呼叫。",
	"Scores of bear traps are hidden among the tall grass in a 40-foot-wide area surrounding the palisade. A character with a passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score of 12 or higher is able to spot the traps and avoid them. Characters who don't spot the traps have a {@chance 50|50 percent} chance of stepping on a bear trap and triggering it whenever they move through the area.": "在围墙周围40英尺宽的区域内，有数十个捕熊器藏在高高的草丛中。一个被动智慧（（%0%））得分在12分以上的角色能够发现这些陷阱并避开它们。没有发现陷阱的角色在经过该区域时，有1%的机会踩到熊的陷阱并触发它。",
	"A bear trap's attack is +8 to hit and deals 5 ({@dice 1d10}) piercing damage on a hit. This attack can't be made with advantage or disadvantage. A creature hit by the trap also has its speed reduced to 0 and can't move until it breaks free of the trap. Breaking free requires a successful DC 15 Strength check by the trapped creature or another creature within 5 feet of the trap. A successful DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools disables a bear trap.": "捕熊器的攻击是+8的命中率，并在命中时造成5({@dice 1d10}的穿刺伤害。这种攻击不能以优势或劣势进行。被陷阱击中的生物的速度也会降低到0，并且不能移动，直到它挣脱陷阱。挣脱需要被困住的生物或在陷阱5英尺范围内的其他生物成功进行DC15力量检查。使用盗贼的工具，成功地进行DC10的灵巧检查，可以使熊的陷阱失效。",
	"Though visually formidable, these barricades built of crossed rows of spiked poles pose a threat only to Large and larger creatures.

	"The garrison of Fort Venture are all experienced soldiers and treat all creatures outside the fort as potential threats. Characters who approach them intent on diplomacy or intimidation are met with swift opposition. Using crossbows or spears from their watchtower vantage points, the guards attack any character who engages in conversation with them for more than 1 round.": "风险堡垒的驻军都是经验丰富的士兵，他们把堡垒外的所有生物都视为潜在的威胁。靠近他们的角色如果打算进行外交或恐吓，会遭到迅速的反对。守卫们在瞭望塔的有利位置使用弓箭或长矛，攻击任何与他们交谈超过1回合的角色。",
	"The rough-cut logs of the palisade are relatively easy to climb, notwithstanding the risk of being seen. A character must succeed on a DC 12 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check to climb up the wall, followed by the same check to descend the other side unless a rope is lowered down. At the top of the wall, a character must make a DC 12 Dexterity ({@skill Acrobatics}) check to safely slip up and over the palisade spikes. On a failed check, the character takes 3 ({@dice 1d6}) piercing damage.": "尽管有被发现的风险，但栅栏上粗糙的原木还是比较容易攀爬的。角色必须通过DC12力量({@skill Athletics})检定才能爬上墙，然后再通过同样的检定才能从另一边下来，除非有绳子放下来。在墙的顶端，角色必须进行DC12的灵巧（（%1%））检定，以安全地滑上并越过栅栏的尖刺。如果检定失败，角色会受到3({@dice 1d6})的穿刺伤害。",
	"The gate into Fort Venture is a sturdy door of iron-banded oak timbers and can be barricaded from within by a 20-foot-long iron crossbar.
