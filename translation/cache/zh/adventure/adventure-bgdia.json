	"Designed for an adventuring party of four to six 1st-level characters, {@i Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus} is a Dungeons & Dragons adventure that begins in the city of Baldur's Gate and ends in Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. By the end of the adventure, the characters should be 13th level or higher. To run this adventure, you need the fifth edition {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, and {@book Monster Manual|MM}.": "专为四到六个一级角色的冒险队伍设计，{@i Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus}是一个龙与地下城的冒险，从博德之门的城市开始，在九层地狱的第一层阿弗纳斯结束。在冒险结束时，人物应该达到13级或更高的水平。要运行这个冒险，你需要第五版（%%1%）、（%%2%）和（%%3%）。",
	"Use the first session of the game to help your players create their 1st-level characters. As part of this process, the players can choose their party's dark secret (see \"{@area Dark Secrets|3ec|x}\").": "利用游戏的第一个环节来帮助你的玩家创建他们的第一级角色。作为这个过程的一部分，玩家可以选择他们党派的黑暗秘密（见\"（%0%）\"）。",
	"The holy city of Elturel has disappeared from the Forgotten Realms and descended into Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. This event came about as the result of an infernal bargain between the archdevil Zariel, who rules Avernus, and the treacherous High Overseer of Elturel, {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}. Zariel is capturing cities and using their citizens as fodder in the ongoing conflict between demons and devils known as the Blood War. Next on Zariel's list of cities is Elturel's neighbor, Baldur's Gate. The characters can be the heroes who descend into Avernus, save Elturel from certain destruction, and prevent a similar fate from befalling Baldur's Gate.": "圣城Elturel已经从被遗忘的领域中消失了，降到了九层地狱的第一层Avernus。这一事件的发生是由于统治阿弗纳斯的大恶魔扎里尔和背叛的艾尔图勒高级监督者（%0%）之间的地狱交易的结果。扎里尔正在占领城市，并在恶魔和魔鬼之间正在进行的被称为血战的冲突中利用他们的公民作为炮灰。在Zariel的城市名单上，下一个是Elturel的邻居Baldur's Gate。这些角色可以成为进入阿弗纳斯（Avernus）的英雄，将Elturel从必然的毁灭中拯救出来，并防止类似的命运降临到Baldur's Gate身上。",
	"{@adventure Chapter 1|BGDIA|1} begins in the independent city of Baldur's Gate, where the characters find themselves trapped behind the city's walls after the gates are sealed to keep out hundreds of refugees from the neighboring land of Elturgard. However, the gates can't hold back news that Elturgard's capital has fallen, and that Grand Duke {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA} of Baldur's Gate is missing—lost on a diplomatic mission to Elturel. The fact that Elturel's misfortune coincided with Ravengard's visit has left Baldurians wondering whether Baldur's Gate will suffer Elturel's fate.": "{@adventure Chapter 1|BGDIA|1}开始于独立城市Baldur's Gate，在那里人物发现自己被困在城墙后面，因为城门被封，以阻止来自邻国Elturgard的数百名难民。然而，城门无法阻挡Elturgard的首都已经沦陷的消息，Baldur's Gate的大公爵（%1%）失踪了--在前往Elturel的外交任务中失踪。Elturel的不幸与Ravengard的访问同时发生，这让Baldur人怀疑Baldur's Gate是否会遭受Elturel的命运。",
	"The characters are drafted by the Flaming Fist, the army of mercenaries tasked with protecting Baldur's Gate. Without Grand Duke {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA} to lead them, the Flaming Fist mercenaries are little more than glorified thugs. The characters' orders are to help maintain peace by rooting out and destroying followers of Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul—evil gods collectively known as the Dead Three. These vile priests, assassins, and necromancers are murdering city folk at random, and the Flaming Fist is too distracted and disorganized to hunt them down and find their lair. In the course of their investigation, the characters learn that the Dead Three cultists are secretly being financed by Thalamra Vanthampur, one of three remaining dukes who preside over the government of Baldur's Gate, using money stolen from the hoard of Tiamat, the evil queen of dragons imprisoned in the Nine Hells.": "这些人物是由火焰之拳征召的，这是一支负责保护博德之门的雇佣军。没有大公{@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA}的领导，火焰之拳的雇佣兵们不过是些光荣的打手。他们的任务是帮助维持和平，铲除并摧毁贝恩、巴哈和米尔库尔的追随者--这些邪恶的神灵统称为 \"死亡三人组\"。这些卑鄙的牧师、刺客和死灵法师正在随意谋杀城市居民，而火焰之拳分心且无组织，无法追捕他们并找到他们的巢穴。在调查过程中，角色们了解到，死灵三教派是由主持博德之门政府的三位剩余公爵之一的塔拉姆拉-范坦普尔秘密资助的，资金来自于被囚禁在九层地狱的邪恶龙后提亚马特的仓库。",
	"With Grand Duke {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA} out of the way, Thalamra is paying the Dead Three to shatter confidence in the Flaming Fist so that all payments to the decapitated organization can be cut off. Thalamra, a devout disciple of the archdevil Zariel, has brokered a deal that will enable her to claim the role of grand duke once the Flaming Fist disbands, paving the way for the city's descent into Avernus. To accomplish this last goal, Thalamra needs an artifact called the {@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA}, imprisoned in which is a pit fiend named Gargauth. Until recently, the shield was sealed in a tomb under the city, but Thalamra's sons recently stole it and transported it to the dungeon below their villa. So corrupt is the shield that its mere presence in Baldur's Gate has contributed to the city's moral decay for decades.": "随着大公（%0%）的出局，塔拉姆拉正在付钱给死亡三人组，以粉碎对火焰之拳的信心，这样就可以切断对这个被斩首组织的所有付款。塔拉姆拉是大恶魔扎里尔的虔诚弟子，她促成了一项交易，一旦火焰之拳解散，她就能要求担任大公爵的角色，为城市沦为阿弗纳斯铺平道路。为了实现这最后一个目标，萨拉姆拉需要一件名为{@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA}的神器，里面囚禁着一个名叫加加斯的坑道恶魔。直到最近，这面盾牌还被封存在城市下的一座坟墓里，但萨拉姆拉的儿子们最近偷走了它，并把它运到他们别墅下面的地牢里。这面盾牌是如此腐败，以至于它在博德之门的存在就导致了这个城市几十年来的道德败坏。",
	"To keep Baldur's Gate from falling into Zariel's clutches, the characters must take the shield far away from the city. Reya Mantlemorn, a young knight from Elturel, suspects that the Vanthampurs are sheltering {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA} at their estate and offers aid. Characters who storm Duke Vanthampur's villa find Thavius hidden in the dungeon below it. Thavius is helping Thalamra Vanthampur use the {@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA} to bring about the fall of Baldur's Gate, in much the same fashion he used the Companion (see \"{@area The Companion|007|x}\") to doom Elturel. If the characters slay Thavius, his soul travels to the Nine Hells and re-forms as an amnizu devil on Avernus (see \"\"{@area Poor Devil: Thavius Kreeg|2b8|x}\").": "为了不让博德之门落入扎里尔的魔掌，人物必须把盾牌带到远离城市的地方。来自Elturel的年轻骑士Reya Mantlemorn怀疑Vanthampur公爵在他们的庄园里避难{@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}，并提供了援助。冲进范坦普尔公爵别墅的人物发现塔维乌斯藏在别墅下面的地牢里。Thavius正在帮助Thalamra Vanthampur使用{@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA}来实现Baldur's Gate的衰落，这与他使用同伴（见\"{@area The Companion|007|x}\"）来毁灭Elturel的方式很相似。如果人物杀死了塔维乌斯，他的灵魂就会前往九层地狱，并在阿弗纳斯重新形成一个无主的魔鬼（见\"\"{@area Poor Devil: Thavius Kreeg|2b8|x}\"）。",
	"In the course of dealing with {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA} and the Vanthampur family, characters are likely to acquire the {@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA} as well as an {@item infernal puzzle box|BGDIA} that they can't open. They might also liberate a spy imprisoned in Duke Vanthampur's dungeon who works for {@creature Sylvira Savikas|BGDIA}, a tiefling expert on the Nine Hells. Determined to thwart devil worshipers in positions of power throughout the Western Heartlands, Sylvira operates out of the library of Candlekeep and has spent years monitoring devil activity in Baldur's Gate, Elturel, and the surrounding region. Her spies are after the puzzle box, which is believed to contain a copy of the fiendish contract Thavius signed to seal Elturel's doom.": "在与{@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}和Vanthampur家族打交道的过程中，人物有可能获得{@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA}以及一个他们无法打开的{@item infernal puzzle box|BGDIA}。他们还可能解放一个被囚禁在Vanthampur公爵地牢里的间谍，他为{@creature Sylvira Savikas|BGDIA}工作，一个研究九层地狱的铁皮人专家。西尔维拉决心挫败在整个西部心脏地带身居要职的魔鬼崇拜者，她在烛光之城的图书馆工作，并花了数年时间监视恶魔在博德之门、埃尔图勒以及周边地区的活动。她的间谍们正在寻找谜盒，据说里面有一份塔维斯签署的封印艾尔图勒厄运的恶魔契约的副本。",
	"If the characters wish to help Baldur's Gate further, they must journey to the Nine Hells and rescue {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA} from what's left of Elturel. The characters are urged to seek out {@creature Sylvira Savikas|BGDIA} in Candlekeep. Sylvira knows the secret to unlocking Thavius's puzzle box. She can also facilitate the characters' descent into Avernus and provide them with a map (albeit an unreliable one). Sylvira advises characters to leave the {@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA} in her custody. However, there are benefits to taking the shield with them, for Gargauth can guide them through the Nine Hells in ways others cannot. With or without the shield, the characters depart Candlekeep and visit Sylvira's friend, {@creature Traxigor|BGDIA}, a wizard who can use the {@spell plane shift} spell to get them to Elturel. At this wizard's tower, they meet a {@creature hollyphant|BGDIA} named {@creature Lulu|BGDIA}.": "如果角色希望进一步帮助博德之门，他们必须前往九层地狱，并从Elturel剩下的地方救出（%0%）。角色们被敦促在Candlekeep寻找（%1%）。西尔维拉知道解开塔维乌斯谜盒的秘密。她还可以帮助人物进入阿弗纳斯，并为他们提供一张地图（尽管是一张不可靠的地图）。西尔维拉建议人物把{@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA}交给她保管。然而，带着盾牌也有好处，因为加尔古斯能以其他人无法做到的方式引导他们穿越九层地狱。不管有没有盾牌，人物都要离开烛台镇，去拜访希尔维拉的朋友{@creature Traxigor|BGDIA}，一个可以使用{@spell plane shift}法术让他们去艾尔图勒的巫师。在这个巫师的塔里，他们遇到了一个名叫（%5%）的（%6%）。",
	"{@adventure Chapter 2|BGDIA|2} opens with the characters' arrival in Elturel, which is anchored by enormous chains and trapped under the baleful light of the Companion. If the characters do nothing, the city will be pulled down into the River Styx and bound to the Nine Hells forever. {@creature Lulu|BGDIA} tries her best to serve as the party's guide in Avernus, but the hollyphant's memories are fragmented. It becomes clear, however, that {@creature Lulu|BGDIA} has a personal connection to Zariel, dating back to the archdevil's former angelic existence.": "{@adventure Chapter 2|BGDIA|2}以人物到达Elturel开始，Elturel被巨大的锁链固定住，并被困在同伴的邪恶之光下。如果人物什么都不做，这座城市就会被拉到冥河里，永远被束缚在九幽地狱里。{@creature Lulu|BGDIA}尽力充当党在阿弗纳斯的向导，但冬青象的记忆已经支离破碎。然而，很明显，（2%）与扎里尔有个人联系，可以追溯到大恶魔以前的天使存在。",
	"After scouring Elturel for survivors and clashing with the denizens of Avernus, the characters encounter the valiant {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA}, who has been placed in the most unusual situation of defending a city he has long opposed. The beleaguered Ravengard urges the characters to do whatever they can to free Elturel and return what's left of it to Faerûn. To do so, they must scour Avernus for the means to destroy the Companion or break the enormous chains that shackle that city, as described in {@adventure chapter 3|BGDIA|3}.": "在搜寻Elturel的幸存者并与Avernus的居民发生冲突后，人物遇到了英勇的{@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA}，他被置于最不寻常的境地，保卫他长期反对的城市。陷入困境的拉文加德敦促角色们尽一切可能解放艾尔图勒，并将它剩下的东西归还给法鲁恩。要做到这一点，他们必须在Avernus寻找摧毁同伴或打破束缚该城市的巨大枷锁的方法，如{@adventure chapter 3|BGDIA|3}中所述。",
	"Avernus has long been a battlefield in the never-ending Blood War. Apart from clashing demons and devils, petty warlords scour the Avernian wastelands in search of treasure, salvage, and fuel for their infernal war machines. Characters who forge an alliance with one warlord risk alienating the others. By acquiring an infernal war machine, characters can travel quickly across Avernus—a domain rife with tortured souls, warmongers, and devils eager to tempt would-be heroes into soul-corrupting deals.": "长期以来，Avernus一直是永无止境的血战中的战场。除了恶魔和魔鬼的冲突之外，小军阀们还在阿维尼亚的荒原上寻找宝藏、残余物和他们的地狱战争机器的燃料。与一个军阀结盟的角色有可能疏远其他军阀。通过获得一台地狱战争机器，角色可以快速穿越阿弗纳斯--一个充斥着受折磨的灵魂、战争贩子和渴望诱惑未来的英雄进行灵魂腐蚀交易的恶魔的领域。",
	"The more time she spends with the characters, the more {@creature Lulu|BGDIA} begins to remember long-lost memories of the {@item Sword of Zariel|BGDIA}, an angelic weapon with the power to destroy the Companion. After Zariel's fall from grace, the sword was hidden in a stronghold called the Bleeding Citadel—a celestial sanctuary trapped in Avernus. The quest for the sword forms the crux of {@adventure chapter 4|BGDIA|7}, leading to the revelation that Zariel can be redeemed.": "她与这些人物相处的时间越长，{@creature Lulu|BGDIA}就越是开始回忆起久违的记忆，{@item Sword of Zariel|BGDIA}是一把具有摧毁同伴力量的天使武器。在扎里尔堕落之后，这把剑被藏在一个叫做 \"流血堡垒 \"的据点里--一个被困在阿弗纳斯的天体圣地。对这把剑的探索构成了{@adventure chapter 4|BGDIA|7}的关键，导致了扎里尔可以被救赎的启示。",
	"The characters' success doesn't hinge on acquiring the {@item Sword of Zariel|BGDIA} or helping Zariel find redemption, as Gargauth is quick to point out should the characters consult with him. There are other ways to free Elturel, but only if the characters are willing to cut deals with Avernus's most evil denizens. The characters might broker a deal with the deposed archdevil {@creature Bel|BGDIA}, who longs to supplant Zariel and regain his title as ruler of Avernus. They might stoke the rage of a horrific demon called {@creature Crokek'toeck|BGDIA} and trick it into gnawing through Elturel's chains. They might come to terms with an evil dragonborn paladin named {@creature Arkhan the Cruel|BGDIA}, using him to broker a deal with Tiamat. By returning her stolen treasure, characters can convince Tiamat to break Elturel's chains.": "人物的成功并不取决于获得{@item Sword of Zariel|BGDIA}或帮助Zariel找到救赎，因为如果人物向他咨询，Gargauth会很快指出。还有其他方法可以解救Elturel，但前提是角色们愿意与Avernus最邪恶的居民进行交易。角色们可能会与被废黜的大恶魔（%1%）进行交易，他渴望取代扎里尔，重新获得他作为阿弗纳斯统治者的称号。他们可能会激起一个叫做（%2%）的可怕恶魔的愤怒，并欺骗它咬断Elturel的链子。他们可能会与一个名叫（%3%）的邪恶龙裔圣骑士达成协议，利用他来促成与提亚马特的交易。通过归还她偷来的财宝，人物可以说服提亚马特打破Elturel的锁链。",
	"As tempting as such pursuits can be, the characters must be careful, for devil deals, demon lords, and Tiamat's rage number among the multiverse's greatest threats. Also, Zariel herself might become cross with the characters for daring to meddle in her diabolical affairs. How the adventure concludes depends on the choices the characters make, the chaos they foment, and the deals they forge, as discussed in {@adventure chapter 5|BGDIA|8}.": "尽管这种追求很诱人，但人物必须小心，因为魔鬼交易、恶魔领主和提亚马特的愤怒都是多元宇宙的最大威胁。另外，扎里尔本人也可能因为敢于插手她的邪恶事务而与角色发生冲突。冒险如何结束取决于人物的选择、他们煽动的混乱和他们达成的交易，如{@adventure chapter 5|BGDIA|8}所述。",
	"On the plane of Mount Celestia, the angel Zariel chastised her peers for not getting involved in the Blood War. She felt that it was the responsibility of the angelic host to destroy evil in the multiverse, rather than stand back and watch demons and devils annihilate one another, destroying vast swaths of the multiverse in the process. In defiance of her superiors, Zariel left Mount Celestia and went to Elturel, where she rallied an army of warriors and trained them to fight in the Blood War. She promised them that when they were ready, she would lead them into battle on Avernus.": "在天龙山上，天使扎丽尔责备她的同龄人没有参与到血战中。她觉得天使的责任是在多元宇宙中消灭邪恶，而不是站在后面看着恶魔和魔鬼互相消灭，在这个过程中摧毁大片的多元宇宙。为了反抗她的上级，扎丽尔离开了天龙山，去了Elturel，在那里她召集了一支战士的军队，训练他们参加血战。她向他们承诺，当他们准备好时，她将带领他们在阿弗纳斯作战。",
	"Zariel led her army out of Elturel amid a throng of cheering well-wishers and proud citizens in 1354 DR. In an epic charge known as the Ride, Zariel's army entered Avernus and took the fight to the archdevil {@creature Bel|BGDIA} and his infernal legions. Many of Zariel's warriors fought bravely, but for others, the horrors of the Nine Hells proved too great. They fled back through the portal, sealing it behind them and never revealing their shameful retreat and betrayal. The Hellriders, as they were called, would wear this badge of shame to the grave.": "1354年，扎丽尔率领她的军队在一众欢呼的祝福者和自豪的公民中离开了艾尔图勒。在一次史诗般的冲锋中，扎丽尔的军队进入了阿弗纳斯，与大恶魔（%0%）和他的地狱军团展开了战斗。许多扎里尔的战士英勇奋战，但对其他人来说，九层地狱的恐怖被证明是过于巨大的。他们从传送门逃了回来，把它封在身后，从不透露他们无耻的撤退和背叛。他们被称为 \"地狱骑士\"，他们将带着这个耻辱的徽章进入坟墓。",
	"Zariel lost more than her army on Avernus. She also lost a hand, which was severed in battle. As her sword fell to the ground, Zariel ordered Yael, her most devoted general, to take the weapon and hide it, so that the devils would not destroy or corrupt it. Yael took the sword and fled, along with Zariel's faithful hollyphant companion, {@creature Lulu|BGDIA}. Zariel's other two generals, Olanthius and Haruman, refused to leave Zariel's side. All three were captured and sent to Nessus, the lowest of the Nine Hells. There, Zariel was brought before Asmodeus, who welcomed her with open arms. The Lord of the Nine commended Zariel for her battle prowess and the strength of her convictions. He offered her rulership of Avernus, much to {@creature Bel|BGDIA}'s chagrin. By swearing fealty to Asmodeus and the Nine Hells, Zariel could bring her rage to bear against the demons and continue to fight in the Blood War, with legions of devils under her command. Zariel accepted Asmodeus's terms, completing her fall from grace. Haruman followed his master into damnation willingly and was transformed into a narzugon devil, while Olanthius, who took his own life rather than bow before Asmodeus, was brought back to serve as a death knight under Zariel's burning gaze.": "扎里尔在阿弗纳斯失去的不仅仅是她的军队。她还失去了一只手，这只手在战斗中被切断了。当她的剑掉在地上时，扎丽尔命令她最忠诚的将军雅尔拿着武器藏起来，这样魔鬼就不会破坏或腐蚀它了。雅儿拿着剑，和扎丽尔忠实的冬青象伙伴（%0%）一起逃走了。扎里尔的另外两个将军，奥兰修斯和哈鲁曼，拒绝离开扎里尔的身边。这三个人都被俘虏了，并被送往九层地狱中最低的内瑟斯。在那里，扎丽尔被带到阿斯莫德面前，他张开双臂欢迎她。九幽之主赞扬了扎丽尔的战斗力和她信念的力量。他为她提供了Avernus的统治权，这让(1%)的人感到非常懊恼。通过向阿斯莫德和九层地狱宣誓效忠，扎丽尔可以带着她的愤怒去对抗恶魔，继续在血战中战斗，并在她的指挥下组成恶魔军团。扎丽尔接受了阿斯莫德的条件，完成了她的陨落。哈鲁曼心甘情愿地跟随他的主人进入了地狱，并被转化为一个纳尔苏贡魔鬼，而奥兰修斯宁可自杀也不愿在阿斯莫德面前低头，他被带回来在扎丽尔灼热的目光下作为死亡骑士服务。",
	"Zariel never forgot her betrayers—those who ran from the battlefield. She kept a close eye on Elturel, waiting for the day when she could enact her revenge. That day came in 1444 DR, when Elturel was conquered by a vampire lord. A priest of Torm named {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA} appealed to any power to help him save his holy city. In that instant, Zariel emerged from a pillar of fire and offered him a deal, which Thavius readily accepted.": "扎里尔从未忘记她的背叛者--那些从战场上逃跑的人。她一直密切关注着Elturel，等待着有一天她可以实施她的复仇。这一天在公元1444年到来，Elturel被一个吸血鬼领主征服了。一位名叫{@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}的托尔姆的牧师呼吁任何力量帮助他拯救他的圣城。在那一瞬间，扎里尔从火柱中出现，向他提出了一个交易，塔维乌斯欣然接受。",
	"In the sky over Elturel, a radiant sphere called the Companion appeared, blazing like a second sun. Powered by a planetar imprisoned within it, the Companion bathed Elturel and the surrounding countryside in holy light which sent the vampire lord scrambling for the shadows and laid waste to his undead army. {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}, who took credit for summoning the Companion, was hailed as the savior of the city and rose to become its high overseer. Under Kreeg's decades-long rule, Elturel embarked on a path to becoming not just a holy city but the holy nation of Elturgard.": "在Elturel的上空，出现了一个被称为 \"同伴 \"的光芒四射的球体，像第二个太阳一样炽热。在一个被囚禁在其中的行星体的驱动下，同伴使艾尔图勒和周围的乡村沐浴在圣光之中，这让吸血鬼领主慌忙躲进阴影中，并浪费了他的亡灵军队。{@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}将召唤同伴的功劳归功于他，他被誉为城市的救世主，并升为城市的最高监督者。在克雷格数十年的统治下，埃尔图勒走上了一条道路，不仅成为了圣城，而且成为了埃尔图加德的圣国。",
	"Thavius was told the exact time when the Companion would cease to protect Elturel. In the weeks leading up to this fateful hour, Thavius urged Grand Duke {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA} of Baldur's Gate to visit Elturel, to help settle some longstanding disputes between the two cities. Facing political pressure at home, Ravengard reluctantly acceded. After greeting Ravengard's delegation, {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA} fled Elturel in secret and watched from a safe distance as the Companion transformed from a radiant sun into a black orb awash with crackling energy. It ripped Elturel from the Material Plane, transporting it and all its inhabitants to Avernus. A few other city folk managed to escape before Elturel disappeared. Where it once stood, only a crater remains.": "塔维乌斯被告知同伴将停止保护Elturel的确切时间。在这个决定性时刻到来之前的几周，塔维乌斯敦促博德之门的大公爵（%0%）访问Elturel，以帮助解决两个城市之间一些长期的争端。面对国内的政治压力，拉文加德不情愿地答应了。在迎接了拉文加德的代表团后，(1%)秘密地逃离了Elturel，并在安全距离上看着同伴从一个光芒四射的太阳变成了一个充斥着噼里啪啦能量的黑色球体。它把Elturel从物质世界中剥离出来，把它和它所有的居民都运到了Avernus。在Elturel消失之前，还有一些城市居民设法逃脱。它曾经站立的地方，只剩下一个火山口。",
	"Disguised as a refugee, {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA} was one of the first of his people to arrive at Baldur's Gate with news of Elturel's \"destruction.\" He slipped through the city's gates with the help of his influential friend, Duke Vanthampur, and took refuge in her home.": "伪装成一个难民，{@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}是他的族人中最早到达Baldur's Gate的Elturel \"毁灭 \"的消息之一。他在他有影响力的朋友Vanthampur公爵的帮助下溜进了城门，并在她家避难。",
	"As the DM, you can play devils as humorous, aloof, bombastic, conniving, or scatterbrained, but a general rule to follow is this: devils have no desire to do good. When dealing with mortals, devils are constantly figuring out how to exploit and corrupt them, often behind thin smiles of feigned concern and false charm.": "作为管理者，你可以把魔鬼扮演成幽默的、冷漠的、狂轰滥炸的、纵容的、或散漫的，但要遵循的一般规则是：魔鬼没有做好事的欲望。在与凡人打交道时，魔鬼不断地想出如何利用和腐蚀他们，往往是在假装关心和虚假魅力的薄薄的笑容背后。",
	"A devil that successfully corrupts a mortal gets the infernal equivalent of a gold star and can eagerly expect a superior to take notice and give it the promotion it so richly deserves. Meanwhile, when that mortal dies, its soul will find itself condemned to the Nine Hells where it twists into the form of a {@creature lemure} (unless it's used for some other morbid purpose). The devil doesn't care what becomes of the souls it corrupts; it just wants to be promoted to a superior form of devil. That's how, over ages, a {@creature lemure} might become a {@creature pit fiend}.": "一个成功腐蚀凡人的魔鬼会得到相当于一颗金星的地狱勋章，并急切地期望上级注意到它，给它以应有的晋升。同时，当那个凡人死后，它的灵魂会发现自己被判处到九层地狱，在那里它被扭曲成（%0%）的形式（除非它被用于其他病态的目的）。魔鬼并不关心它所腐蚀的灵魂会变成什么；它只想晋升为更高级的魔鬼形式。这就是为什么随着时间的推移，一个（1%）可能会变成一个（2%）。",
	"But devils do more than corrupt. They also fight in the Blood War. Asmodeus attests that serving in his infernal legion is a holy honor, for in so doing a devil helps protect the multiverse from demonic destruction. While that sounds impressive, most devils partake in the Blood War only to distinguish themselves among their peers and move up the chain of command. Endlessly fighting demons isn't what most devils signed up for.": "但魔鬼不仅仅是贪污。他们也在血战中战斗。阿斯莫德（Asmodeus）证明，在他的地狱军团中服役是一种神圣的荣誉，因为这样做的话，魔鬼可以帮助保护多元宇宙免受恶魔的破坏。虽然这听起来令人印象深刻，但大多数魔鬼参加血战只是为了在他们的同龄人中脱颖而出，并在指挥系统中获得晋升。无休止地与恶魔战斗并不是大多数魔鬼的目的。",
	"If a devil dies somewhere other than the Nine Hells, it re-forms in the Nine Hells and is therefore not truly killed. However, a devil that is killed in the Nine Hells is dead forever; not surprisingly, that's why devils tend to be more cautious in their dealings at home than abroad.": "如果一个魔鬼在九层地狱以外的地方死亡，它会在九层地狱重新形成，因此并没有真正被杀死。然而，在九层地狱被杀的魔鬼就会永远死去；这并不奇怪，这就是为什么魔鬼在国内的交易往往比国外更加谨慎。",
	"This adventure features the Nine Hells, which is described in {@book chapter 2|DMG|2|The Nine Hells} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}. Devils, being the primary inhabitants of the Nine Hells, play prominent roles in this story. Before running the adventure, it's worth taking the time to familiarize yourself with the \"Devils\" entry in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}, which not only describes the most common types of devils but also explains their hierarchy, how they behave in accordance with their lawful evil alignment, what pleases and enrages them, and why they're scared of dying on their home plane.": "这个冒险故事的特点是九层地狱，这在{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}的{@book chapter 2|DMG|2|The Nine Hells}中有所描述。魔鬼是九层地狱的主要居民，在这个故事中扮演着重要角色。在进行冒险之前，值得花时间熟悉一下{@book Monster Manual|MM}中的 \"魔鬼 \"条目，它不仅描述了最常见的魔鬼类型，还解释了它们的等级制度，它们如何按照合法的邪恶路线行事，什么会让它们高兴和愤怒，以及它们为什么害怕在自己的母体上死亡。",

	"Common traits among devils include the following:": "魔鬼的共同特征包括以下几点。",
	"{@b Charm}. Devils are consummate charmers. Like humans, some are better at it than others. The good ones savor the exchange of pleasantries, speaking in measured sentences or noticing pleasant details about the environment or a character's clothing.": "{@b Charm}. 魔鬼是完美的魅惑者。像人类一样，有些人比其他人更善于此道。优秀的人喜欢寒暄，用有分寸的句子说话，或注意到环境或人物服装的愉快细节。",
	"{@b Patience}. Devils are rarely in a rush to make a deal or sign a contract. As masters of the long con, devils make genuinely good deals with mortals to buy appreciation and trust that can be leveraged during more consequential dealings later on.": "{@b Patience}. 魔鬼们很少急于做交易或签合同。作为长期骗局的大师，魔鬼与凡人做真正的好交易，以购买赞赏和信任，这可以在以后更重要的交易中得到利用。",
	"{@b Civility}. Devils like to pretend that they run by the same rules and obey the same social conventions as mortals. Devils have no problem appearing and acting in whatever manner they need to achieve their end goal—usually a contract for services or a soul. They've learned that more can be gained from behaving in a civilized manner than reacting angrily or violently.": "{@b Civility}. 魔鬼喜欢假装他们和凡人一样遵循同样的规则，遵守同样的社会习俗。魔鬼以任何方式出现和行动都没有问题，他们需要实现他们的最终目标--通常是服务合同或灵魂。他们已经知道，与愤怒或暴力反应相比，以文明的方式行事可以获得更多好处。",
	"{@b Deviousness}. Devils don't age, so there's rarely a sense of urgency with a devil as it plots its conquest or corruption of a soul. This allows for winding schemes that are rarely what they seem on the surface. For minor devils, a simple acceptance of an evil gift is enough, while greater devils enjoy tangling up characters in choices that compromise their values.": "{@b Deviousness}. 魔鬼不会变老，所以当它策划征服或腐蚀一个灵魂时，很少有紧迫感。这就使得曲折的计划很少是表面上看起来的那样。对于小恶魔来说，简单地接受一个邪恶的礼物就足够了，而大恶魔则喜欢在损害其价值观的选择中纠缠角色。",
	"{@b Unscrupulousness}. Being evil and soulless, a devil cannot be embarrassed or shamed, doesn't feel guilt or remorse, and is prepared to do the most heinous acts to get what it wants.": "{@b Unscrupulousness}. 由于邪恶和没有灵魂，魔鬼不会感到尴尬或羞耻，不会感到内疚或悔恨，并准备做最令人发指的行为来获得它想要的东西。",
	"{@b Fear of Demotion}. A devil that disappoints a superior can be demoted, whereupon it's instantly transformed into a lesser form of devil. The greater the devil, the more it fears demotion and the loss of its power. Thus, a devil takes great pains to hide its failures or pin them on someone else.": "{@b Fear of Demotion}. 一个让上司失望的魔鬼可以被降级，这时它就会立刻变成一个较低级的魔鬼。越是伟大的魔鬼，越是害怕降级和失去权力。因此，魔鬼会不遗余力地隐藏自己的失败，或将其归咎于别人。",
	"Much of the adventure takes place on the first layer of the Nine Hells. This is not, to put it mildly, your run-of-the-mill D&D setting. The following tips and tricks can help you make the characters' stay in Avernus a remarkable one.": "冒险的大部分内容发生在九层地狱的第一层。可以说，这不是你的普通的D&D环境。下面的提示和技巧可以帮助你使人物在阿弗纳斯的逗留变得与众不同。",
	"The Nine Hells is a place of abject misery where no one is happy. Weaker devils are exploited and tormented by their superiors. Stronger devils live in constant fear of being passed over for promotion or demoted. Even when something seems to go right, joy is fleeting and only fuels suspicion that things are about to get much worse. Such inescapable pessimism leads many creatures to become apathetic and spiteful. They take perverse delight in spreading their unhappiness like a contagion.": "九层地狱是一个赤裸裸的苦难之地，没有人是幸福的。弱小的魔鬼被他们的上级剥削和折磨。强壮的魔鬼生活在不断的恐惧中，害怕被提拔或降级。即使有什么事情似乎是正确的，快乐也是转瞬即逝的，而且只会助长对事情即将变得更加糟糕的怀疑。这种不可避免的悲观主义导致许多生物变得冷漠和充满怨恨。他们反常地喜欢像传染病一样传播他们的不快乐。",
	"You can remind players that the Nine Hells is a place of misery and suffering in the following ways:": "你可以通过以下方式提醒玩家，九层地狱是一个苦难的地方。",
	"In conversations with the characters, natives of the Nine Hells like to bemoan their misfortune and blame others for their horrible lives.": "在与人物的对话中，九层地狱的当地人喜欢哀叹他们的不幸，并将他们可怕的生活归咎于他人。",
	"When a character accomplishes something, you can undercut that success in some small way. For example, the character's belt might snap, or a hellish insect might sting the character on the neck and leave a welt.": "当一个角色完成了某件事情时，你可以用一些小方法来削弱这种成功。例如，这个人物的腰带可能会断裂，或者一只地狱般的昆虫可能会刺伤这个人物的脖子并留下一道伤痕。",
	"If a character rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll made with a nonmagical weapon, you can decide that the weapon breaks.": "如果一个角色在用非魔法武器进行的攻击卷上掷出自然的1，你可以决定该武器破裂。",
	"Avernus is insidious in the way it fosters greed and makes visitors pay or barter for the things they need to survive. Most of the wildlife on Avernus is not edible to mortals, and most sources of water are poisonous or otherwise tainted. The rarity of edible food and drinkable water encourages hoarding behavior.": "Avernus的阴险之处在于它助长了贪婪，让游客为生存所需的东西付出代价或进行交易。Avernus上的大多数野生动物对凡人来说都是不可食用的，大多数水源都是有毒的或被污染的。可食用的食物和可饮用的水的稀有性鼓励了囤积行为。",
	"You can remind players about the awfulness of Avernus in the following ways:": "你可以通过以下方式提醒玩家阿弗纳斯的可怕之处。",
	"Any food or drink the characters bring with them or conjure by magic retains its nutritional value but tastes awful when eaten or imbibed on Avernus. The food tastes like ash, the water tastes like bile, and the wine tastes like spoiled milk.": "角色们带来的或用魔法变出的任何食物或饮料都保留了其营养价值，但在Avernus上吃或喝的时候味道很糟糕。食物的味道像灰，水的味道像胆汁，酒的味道像变质的牛奶。",
	"If the characters want something that tastes good, they must buy it from licensed sellers such as {@creature Mahadi the rakshasa|BGDIA}, who runs a restaurant called Infernal Rapture (see \"{@area Infernal Rapture|2a1|x}\"). The price of a good-tasting meal is always a bit too high.": "如果人物想吃好吃的东西，他们必须从有执照的卖家那里买，比如{@creature Mahadi the rakshasa|BGDIA}，他经营着一家叫 \"无间狂欢 \"的餐厅（见\"{@area Infernal Rapture|2a1|x}\"）。味道好的饭菜的价格总是有点太高。",
	"If a character commits a selfish act, you can reward that selfishness by granting that character inspiration (as described in {@book chapter 4|PHB|4|Inspiration} of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}). Unlike regular inspiration, the benefit can't be transferred to another creature.": "如果一个角色做出了自私的行为，你可以通过授予该角色灵感来奖励这种自私的行为（如{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}的{@book chapter 4|PHB|4|Inspiration}所述）。与普通的灵感不同，这种好处不能转移给另一个生物。",
	"Before the Blood War reduced it to a blasted wasteland, Avernus was a honey trap created by Asmodeus, a paradise of infinite delights designed to lure and enrapture mortals. Fragments of this lost paradise still plunge from Avernus's sky as burning meteors, and the land is dotted with the ruins of palaces and idyllic gardens that were obscenely beautiful in eons past.": "在血战将其变成一片废墟之前，阿弗纳斯是阿斯莫德创造的一个蜂蜜陷阱，一个充满无限乐趣的天堂，旨在引诱和迷惑凡人。这个失落的天堂的碎片仍然像燃烧的流星一样从阿弗纳斯的天空坠落，这片土地上遍布着宫殿和田园的废墟，在过去的岁月里，这些宫殿和田园是非常美丽的。",
	"Fleeting reminders of this ancient paradise can come to the characters in the following ways:": "对这个古老的天堂的短暂提醒可以通过以下方式出现在人物身上。",
	"While traveling across Avernus, the characters glimpse a fantastic mirage: a grand palace or garden oasis that vanishes when they get within 100 feet of it.": "在穿越Avernus时，人物瞥见了一个奇妙的海市蜃楼：一个宏伟的宫殿或花园绿洲，当他们进入100英尺范围内就会消失。",
	"A random character hears beautiful music or laughter, catches the scent of flowers or perfume, or experiences a gentle caress. The sensation has no discernible source and fades after a few moments.": "一个随机的角色听到了美妙的音乐或笑声，闻到了花香或香水的味道，或者经历了温柔的爱抚。这种感觉没有明显的来源，片刻之后就会消失。",
	"The characters find a relic that survived the fall of paradise, such as a beautiful vase or toppled statue. The first character to touch the relic experiences a fleeting moment of pure joy.": "角色们找到了在天堂沦陷中幸存下来的遗物，比如一个美丽的花瓶或被推翻的雕像。第一个触摸到遗迹的人物会体验到短暂的纯粹的快乐。",
	"Geography warps at the whims of the Nine Hells. One of the liberating aspects of this planar feature is that you don't need to be fastidious about keeping track of where locations are in relation to one another.": "地理环境随九层地狱的变化而变化。这种平面特征的一个自由方面是，你不需要快速跟踪地点之间的关系。",
	"While the spatial distortion can be unsettling to visitors, it affords you the following benefits as a DM:": "虽然空间上的扭曲会让游客感到不安，但作为DM，它为你带来了以下好处。",
	"You can decide how long it takes for characters to get from one place to the next. For example, the characters might need to travel 6 miles to get from Fort Knucklebone to Haruman's Hill, and 60 miles to get from Haruman's Hill back to Fort Knucklebone.": "你可以决定人物从一个地方到下一个地方需要多长时间。例如，人物可能需要走6英里才能从克努克勒本堡到哈鲁曼山，而从哈鲁曼山回到克努克勒本堡需要60英里。",
	"If the characters are in a rush to get somewhere, an {@creature imp} could appear out of nowhere and, for the price of a {@item soul coin|BGDIA} or other valuable item, show them a shortcut that halves the distance the characters must travel to reach their destination.": "如果人物急于去某个地方，一个{@creature imp}可以突然出现，并以{@item soul coin|BGDIA}或其他有价值的物品为代价，向他们展示一条捷径，使人物到达目的地的距离减半。",
	"The Wandering Emporium (see \"{@area The Wandering Emporium|297|x}\") can show up almost anywhere in the Nine Hells, at any time. If the players don't know where to go or what to do next, or if you want to surprise them with fun roleplaying opportunities, have the Wandering Emporium arrive at the party's location, regardless of where they saw it last.": "流浪帝王（见\"（%0%）\"）几乎可以在任何时候出现在九层地狱的任何地方。如果玩家不知道下一步该去哪里或做什么，或者你想用有趣的角色扮演机会给他们一个惊喜，那么让流浪帝王城到达聚会的地点，不管他们最后在哪里看到它。",
	"There are simple ways in which you can tailor the adventure to make Avernus an even more hellish place for your particular band of adventurers. Consider using the following methods to customize your party's experience:": "你可以用一些简单的方法来定制冒险，使阿弗纳斯成为你的特定冒险者队伍的一个更可怕的地方。考虑使用以下方法来定制你的队伍的经验。",
	"Learn what scares the characters. At the start of the adventure, ask each player to provide you with a note of three things their character fears. Save these until the party reaches the Nine Hells, then use them to customize the terrors that populate Avernus.": "了解人物害怕的东西。在冒险开始时，要求每个玩家向你提供他们的角色害怕的三样东西的笔记。把这些东西保存起来，直到队伍到达九层地狱，然后用它们来定制阿弗纳斯的恐怖事物。",
	"Keep a list of the flaws that the players selected when they first created their characters, so that you can remind the players of these faults when situations arise to test them. For example, a character with the Folk Hero background might have the flaw, \"I'm quick to assume that someone is trying to cheat me.\" Let the player wrestle with this flaw during negotiations with devils and other denizens of Avernus.": "把玩家在第一次创建角色时选择的缺陷列一个清单，这样，当出现考验玩家的情况时，你就可以提醒他们这些缺陷。例如，一个有民间英雄背景的角色可能有这样的缺陷：\"我很快就会认为有人想欺骗我\"。让玩家在与魔鬼和其他Avernus居民的谈判中与这个缺陷搏斗。",
	"Baldur's Gate began as a harbor town where traders would meet with \"ghost lighters\"—folk along the Sword Coast who used lights to lure fogbound ships to shore. When those ships ran aground, the ghost lighters would scavenge the wrecks and haul their plundered goods to Baldur's Gate, nestled on the north shore of a bend in the River Chionthar, and sell their booty. In the years since, Baldur's Gate has grown into a walled city. Today, its foggy streets run red with the blood of unfortunates who fall prey to evil opportunists, many of whom count themselves as nobles, traders, pirates, and assassins. An army of mercenary soldiers called the Flaming Fist keeps order in the city, and these soldiers answer to Grand Duke {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA}. The members of the Flaming Fist don't care about justice; they crave power and coin, nothing else. But despite the Fist's reputation for cruelty, the Grand Duke is widely regarded as an honorable and reasonable man.": "博德之门最初是一个港口城镇，商人们会在这里与 \"幽灵打火机 \"会面--剑海岸的居民们用灯光引诱雾中的船只靠岸。当这些船搁浅时，幽灵打火机会搜刮残骸，并将他们掠夺的货物拖到博德之门，依偎在基昂萨尔河弯道的北岸，并出售他们的战利品。在此后的岁月里，博德之门已经发展成为一座有围墙的城市。今天，它雾蒙蒙的街道上流淌着不幸者的鲜血，他们是邪恶的机会主义者的猎物，其中许多人把自己当作贵族、商人、海盗和刺客。一支名为 \"火焰之拳 \"的雇佣兵军队维持着城市的秩序，这些士兵向大公爵（%0%）负责。火焰之拳的成员并不关心正义；他们渴望权力和钱财，而不是其他。但是，尽管火焰之拳以残酷著称，大公却被广泛认为是一个可敬和合理的人。",
	"The city of Elturel, capital of Elturgard, is located much farther inland along the River Chionthar. Whereas Baldur's Gate has a well-earned reputation for being a nest of vipers, Elturel is seen as a beacon of faith, order, and high culture. The two cities have endured a long, bitter rivalry that originated when Baldur's Gate began stealing cargo and coin from ships heading to and from Elturel, stifling that city's sea trade. Though the conflicts between Baldur's Gate and Elturel have always fallen short of open warfare, relations between the cities have been tense for a long time—too long, some would say.": "Elturgard的首府Elturel市位于Chionthar河沿岸更远的内陆地区。博德之门因其是一个毒蛇的巢穴而获得了良好的声誉，而Elturel则被视为信仰、秩序和高级文化的灯塔。这两座城市长期以来一直存在着激烈的竞争，起源于博德之门开始从往来Elturel的船上偷取货物和钱币，扼杀了该城市的海上贸易。虽然Baldur's Gate和Elturel之间的冲突一直没有公开的战争，但这两个城市之间的关系已经紧张了很久，有人会说太长了。",
	"A tenday ago, Grand Duke {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA} left Baldur's Gate with a company of Flaming Fist soldiers on a diplomatic mission to Elturel, accepting a formal invitation from Elturel's High Overseer, {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}. Ravengard did not go eagerly, however. It took months of persuasion by his fellow dukes—the other three members of Baldur's Gate's ruling Council of Four—to convince him to accept Elturel's invitation and leave the city in their capable hands. {@creature Duke Thalamra Vanthampur|BGDIA} was especially convincing, having gathered petitions from the nobility as well as leaders of the common rabble.": "一天前，大公爵{@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA}带着一连火焰之拳的士兵离开博德之门，前往艾尔图勒执行外交任务，接受艾尔图勒的高级监督官{@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}的正式邀请。然而，拉文格德并没有急着去。他的同僚公爵们--博德之门执政的四人委员会的其他三位成员花了几个月的时间来说服他接受Elturel的邀请，把城市交给他们来管理。{@creature Duke Thalamra Vanthampur|BGDIA}特别有说服力，他收集了来自贵族以及普通乌合之众领袖的请愿书。",
	"Not long after Ravengard arrived in Elturel, the city was dragged down into the Nine Hells—wiped off the map. Given the distance between the two cities, it's no surprise that the residents of Baldur's Gate didn't hear of Elturel's fate until refugees from Elturgard starting arriving in droves. Rumors concerning Elturel's disappearance spread like wildfire, stoking fears that Baldur's Gate might be next. At the same time, panic swept through the ranks of the Flaming Fist, which suddenly found itself without a strong leader.": "在Ravengard到达Elturel不久，这座城市就被拖入了九层地狱--从地图上抹去了。鉴于两座城市之间的距离，博德之门的居民没有听说Elturel的命运，直到Elturgard的难民开始成群结队地到来，这并不奇怪。有关Elturel失踪的谣言像野火一样蔓延，激起了人们对Baldur's Gate可能是下一个的恐惧。同时，恐慌席卷了火焰之拳的队伍，它突然发现自己没有一个强有力的领导者。",
	"In the grand duke's absence, the government of Baldur's Gate continues to function under the three remaining dukes—Belynne Stelmane, Dillard Portyr, and Thalamra Vanthampur. Duke Portyr has gone so far as to recall his niece, Liara Portyr, from her post as commander of the Flaming Fist at Fort Beluarian in Chult, in the hopes that she can keep the Flaming Fist in check. However, it will take time for her ship to arrive. Meanwhile, refugees from Elturgard continue to arrive with dire claims that nothing remains of Elturel except a crater in the ground.": "在大公不在的情况下，博德之门的政府继续在剩下的三位公爵--斯泰尔曼尼（Belynne Stelmane）、迪拉德-波特尔（Dillard Portyr）和塔拉姆拉-范坦普尔（Thalamra Vanthampur）的领导下运作。波蒂尔公爵甚至把他的侄女利亚拉-波蒂尔从楚尔特的贝卢安堡的火焰之拳指挥官的岗位上召回，希望她能控制住火焰之拳的发展。然而，她的船需要时间才能到达。与此同时，来自Elturgard的难民继续到来，他们可怕地声称Elturel除了地面上的一个大坑外什么都没有留下。",
	"Among those fleeing Elturgard are several Hellriders—paladins who have sworn oaths to defend Elturel. Those warriors escaped the city's fate only because they weren't in Elturel when it fell, and the Flaming Fist has taken to arresting them on sight, lest they try to stir up trouble in Baldur's Gate. The Hellriders are not going quietly, however, leading to violence and bloodshed.": "在那些逃离艾尔图加德的人中，有几个地狱骑士--那些发誓要保卫艾尔图加德的圣骑士。这些战士逃过了城市的命运，只是因为他们在艾尔图勒沦陷时不在那里，而火焰之拳已经采取了当场逮捕他们的做法，以免他们试图在博德之门挑起麻烦。然而，地狱骑士们并没有安静地离开，而是导致了暴力和流血事件。",
	"Without {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA} to stay their hand, Flaming Fist captains are brutally exercising their autonomy under the veneer of maintaining order. They've closed the outer gates to keep Baldur's Gate safe from the refugee \"threat,\" effectively trapping Baldurians behind their own walls. With the Flaming Fist distracted by the refugee crisis, city folk are being hunted and murdered in the streets by cultists of the Dead Three—the evil gods Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul. Without the Flaming Fist to curtail them, these cultists have grown bold and now move freely within the city, their activities financed and supported in secret by {@creature Duke Thalamra Vanthampur|BGDIA}.": "在没有{@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA}留手的情况下，火焰之拳的队长们在维持秩序的外衣下残酷地行使着他们的自主权。他们关闭了外门，以保证博德门免受难民的 \"威胁\"，实际上是把博德门人困在自己的城墙后面。由于火焰之拳被难民危机分散了注意力，城市居民正在被死亡三神--邪恶的Bane、Bhaal和Myrkul的崇拜者在街上追杀。由于没有火焰之拳的遏制，这些邪教分子胆子越来越大，现在在城市里自由活动，他们的活动得到了（1%）的秘密资助和支持。",
	"Among the first refugees to arrive at Baldur's Gate was none other than {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}, the architect of Elturel's doom. Duke Vanthampur is sheltering Kreeg in the dungeon beneath her villa until such time as Baldur's Gate suffers the same fate as Elturel. Like Kreeg, the Vanthampur family is firmly in debt to Zariel, the archdevil of Avernus. Using money purloined from Tiamat's hoard by Zariel's minions on Avernus, Duke Vanthampur hired Dead Three cultists to stir up trouble while her sons stole the {@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA} from a tomb beneath the city. Using the power of this magic shield, Duke Vanthampur and {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA} believe they can bring about the downfall of Baldur's Gate in much the same way the Companion was used against Elturel. The shield binds the essence of a powerful devil named Gargauth, whose presence in Baldur's Gate has fomented much of the evil that lurks in the hearts of the city's residents.": "在第一批到达Baldur's Gate的难民中，正是Elturel厄运的设计者（%0%）。Vanthampur公爵把Kreeg藏在她别墅下面的地牢里，直到Baldur's Gate遭受与Elturel同样的命运。和Kreeg一样，Vanthampur家族对Avernus的大恶魔Zariel也是债台高筑。Vanthampur公爵利用Zariel在Avernus上的爪牙从Tiamat的囤积物中偷来的钱，雇佣了死三的邪教徒来挑起事端，而她的儿子们则从城市下面的墓穴中偷出了（%1%）。利用这个魔法盾牌的力量，范坦普尔公爵和{@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}相信他们可以使博德之门倒台，就像当年用同伴来对付艾尔图勒一样。这面盾牌捆绑了一个名为Gargauth的强大魔鬼的精髓，他在博德之门的存在煽动了许多潜伏在该城市居民心中的邪恶。",
	"To save Baldur's Gate, the adventurers must defeat the Dead Three cultists, track down their evil financiers, wrest the {@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA} from Duke Vanthampur, and pursue Grand Duke {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA} into the Nine Hells.": "为了拯救博德之门，冒险家们必须打败死三教的邪教徒，追踪他们邪恶的资助者，从范坦普尔公爵手中夺取{@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA}，并将大公爵{@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA}追入九幽地狱。",

From their high perches in the Upper City, the local nobles—known as patriars—gaze down with veiled contempt upon the common rabble in the grimy Lower City, which hugs the foggy harbor. The whole of Baldur's Gate reeks of blood, crime, and opportunity. One can easily fathom why pirates and traders are drawn to this place like flies to a carcass.": "欢迎来到博德之门，这是一个名副其实的老鼠和毒蛇的巢穴，依附在俯瞰奇安塔尔河的岩石坡上。在上城的高处，当地的贵族们被称为 \"爱国者\"，他们带着蔑视的眼光俯视着下城的普通乌合之众，下城紧挨着雾气缭绕的港口。整个博德之门充满了血腥、犯罪和机会的味道。人们很容易理解为什么海盗和商人会像苍蝇一样被吸引到这个地方。",
	"Following the river farther east would eventually lead you to Elturel, capital of the holy land of Elturgard—or at least that was the case until a few days ago.

	"The patriars pay a mercenary army called the Flaming Fist to protect their interests in Baldur's Gate, and by extension, the city itself.

If the characters mention Mortlock, Amrik accuses that \"scar-faced hulk\" of consorting with the lowest of the low in Baldur's Gate to bring ruin to their family. Amrik's utter disdain for his younger brother is palpable, though he won't admit to his participation in a conspiracy to assassinate Mortlock. If the characters level accusations against him, Amrik tries to shift the blame to Mortlock.

She watched in disbelief as the Companion's light went out, turning black as the city appeared to crumble and sink below the horizon—a horrific image that Reya has been unable to get out of her mind. She returned to Elturel to find a crater where the city once stood, then took it upon herself to lead a group of fearful refugees west to Baldur's Gate. Before the Flaming Fist closed the city gates, Reya and a handful of others managed to sneak inside, but they didn't get far before a group of Flaming Fist soldiers confronted them. The refugees scattered, and Reya soon found herself cornered by a Flaming Fist thug. She wounded the soldier with her longsword, fled down an alley, and stole a cloak to better conceal her armor and weapons. She's been a wanted fugitive ever since.": "城市消失时，雷亚正在埃尔图勒以北几英里处训练。她难以置信地看着同伴的光芒熄灭，当城市似乎崩溃并沉入地平线以下时，她变成了黑色--这是雷亚一直无法忘怀的恐怖画面。她回到Elturel，发现城市曾经存在的一个火山口，然后自告奋勇地带领一群恐惧的难民向西前往Baldur之门。在火焰之拳关闭城门之前，雷亚和其他少数人设法潜入城内，但他们没走多远就被一群火焰之拳的士兵撞见了。难民们四散而逃，雷亚很快发现自己被一个火焰拳头的暴徒逼到了角落。她用长剑打伤了那个士兵，逃到一条小巷里，并偷了一件斗篷以更好地隐藏她的盔甲和武器。从那时起，她就成了一名被通缉的逃犯。",
	"Reya hasn't been in Baldur's Gate long, but she's quickly concluded that the city is a cesspool of corruption with death lurking around every foggy corner. She's investigating a rumor that {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}, the high overseer of Elturel, is in the city. Reya hasn't confirmed whether the rumor is true, but reports say that Kreeg was seen in the company of four guards employed by the Vanthampur family. The Vanthampur estate is located in the Upper City, beyond her reach, but she has learned that {@creature Amrik Vanthampur|BGDIA} runs a business out of the Low Lantern. She aims to question him about the veracity of the rumor.": "雷亚在博德之门的时间并不长，但她很快就得出结论，这个城市是一个腐败的粪坑，每个雾气弥漫的角落都潜藏着死亡。她正在调查一个谣言，说Elturel的高级监督员{@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}在这个城市里。雷亚还没有证实这个传言是否属实，但有报道说，有人看到克雷格与范坦普尔家族雇佣的四名卫兵在一起。范坦普尔庄园位于上城，超出了她的能力范围，但她了解到{@creature Amrik Vanthampur|BGDIA}在 \"低灯笼 \"外经营着一项业务。她的目的是要询问他这个传言的真实性。",

	"If the characters reveal that they're working for the Flaming Fist, Reya draws her longsword in a panic, expecting to have to defend herself. Characters can allay her fears by saying they have no intention of arresting her. In the interests of full disclosure, Reya admits that she's being hunted by the Flaming Fist for an \"unfortunate altercation\" that wasn't entirely her fault.": "如果人物透露他们在为火焰之拳工作，雷亚就会惊慌失措地拔出长剑，以为要为自己辩护。角色可以通过说他们无意逮捕她来消除她的恐惧。为了全面披露，雷亚承认，她被火焰之拳追捕是因为一次 \"不幸的争吵\"，但这并不完全是她的错。",
	"Reya is willing to join the adventuring party if the characters let her. She has no friends in Baldur's Gate, and she can't reach Vanthampur Villa in the heavily guarded Upper City without help.
