	"Designed for an adventuring party of four to six 1st-level characters, {@i Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus} is a Dungeons & Dragons adventure that begins in the city of Baldur's Gate and ends in Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. By the end of the adventure, the characters should be 13th level or higher. To run this adventure, you need the fifth edition {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, and {@book Monster Manual|MM}.": "专为四到六个一级角色的冒险队伍设计，{@i Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus}是一个龙与地下城的冒险，从博德之门的城市开始，在九层地狱的第一层阿弗纳斯结束。在冒险结束时，人物应该达到13级或更高的水平。要运行这个冒险，你需要第五版（%%1%）、（%%2%）和（%%3%）。",
	"Use the first session of the game to help your players create their 1st-level characters. As part of this process, the players can choose their party's dark secret (see \"{@area Dark Secrets|3ec|x}\").": "利用游戏的第一个环节来帮助你的玩家创建他们的第一级角色。作为这个过程的一部分，玩家可以选择他们党派的黑暗秘密（见\"（%0%）\"）。",
	"The holy city of Elturel has disappeared from the Forgotten Realms and descended into Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. This event came about as the result of an infernal bargain between the archdevil Zariel, who rules Avernus, and the treacherous High Overseer of Elturel, {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}. Zariel is capturing cities and using their citizens as fodder in the ongoing conflict between demons and devils known as the Blood War. Next on Zariel's list of cities is Elturel's neighbor, Baldur's Gate. The characters can be the heroes who descend into Avernus, save Elturel from certain destruction, and prevent a similar fate from befalling Baldur's Gate.": "圣城Elturel已经从被遗忘的领域中消失了，降到了九层地狱的第一层Avernus。这一事件的发生是由于统治阿弗纳斯的大恶魔扎里尔和背叛的艾尔图勒高级监督者（%0%）之间的地狱交易的结果。扎里尔正在占领城市，并在恶魔和魔鬼之间正在进行的被称为血战的冲突中利用他们的公民作为炮灰。在Zariel的城市名单上，下一个是Elturel的邻居Baldur's Gate。这些角色可以成为进入阿弗纳斯（Avernus）的英雄，将Elturel从必然的毁灭中拯救出来，并防止类似的命运降临到Baldur's Gate身上。",
	"{@adventure Chapter 1|BGDIA|1} begins in the independent city of Baldur's Gate, where the characters find themselves trapped behind the city's walls after the gates are sealed to keep out hundreds of refugees from the neighboring land of Elturgard. However, the gates can't hold back news that Elturgard's capital has fallen, and that Grand Duke {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA} of Baldur's Gate is missing—lost on a diplomatic mission to Elturel. The fact that Elturel's misfortune coincided with Ravengard's visit has left Baldurians wondering whether Baldur's Gate will suffer Elturel's fate.": "{@adventure Chapter 1|BGDIA|1}开始于独立城市Baldur's Gate，在那里人物发现自己被困在城墙后面，因为城门被封，以阻止来自邻国Elturgard的数百名难民。然而，城门无法阻挡Elturgard的首都已经沦陷的消息，Baldur's Gate的大公爵（%1%）失踪了--在前往Elturel的外交任务中失踪。Elturel的不幸与Ravengard的访问同时发生，这让Baldur人怀疑Baldur's Gate是否会遭受Elturel的命运。",
	"The characters are drafted by the Flaming Fist, the army of mercenaries tasked with protecting Baldur's Gate. Without Grand Duke {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA} to lead them, the Flaming Fist mercenaries are little more than glorified thugs. The characters' orders are to help maintain peace by rooting out and destroying followers of Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul—evil gods collectively known as the Dead Three. These vile priests, assassins, and necromancers are murdering city folk at random, and the Flaming Fist is too distracted and disorganized to hunt them down and find their lair. In the course of their investigation, the characters learn that the Dead Three cultists are secretly being financed by Thalamra Vanthampur, one of three remaining dukes who preside over the government of Baldur's Gate, using money stolen from the hoard of Tiamat, the evil queen of dragons imprisoned in the Nine Hells.": "这些人物是由火焰之拳征召的，这是一支负责保护博德之门的雇佣军。没有大公{@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA}的领导，火焰之拳的雇佣兵们不过是些光荣的打手。他们的任务是帮助维持和平，铲除并摧毁贝恩、巴哈和米尔库尔的追随者--这些邪恶的神灵统称为 \"死亡三人组\"。这些卑鄙的牧师、刺客和死灵法师正在随意谋杀城市居民，而火焰之拳分心且无组织，无法追捕他们并找到他们的巢穴。在调查过程中，角色们了解到，死灵三教派是由主持博德之门政府的三位剩余公爵之一的塔拉姆拉-范坦普尔秘密资助的，资金来自于被囚禁在九层地狱的邪恶龙后提亚马特的仓库。",
	"With Grand Duke {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA} out of the way, Thalamra is paying the Dead Three to shatter confidence in the Flaming Fist so that all payments to the decapitated organization can be cut off. Thalamra, a devout disciple of the archdevil Zariel, has brokered a deal that will enable her to claim the role of grand duke once the Flaming Fist disbands, paving the way for the city's descent into Avernus. To accomplish this last goal, Thalamra needs an artifact called the {@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA}, imprisoned in which is a pit fiend named Gargauth. Until recently, the shield was sealed in a tomb under the city, but Thalamra's sons recently stole it and transported it to the dungeon below their villa. So corrupt is the shield that its mere presence in Baldur's Gate has contributed to the city's moral decay for decades.": "随着大公（%0%）的出局，塔拉姆拉正在付钱给死亡三人组，以粉碎对火焰之拳的信心，这样就可以切断对这个被斩首组织的所有付款。塔拉姆拉是大恶魔扎里尔的虔诚弟子，她促成了一项交易，一旦火焰之拳解散，她就能要求担任大公爵的角色，为城市沦为阿弗纳斯铺平道路。为了实现这最后一个目标，萨拉姆拉需要一件名为{@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA}的神器，里面囚禁着一个名叫加加斯的坑道恶魔。直到最近，这面盾牌还被封存在城市下的一座坟墓里，但萨拉姆拉的儿子们最近偷走了它，并把它运到他们别墅下面的地牢里。这面盾牌是如此腐败，以至于它在博德之门的存在就导致了这个城市几十年来的道德败坏。",
	"To keep Baldur's Gate from falling into Zariel's clutches, the characters must take the shield far away from the city. Reya Mantlemorn, a young knight from Elturel, suspects that the Vanthampurs are sheltering {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA} at their estate and offers aid. Characters who storm Duke Vanthampur's villa find Thavius hidden in the dungeon below it. Thavius is helping Thalamra Vanthampur use the {@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA} to bring about the fall of Baldur's Gate, in much the same fashion he used the Companion (see \"{@area The Companion|007|x}\") to doom Elturel. If the characters slay Thavius, his soul travels to the Nine Hells and re-forms as an amnizu devil on Avernus (see \"\"{@area Poor Devil: Thavius Kreeg|2b8|x}\").": "为了不让博德之门落入扎里尔的魔掌，人物必须把盾牌带到远离城市的地方。来自Elturel的年轻骑士Reya Mantlemorn怀疑Vanthampur公爵在他们的庄园里避难{@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}，并提供了援助。冲进范坦普尔公爵别墅的人物发现塔维乌斯藏在别墅下面的地牢里。Thavius正在帮助Thalamra Vanthampur使用{@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA}来实现Baldur's Gate的衰落，这与他使用同伴（见\"{@area The Companion|007|x}\"）来毁灭Elturel的方式很相似。如果人物杀死了塔维乌斯，他的灵魂就会前往九层地狱，并在阿弗纳斯重新形成一个无主的魔鬼（见\"\"{@area Poor Devil: Thavius Kreeg|2b8|x}\"）。",
	"In the course of dealing with {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA} and the Vanthampur family, characters are likely to acquire the {@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA} as well as an {@item infernal puzzle box|BGDIA} that they can't open. They might also liberate a spy imprisoned in Duke Vanthampur's dungeon who works for {@creature Sylvira Savikas|BGDIA}, a tiefling expert on the Nine Hells. Determined to thwart devil worshipers in positions of power throughout the Western Heartlands, Sylvira operates out of the library of Candlekeep and has spent years monitoring devil activity in Baldur's Gate, Elturel, and the surrounding region. Her spies are after the puzzle box, which is believed to contain a copy of the fiendish contract Thavius signed to seal Elturel's doom.": "在与{@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}和Vanthampur家族打交道的过程中，人物有可能获得{@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA}以及一个他们无法打开的{@item infernal puzzle box|BGDIA}。他们还可能解放一个被囚禁在Vanthampur公爵地牢里的间谍，他为{@creature Sylvira Savikas|BGDIA}工作，一个研究九层地狱的铁皮人专家。西尔维拉决心挫败在整个西部心脏地带身居要职的魔鬼崇拜者，她在烛光之城的图书馆工作，并花了数年时间监视恶魔在博德之门、埃尔图勒以及周边地区的活动。她的间谍们正在寻找谜盒，据说里面有一份塔维斯签署的封印艾尔图勒厄运的恶魔契约的副本。",
	"If the characters wish to help Baldur's Gate further, they must journey to the Nine Hells and rescue {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA} from what's left of Elturel. The characters are urged to seek out {@creature Sylvira Savikas|BGDIA} in Candlekeep. Sylvira knows the secret to unlocking Thavius's puzzle box. She can also facilitate the characters' descent into Avernus and provide them with a map (albeit an unreliable one). Sylvira advises characters to leave the {@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA} in her custody. However, there are benefits to taking the shield with them, for Gargauth can guide them through the Nine Hells in ways others cannot. With or without the shield, the characters depart Candlekeep and visit Sylvira's friend, {@creature Traxigor|BGDIA}, a wizard who can use the {@spell plane shift} spell to get them to Elturel. At this wizard's tower, they meet a {@creature hollyphant|BGDIA} named {@creature Lulu|BGDIA}.": "如果角色希望进一步帮助博德之门，他们必须前往九层地狱，并从Elturel剩下的地方救出（%0%）。角色们被敦促在Candlekeep寻找（%1%）。西尔维拉知道解开塔维乌斯谜盒的秘密。她还可以帮助人物进入阿弗纳斯，并为他们提供一张地图（尽管是一张不可靠的地图）。西尔维拉建议人物把{@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA}交给她保管。然而，带着盾牌也有好处，因为加尔古斯能以其他人无法做到的方式引导他们穿越九层地狱。不管有没有盾牌，人物都要离开烛台镇，去拜访希尔维拉的朋友{@creature Traxigor|BGDIA}，一个可以使用{@spell plane shift}法术让他们去艾尔图勒的巫师。在这个巫师的塔里，他们遇到了一个名叫（%5%）的（%6%）。",
	"{@adventure Chapter 2|BGDIA|2} opens with the characters' arrival in Elturel, which is anchored by enormous chains and trapped under the baleful light of the Companion. If the characters do nothing, the city will be pulled down into the River Styx and bound to the Nine Hells forever. {@creature Lulu|BGDIA} tries her best to serve as the party's guide in Avernus, but the hollyphant's memories are fragmented. It becomes clear, however, that {@creature Lulu|BGDIA} has a personal connection to Zariel, dating back to the archdevil's former angelic existence.": "{@adventure Chapter 2|BGDIA|2}以人物到达Elturel开始，Elturel被巨大的锁链固定住，并被困在同伴的邪恶之光下。如果人物什么都不做，这座城市就会被拉到冥河里，永远被束缚在九幽地狱里。{@creature Lulu|BGDIA}尽力充当党在阿弗纳斯的向导，但冬青象的记忆已经支离破碎。然而，很明显，（2%）与扎里尔有个人联系，可以追溯到大恶魔以前的天使存在。",
	"After scouring Elturel for survivors and clashing with the denizens of Avernus, the characters encounter the valiant {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA}, who has been placed in the most unusual situation of defending a city he has long opposed. The beleaguered Ravengard urges the characters to do whatever they can to free Elturel and return what's left of it to Faerûn. To do so, they must scour Avernus for the means to destroy the Companion or break the enormous chains that shackle that city, as described in {@adventure chapter 3|BGDIA|3}.": "在搜寻Elturel的幸存者并与Avernus的居民发生冲突后，人物遇到了英勇的{@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA}，他被置于最不寻常的境地，保卫他长期反对的城市。陷入困境的拉文加德敦促角色们尽一切可能解放艾尔图勒，并将它剩下的东西归还给法鲁恩。要做到这一点，他们必须在Avernus寻找摧毁同伴或打破束缚该城市的巨大枷锁的方法，如{@adventure chapter 3|BGDIA|3}中所述。",
	"Avernus has long been a battlefield in the never-ending Blood War. Apart from clashing demons and devils, petty warlords scour the Avernian wastelands in search of treasure, salvage, and fuel for their infernal war machines. Characters who forge an alliance with one warlord risk alienating the others. By acquiring an infernal war machine, characters can travel quickly across Avernus—a domain rife with tortured souls, warmongers, and devils eager to tempt would-be heroes into soul-corrupting deals.": "长期以来，Avernus一直是永无止境的血战中的战场。除了恶魔和魔鬼的冲突之外，小军阀们还在阿维尼亚的荒原上寻找宝藏、残余物和他们的地狱战争机器的燃料。与一个军阀结盟的角色有可能疏远其他军阀。通过获得一台地狱战争机器，角色可以快速穿越阿弗纳斯--一个充斥着受折磨的灵魂、战争贩子和渴望诱惑未来的英雄进行灵魂腐蚀交易的恶魔的领域。",
	"The more time she spends with the characters, the more {@creature Lulu|BGDIA} begins to remember long-lost memories of the {@item Sword of Zariel|BGDIA}, an angelic weapon with the power to destroy the Companion. After Zariel's fall from grace, the sword was hidden in a stronghold called the Bleeding Citadel—a celestial sanctuary trapped in Avernus. The quest for the sword forms the crux of {@adventure chapter 4|BGDIA|7}, leading to the revelation that Zariel can be redeemed.": "她与这些人物相处的时间越长，{@creature Lulu|BGDIA}就越是开始回忆起久违的记忆，{@item Sword of Zariel|BGDIA}是一把具有摧毁同伴力量的天使武器。在扎里尔堕落之后，这把剑被藏在一个叫做 \"流血堡垒 \"的据点里--一个被困在阿弗纳斯的天体圣地。对这把剑的探索构成了{@adventure chapter 4|BGDIA|7}的关键，导致了扎里尔可以被救赎的启示。",
	"The characters' success doesn't hinge on acquiring the {@item Sword of Zariel|BGDIA} or helping Zariel find redemption, as Gargauth is quick to point out should the characters consult with him. There are other ways to free Elturel, but only if the characters are willing to cut deals with Avernus's most evil denizens. The characters might broker a deal with the deposed archdevil {@creature Bel|BGDIA}, who longs to supplant Zariel and regain his title as ruler of Avernus. They might stoke the rage of a horrific demon called {@creature Crokek'toeck|BGDIA} and trick it into gnawing through Elturel's chains. They might come to terms with an evil dragonborn paladin named {@creature Arkhan the Cruel|BGDIA}, using him to broker a deal with Tiamat. By returning her stolen treasure, characters can convince Tiamat to break Elturel's chains.": "人物的成功并不取决于获得{@item Sword of Zariel|BGDIA}或帮助Zariel找到救赎，因为如果人物向他咨询，Gargauth会很快指出。还有其他方法可以解救Elturel，但前提是角色们愿意与Avernus最邪恶的居民进行交易。角色们可能会与被废黜的大恶魔（%1%）进行交易，他渴望取代扎里尔，重新获得他作为阿弗纳斯统治者的称号。他们可能会激起一个叫做（%2%）的可怕恶魔的愤怒，并欺骗它咬断Elturel的链子。他们可能会与一个名叫（%3%）的邪恶龙裔圣骑士达成协议，利用他来促成与提亚马特的交易。通过归还她偷来的财宝，人物可以说服提亚马特打破Elturel的锁链。",
	"As tempting as such pursuits can be, the characters must be careful, for devil deals, demon lords, and Tiamat's rage number among the multiverse's greatest threats. Also, Zariel herself might become cross with the characters for daring to meddle in her diabolical affairs. How the adventure concludes depends on the choices the characters make, the chaos they foment, and the deals they forge, as discussed in {@adventure chapter 5|BGDIA|8}.": "尽管这种追求很诱人，但人物必须小心，因为魔鬼交易、恶魔领主和提亚马特的愤怒都是多元宇宙的最大威胁。另外，扎里尔本人也可能因为敢于插手她的邪恶事务而与角色发生冲突。冒险如何结束取决于人物的选择、他们煽动的混乱和他们达成的交易，如{@adventure chapter 5|BGDIA|8}所述。",
	"On the plane of Mount Celestia, the angel Zariel chastised her peers for not getting involved in the Blood War. She felt that it was the responsibility of the angelic host to destroy evil in the multiverse, rather than stand back and watch demons and devils annihilate one another, destroying vast swaths of the multiverse in the process. In defiance of her superiors, Zariel left Mount Celestia and went to Elturel, where she rallied an army of warriors and trained them to fight in the Blood War. She promised them that when they were ready, she would lead them into battle on Avernus.": "在天龙山上，天使扎丽尔责备她的同龄人没有参与到血战中。她觉得天使的责任是在多元宇宙中消灭邪恶，而不是站在后面看着恶魔和魔鬼互相消灭，在这个过程中摧毁大片的多元宇宙。为了反抗她的上级，扎丽尔离开了天龙山，去了Elturel，在那里她召集了一支战士的军队，训练他们参加血战。她向他们承诺，当他们准备好时，她将带领他们在阿弗纳斯作战。",
	"Zariel led her army out of Elturel amid a throng of cheering well-wishers and proud citizens in 1354 DR. In an epic charge known as the Ride, Zariel's army entered Avernus and took the fight to the archdevil {@creature Bel|BGDIA} and his infernal legions. Many of Zariel's warriors fought bravely, but for others, the horrors of the Nine Hells proved too great. They fled back through the portal, sealing it behind them and never revealing their shameful retreat and betrayal. The Hellriders, as they were called, would wear this badge of shame to the grave.": "1354年，扎丽尔率领她的军队在一众欢呼的祝福者和自豪的公民中离开了艾尔图勒。在一次史诗般的冲锋中，扎丽尔的军队进入了阿弗纳斯，与大恶魔（%0%）和他的地狱军团展开了战斗。许多扎里尔的战士英勇奋战，但对其他人来说，九层地狱的恐怖被证明是过于巨大的。他们从传送门逃了回来，把它封在身后，从不透露他们无耻的撤退和背叛。他们被称为 \"地狱骑士\"，他们将带着这个耻辱的徽章进入坟墓。",
	"Zariel lost more than her army on Avernus. She also lost a hand, which was severed in battle. As her sword fell to the ground, Zariel ordered Yael, her most devoted general, to take the weapon and hide it, so that the devils would not destroy or corrupt it. Yael took the sword and fled, along with Zariel's faithful hollyphant companion, {@creature Lulu|BGDIA}. Zariel's other two generals, Olanthius and Haruman, refused to leave Zariel's side. All three were captured and sent to Nessus, the lowest of the Nine Hells. There, Zariel was brought before Asmodeus, who welcomed her with open arms. The Lord of the Nine commended Zariel for her battle prowess and the strength of her convictions. He offered her rulership of Avernus, much to {@creature Bel|BGDIA}'s chagrin. By swearing fealty to Asmodeus and the Nine Hells, Zariel could bring her rage to bear against the demons and continue to fight in the Blood War, with legions of devils under her command. Zariel accepted Asmodeus's terms, completing her fall from grace. Haruman followed his master into damnation willingly and was transformed into a narzugon devil, while Olanthius, who took his own life rather than bow before Asmodeus, was brought back to serve as a death knight under Zariel's burning gaze.": "扎里尔在阿弗纳斯失去的不仅仅是她的军队。她还失去了一只手，这只手在战斗中被切断了。当她的剑掉在地上时，扎丽尔命令她最忠诚的将军雅尔拿着武器藏起来，这样魔鬼就不会破坏或腐蚀它了。雅儿拿着剑，和扎丽尔忠实的冬青象伙伴（%0%）一起逃走了。扎里尔的另外两个将军，奥兰修斯和哈鲁曼，拒绝离开扎里尔的身边。这三个人都被俘虏了，并被送往九层地狱中最低的内瑟斯。在那里，扎丽尔被带到阿斯莫德面前，他张开双臂欢迎她。九幽之主赞扬了扎丽尔的战斗力和她信念的力量。他为她提供了Avernus的统治权，这让(1%)的人感到非常懊恼。通过向阿斯莫德和九层地狱宣誓效忠，扎丽尔可以带着她的愤怒去对抗恶魔，继续在血战中战斗，并在她的指挥下组成恶魔军团。扎丽尔接受了阿斯莫德的条件，完成了她的陨落。哈鲁曼心甘情愿地跟随他的主人进入了地狱，并被转化为一个纳尔苏贡魔鬼，而奥兰修斯宁可自杀也不愿在阿斯莫德面前低头，他被带回来在扎丽尔灼热的目光下作为死亡骑士服务。",
	"Zariel never forgot her betrayers—those who ran from the battlefield. She kept a close eye on Elturel, waiting for the day when she could enact her revenge. That day came in 1444 DR, when Elturel was conquered by a vampire lord. A priest of Torm named {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA} appealed to any power to help him save his holy city. In that instant, Zariel emerged from a pillar of fire and offered him a deal, which Thavius readily accepted.": "扎里尔从未忘记她的背叛者--那些从战场上逃跑的人。她一直密切关注着Elturel，等待着有一天她可以实施她的复仇。这一天在公元1444年到来，Elturel被一个吸血鬼领主征服了。一位名叫{@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}的托尔姆的牧师呼吁任何力量帮助他拯救他的圣城。在那一瞬间，扎里尔从火柱中出现，向他提出了一个交易，塔维乌斯欣然接受。",
	"In the sky over Elturel, a radiant sphere called the Companion appeared, blazing like a second sun. Powered by a planetar imprisoned within it, the Companion bathed Elturel and the surrounding countryside in holy light which sent the vampire lord scrambling for the shadows and laid waste to his undead army. {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}, who took credit for summoning the Companion, was hailed as the savior of the city and rose to become its high overseer. Under Kreeg's decades-long rule, Elturel embarked on a path to becoming not just a holy city but the holy nation of Elturgard.": "在Elturel的上空，出现了一个被称为 \"同伴 \"的光芒四射的球体，像第二个太阳一样炽热。在一个被囚禁在其中的行星体的驱动下，同伴使艾尔图勒和周围的乡村沐浴在圣光之中，这让吸血鬼领主慌忙躲进阴影中，并浪费了他的亡灵军队。{@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}将召唤同伴的功劳归功于他，他被誉为城市的救世主，并升为城市的最高监督者。在克雷格数十年的统治下，埃尔图勒走上了一条道路，不仅成为了圣城，而且成为了埃尔图加德的圣国。",
	"Thavius was told the exact time when the Companion would cease to protect Elturel. In the weeks leading up to this fateful hour, Thavius urged Grand Duke {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA} of Baldur's Gate to visit Elturel, to help settle some longstanding disputes between the two cities. Facing political pressure at home, Ravengard reluctantly acceded. After greeting Ravengard's delegation, {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA} fled Elturel in secret and watched from a safe distance as the Companion transformed from a radiant sun into a black orb awash with crackling energy. It ripped Elturel from the Material Plane, transporting it and all its inhabitants to Avernus. A few other city folk managed to escape before Elturel disappeared. Where it once stood, only a crater remains.": "塔维乌斯被告知同伴将停止保护Elturel的确切时间。在这个决定性时刻到来之前的几周，塔维乌斯敦促博德之门的大公爵（%0%）访问Elturel，以帮助解决两个城市之间一些长期的争端。面对国内的政治压力，拉文加德不情愿地答应了。在迎接了拉文加德的代表团后，(1%)秘密地逃离了Elturel，并在安全距离上看着同伴从一个光芒四射的太阳变成了一个充斥着噼里啪啦能量的黑色球体。它把Elturel从物质世界中剥离出来，把它和它所有的居民都运到了Avernus。在Elturel消失之前，还有一些城市居民设法逃脱。它曾经站立的地方，只剩下一个火山口。",
	"Disguised as a refugee, {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA} was one of the first of his people to arrive at Baldur's Gate with news of Elturel's \"destruction.\" He slipped through the city's gates with the help of his influential friend, Duke Vanthampur, and took refuge in her home.": "伪装成一个难民，{@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}是他的族人中最早到达Baldur's Gate的Elturel \"毁灭 \"的消息之一。他在他有影响力的朋友Vanthampur公爵的帮助下溜进了城门，并在她家避难。",
	"As the DM, you can play devils as humorous, aloof, bombastic, conniving, or scatterbrained, but a general rule to follow is this: devils have no desire to do good. When dealing with mortals, devils are constantly figuring out how to exploit and corrupt them, often behind thin smiles of feigned concern and false charm.": "作为管理者，你可以把魔鬼扮演成幽默的、冷漠的、狂轰滥炸的、纵容的、或散漫的，但要遵循的一般规则是：魔鬼没有做好事的欲望。在与凡人打交道时，魔鬼不断地想出如何利用和腐蚀他们，往往是在假装关心和虚假魅力的薄薄的笑容背后。",
	"A devil that successfully corrupts a mortal gets the infernal equivalent of a gold star and can eagerly expect a superior to take notice and give it the promotion it so richly deserves. Meanwhile, when that mortal dies, its soul will find itself condemned to the Nine Hells where it twists into the form of a {@creature lemure} (unless it's used for some other morbid purpose). The devil doesn't care what becomes of the souls it corrupts; it just wants to be promoted to a superior form of devil. That's how, over ages, a {@creature lemure} might become a {@creature pit fiend}.": "一个成功腐蚀凡人的魔鬼会得到相当于一颗金星的地狱勋章，并急切地期望上级注意到它，给它以应有的晋升。同时，当那个凡人死后，它的灵魂会发现自己被判处到九层地狱，在那里它被扭曲成（%0%）的形式（除非它被用于其他病态的目的）。魔鬼并不关心它所腐蚀的灵魂会变成什么；它只想晋升为更高级的魔鬼形式。这就是为什么随着时间的推移，一个（1%）可能会变成一个（2%）。",
	"But devils do more than corrupt. They also fight in the Blood War. Asmodeus attests that serving in his infernal legion is a holy honor, for in so doing a devil helps protect the multiverse from demonic destruction. While that sounds impressive, most devils partake in the Blood War only to distinguish themselves among their peers and move up the chain of command. Endlessly fighting demons isn't what most devils signed up for.": "但魔鬼不仅仅是贪污。他们也在血战中战斗。阿斯莫德（Asmodeus）证明，在他的地狱军团中服役是一种神圣的荣誉，因为这样做的话，魔鬼可以帮助保护多元宇宙免受恶魔的破坏。虽然这听起来令人印象深刻，但大多数魔鬼参加血战只是为了在他们的同龄人中脱颖而出，并在指挥系统中获得晋升。无休止地与恶魔战斗并不是大多数魔鬼的目的。",
	"If a devil dies somewhere other than the Nine Hells, it re-forms in the Nine Hells and is therefore not truly killed. However, a devil that is killed in the Nine Hells is dead forever; not surprisingly, that's why devils tend to be more cautious in their dealings at home than abroad.": "如果一个魔鬼在九层地狱以外的地方死亡，它会在九层地狱重新形成，因此并没有真正被杀死。然而，在九层地狱被杀的魔鬼就会永远死去；这并不奇怪，这就是为什么魔鬼在国内的交易往往比国外更加谨慎。",
	"This adventure features the Nine Hells, which is described in {@book chapter 2|DMG|2|The Nine Hells} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}. Devils, being the primary inhabitants of the Nine Hells, play prominent roles in this story. Before running the adventure, it's worth taking the time to familiarize yourself with the \"Devils\" entry in the {@book Monster Manual|MM}, which not only describes the most common types of devils but also explains their hierarchy, how they behave in accordance with their lawful evil alignment, what pleases and enrages them, and why they're scared of dying on their home plane.": "这个冒险故事的特点是九层地狱，这在{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}的{@book chapter 2|DMG|2|The Nine Hells}中有所描述。魔鬼是九层地狱的主要居民，在这个故事中扮演着重要角色。在进行冒险之前，值得花时间熟悉一下{@book Monster Manual|MM}中的 \"魔鬼 \"条目，它不仅描述了最常见的魔鬼类型，还解释了它们的等级制度，它们如何按照合法的邪恶路线行事，什么会让它们高兴和愤怒，以及它们为什么害怕在自己的母体上死亡。",

	"Common traits among devils include the following:": "魔鬼的共同特征包括以下几点。",
	"{@b Charm}. Devils are consummate charmers. Like humans, some are better at it than others. The good ones savor the exchange of pleasantries, speaking in measured sentences or noticing pleasant details about the environment or a character's clothing.": "{@b Charm}. 魔鬼是完美的魅惑者。像人类一样，有些人比其他人更善于此道。优秀的人喜欢寒暄，用有分寸的句子说话，或注意到环境或人物服装的愉快细节。",
	"{@b Patience}. Devils are rarely in a rush to make a deal or sign a contract. As masters of the long con, devils make genuinely good deals with mortals to buy appreciation and trust that can be leveraged during more consequential dealings later on.": "{@b Patience}. 魔鬼们很少急于做交易或签合同。作为长期骗局的大师，魔鬼与凡人做真正的好交易，以购买赞赏和信任，这可以在以后更重要的交易中得到利用。",
	"{@b Civility}. Devils like to pretend that they run by the same rules and obey the same social conventions as mortals. Devils have no problem appearing and acting in whatever manner they need to achieve their end goal—usually a contract for services or a soul. They've learned that more can be gained from behaving in a civilized manner than reacting angrily or violently.": "{@b Civility}. 魔鬼喜欢假装他们和凡人一样遵循同样的规则，遵守同样的社会习俗。魔鬼以任何方式出现和行动都没有问题，他们需要实现他们的最终目标--通常是服务合同或灵魂。他们已经知道，与愤怒或暴力反应相比，以文明的方式行事可以获得更多好处。",
	"{@b Deviousness}. Devils don't age, so there's rarely a sense of urgency with a devil as it plots its conquest or corruption of a soul. This allows for winding schemes that are rarely what they seem on the surface. For minor devils, a simple acceptance of an evil gift is enough, while greater devils enjoy tangling up characters in choices that compromise their values.": "{@b Deviousness}. 魔鬼不会变老，所以当它策划征服或腐蚀一个灵魂时，很少有紧迫感。这就使得曲折的计划很少是表面上看起来的那样。对于小恶魔来说，简单地接受一个邪恶的礼物就足够了，而大恶魔则喜欢在损害其价值观的选择中纠缠角色。",
	"{@b Unscrupulousness}. Being evil and soulless, a devil cannot be embarrassed or shamed, doesn't feel guilt or remorse, and is prepared to do the most heinous acts to get what it wants.": "{@b Unscrupulousness}. 由于邪恶和没有灵魂，魔鬼不会感到尴尬或羞耻，不会感到内疚或悔恨，并准备做最令人发指的行为来获得它想要的东西。",
	"{@b Fear of Demotion}. A devil that disappoints a superior can be demoted, whereupon it's instantly transformed into a lesser form of devil. The greater the devil, the more it fears demotion and the loss of its power. Thus, a devil takes great pains to hide its failures or pin them on someone else.": "{@b Fear of Demotion}. 一个让上司失望的魔鬼可以被降级，这时它就会立刻变成一个较低级的魔鬼。越是伟大的魔鬼，越是害怕降级和失去权力。因此，魔鬼会不遗余力地隐藏自己的失败，或将其归咎于别人。",
	"Much of the adventure takes place on the first layer of the Nine Hells. This is not, to put it mildly, your run-of-the-mill D&D setting. The following tips and tricks can help you make the characters' stay in Avernus a remarkable one.": "冒险的大部分内容发生在九层地狱的第一层。可以说，这不是你的普通的D&D环境。下面的提示和技巧可以帮助你使人物在阿弗纳斯的逗留变得与众不同。",
	"The Nine Hells is a place of abject misery where no one is happy. Weaker devils are exploited and tormented by their superiors. Stronger devils live in constant fear of being passed over for promotion or demoted. Even when something seems to go right, joy is fleeting and only fuels suspicion that things are about to get much worse. Such inescapable pessimism leads many creatures to become apathetic and spiteful. They take perverse delight in spreading their unhappiness like a contagion.": "九层地狱是一个赤裸裸的苦难之地，没有人是幸福的。弱小的魔鬼被他们的上级剥削和折磨。强壮的魔鬼生活在不断的恐惧中，害怕被提拔或降级。即使有什么事情似乎是正确的，快乐也是转瞬即逝的，而且只会助长对事情即将变得更加糟糕的怀疑。这种不可避免的悲观主义导致许多生物变得冷漠和充满怨恨。他们反常地喜欢像传染病一样传播他们的不快乐。",
	"You can remind players that the Nine Hells is a place of misery and suffering in the following ways:": "你可以通过以下方式提醒玩家，九层地狱是一个苦难的地方。",
	"In conversations with the characters, natives of the Nine Hells like to bemoan their misfortune and blame others for their horrible lives.": "在与人物的对话中，九层地狱的当地人喜欢哀叹他们的不幸，并将他们可怕的生活归咎于他人。",
	"When a character accomplishes something, you can undercut that success in some small way. For example, the character's belt might snap, or a hellish insect might sting the character on the neck and leave a welt.": "当一个角色完成了某件事情时，你可以用一些小方法来削弱这种成功。例如，这个人物的腰带可能会断裂，或者一只地狱般的昆虫可能会刺伤这个人物的脖子并留下一道伤痕。",
	"If a character rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll made with a nonmagical weapon, you can decide that the weapon breaks.": "如果一个角色在用非魔法武器进行的攻击卷上掷出自然的1，你可以决定该武器破裂。",
	"Avernus is insidious in the way it fosters greed and makes visitors pay or barter for the things they need to survive. Most of the wildlife on Avernus is not edible to mortals, and most sources of water are poisonous or otherwise tainted. The rarity of edible food and drinkable water encourages hoarding behavior.": "Avernus的阴险之处在于它助长了贪婪，让游客为生存所需的东西付出代价或进行交易。Avernus上的大多数野生动物对凡人来说都是不可食用的，大多数水源都是有毒的或被污染的。可食用的食物和可饮用的水的稀有性鼓励了囤积行为。",
	"You can remind players about the awfulness of Avernus in the following ways:": "你可以通过以下方式提醒玩家阿弗纳斯的可怕之处。",
	"Any food or drink the characters bring with them or conjure by magic retains its nutritional value but tastes awful when eaten or imbibed on Avernus. The food tastes like ash, the water tastes like bile, and the wine tastes like spoiled milk.": "角色们带来的或用魔法变出的任何食物或饮料都保留了其营养价值，但在Avernus上吃或喝的时候味道很糟糕。食物的味道像灰，水的味道像胆汁，酒的味道像变质的牛奶。",
	"If the characters want something that tastes good, they must buy it from licensed sellers such as {@creature Mahadi the rakshasa|BGDIA}, who runs a restaurant called Infernal Rapture (see \"{@area Infernal Rapture|2a1|x}\"). The price of a good-tasting meal is always a bit too high.": "如果人物想吃好吃的东西，他们必须从有执照的卖家那里买，比如{@creature Mahadi the rakshasa|BGDIA}，他经营着一家叫 \"无间狂欢 \"的餐厅（见\"{@area Infernal Rapture|2a1|x}\"）。味道好的饭菜的价格总是有点太高。",
	"If a character commits a selfish act, you can reward that selfishness by granting that character inspiration (as described in {@book chapter 4|PHB|4|Inspiration} of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}). Unlike regular inspiration, the benefit can't be transferred to another creature.": "如果一个角色做出了自私的行为，你可以通过授予该角色灵感来奖励这种自私的行为（如{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}的{@book chapter 4|PHB|4|Inspiration}所述）。与普通的灵感不同，这种好处不能转移给另一个生物。",
	"Before the Blood War reduced it to a blasted wasteland, Avernus was a honey trap created by Asmodeus, a paradise of infinite delights designed to lure and enrapture mortals. Fragments of this lost paradise still plunge from Avernus's sky as burning meteors, and the land is dotted with the ruins of palaces and idyllic gardens that were obscenely beautiful in eons past.": "在血战将其变成一片废墟之前，阿弗纳斯是阿斯莫德创造的一个蜂蜜陷阱，一个充满无限乐趣的天堂，旨在引诱和迷惑凡人。这个失落的天堂的碎片仍然像燃烧的流星一样从阿弗纳斯的天空坠落，这片土地上遍布着宫殿和田园的废墟，在过去的岁月里，这些宫殿和田园是非常美丽的。",
	"Fleeting reminders of this ancient paradise can come to the characters in the following ways:": "对这个古老的天堂的短暂提醒可以通过以下方式出现在人物身上。",
	"While traveling across Avernus, the characters glimpse a fantastic mirage: a grand palace or garden oasis that vanishes when they get within 100 feet of it.": "在穿越Avernus时，人物瞥见了一个奇妙的海市蜃楼：一个宏伟的宫殿或花园绿洲，当他们进入100英尺范围内就会消失。",
	"A random character hears beautiful music or laughter, catches the scent of flowers or perfume, or experiences a gentle caress. The sensation has no discernible source and fades after a few moments.": "一个随机的角色听到了美妙的音乐或笑声，闻到了花香或香水的味道，或者经历了温柔的爱抚。这种感觉没有明显的来源，片刻之后就会消失。",
	"The characters find a relic that survived the fall of paradise, such as a beautiful vase or toppled statue. The first character to touch the relic experiences a fleeting moment of pure joy.": "角色们找到了在天堂沦陷中幸存下来的遗物，比如一个美丽的花瓶或被推翻的雕像。第一个触摸到遗迹的人物会体验到短暂的纯粹的快乐。",
	"Geography warps at the whims of the Nine Hells. One of the liberating aspects of this planar feature is that you don't need to be fastidious about keeping track of where locations are in relation to one another.": "地理环境随九层地狱的变化而变化。这种平面特征的一个自由方面是，你不需要快速跟踪地点之间的关系。",
	"While the spatial distortion can be unsettling to visitors, it affords you the following benefits as a DM:": "虽然空间上的扭曲会让游客感到不安，但作为DM，它为你带来了以下好处。",
	"You can decide how long it takes for characters to get from one place to the next. For example, the characters might need to travel 6 miles to get from Fort Knucklebone to Haruman's Hill, and 60 miles to get from Haruman's Hill back to Fort Knucklebone.": "你可以决定人物从一个地方到下一个地方需要多长时间。例如，人物可能需要走6英里才能从克努克勒本堡到哈鲁曼山，而从哈鲁曼山回到克努克勒本堡需要60英里。",
	"If the characters are in a rush to get somewhere, an {@creature imp} could appear out of nowhere and, for the price of a {@item soul coin|BGDIA} or other valuable item, show them a shortcut that halves the distance the characters must travel to reach their destination.": "如果人物急于去某个地方，一个{@creature imp}可以突然出现，并以{@item soul coin|BGDIA}或其他有价值的物品为代价，向他们展示一条捷径，使人物到达目的地的距离减半。",
	"The Wandering Emporium (see \"{@area The Wandering Emporium|297|x}\") can show up almost anywhere in the Nine Hells, at any time. If the players don't know where to go or what to do next, or if you want to surprise them with fun roleplaying opportunities, have the Wandering Emporium arrive at the party's location, regardless of where they saw it last.": "流浪帝王（见\"（%0%）\"）几乎可以在任何时候出现在九层地狱的任何地方。如果玩家不知道下一步该去哪里或做什么，或者你想用有趣的角色扮演机会给他们一个惊喜，那么让流浪帝王城到达聚会的地点，不管他们最后在哪里看到它。",
	"There are simple ways in which you can tailor the adventure to make Avernus an even more hellish place for your particular band of adventurers. Consider using the following methods to customize your party's experience:": "你可以用一些简单的方法来定制冒险，使阿弗纳斯成为你的特定冒险者队伍的一个更可怕的地方。考虑使用以下方法来定制你的队伍的经验。",
	"Learn what scares the characters. At the start of the adventure, ask each player to provide you with a note of three things their character fears. Save these until the party reaches the Nine Hells, then use them to customize the terrors that populate Avernus.": "了解人物害怕的东西。在冒险开始时，要求每个玩家向你提供他们的角色害怕的三样东西的笔记。把这些东西保存起来，直到队伍到达九层地狱，然后用它们来定制阿弗纳斯的恐怖事物。",
	"Keep a list of the flaws that the players selected when they first created their characters, so that you can remind the players of these faults when situations arise to test them. For example, a character with the Folk Hero background might have the flaw, \"I'm quick to assume that someone is trying to cheat me.\" Let the player wrestle with this flaw during negotiations with devils and other denizens of Avernus.": "把玩家在第一次创建角色时选择的缺陷列一个清单，这样，当出现考验玩家的情况时，你就可以提醒他们这些缺陷。例如，一个有民间英雄背景的角色可能有这样的缺陷：\"我很快就会认为有人想欺骗我\"。让玩家在与魔鬼和其他Avernus居民的谈判中与这个缺陷搏斗。",
	"Baldur's Gate began as a harbor town where traders would meet with \"ghost lighters\"—folk along the Sword Coast who used lights to lure fogbound ships to shore. When those ships ran aground, the ghost lighters would scavenge the wrecks and haul their plundered goods to Baldur's Gate, nestled on the north shore of a bend in the River Chionthar, and sell their booty. In the years since, Baldur's Gate has grown into a walled city. Today, its foggy streets run red with the blood of unfortunates who fall prey to evil opportunists, many of whom count themselves as nobles, traders, pirates, and assassins. An army of mercenary soldiers called the Flaming Fist keeps order in the city, and these soldiers answer to Grand Duke {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA}. The members of the Flaming Fist don't care about justice; they crave power and coin, nothing else. But despite the Fist's reputation for cruelty, the Grand Duke is widely regarded as an honorable and reasonable man.": "博德之门最初是一个港口城镇，商人们会在这里与 \"幽灵打火机 \"会面--剑海岸的居民们用灯光引诱雾中的船只靠岸。当这些船搁浅时，幽灵打火机会搜刮残骸，并将他们掠夺的货物拖到博德之门，依偎在基昂萨尔河弯道的北岸，并出售他们的战利品。在此后的岁月里，博德之门已经发展成为一座有围墙的城市。今天，它雾蒙蒙的街道上流淌着不幸者的鲜血，他们是邪恶的机会主义者的猎物，其中许多人把自己当作贵族、商人、海盗和刺客。一支名为 \"火焰之拳 \"的雇佣兵军队维持着城市的秩序，这些士兵向大公爵（%0%）负责。火焰之拳的成员并不关心正义；他们渴望权力和钱财，而不是其他。但是，尽管火焰之拳以残酷著称，大公却被广泛认为是一个可敬和合理的人。",
	"The city of Elturel, capital of Elturgard, is located much farther inland along the River Chionthar. Whereas Baldur's Gate has a well-earned reputation for being a nest of vipers, Elturel is seen as a beacon of faith, order, and high culture. The two cities have endured a long, bitter rivalry that originated when Baldur's Gate began stealing cargo and coin from ships heading to and from Elturel, stifling that city's sea trade. Though the conflicts between Baldur's Gate and Elturel have always fallen short of open warfare, relations between the cities have been tense for a long time—too long, some would say.": "Elturgard的首府Elturel市位于Chionthar河沿岸更远的内陆地区。博德之门因其是一个毒蛇的巢穴而获得了良好的声誉，而Elturel则被视为信仰、秩序和高级文化的灯塔。这两座城市长期以来一直存在着激烈的竞争，起源于博德之门开始从往来Elturel的船上偷取货物和钱币，扼杀了该城市的海上贸易。虽然Baldur's Gate和Elturel之间的冲突一直没有公开的战争，但这两个城市之间的关系已经紧张了很久，有人会说太长了。",
	"A tenday ago, Grand Duke {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA} left Baldur's Gate with a company of Flaming Fist soldiers on a diplomatic mission to Elturel, accepting a formal invitation from Elturel's High Overseer, {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}. Ravengard did not go eagerly, however. It took months of persuasion by his fellow dukes—the other three members of Baldur's Gate's ruling Council of Four—to convince him to accept Elturel's invitation and leave the city in their capable hands. {@creature Duke Thalamra Vanthampur|BGDIA} was especially convincing, having gathered petitions from the nobility as well as leaders of the common rabble.": "一天前，大公爵{@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA}带着一连火焰之拳的士兵离开博德之门，前往艾尔图勒执行外交任务，接受艾尔图勒的高级监督官{@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}的正式邀请。然而，拉文格德并没有急着去。他的同僚公爵们--博德之门执政的四人委员会的其他三位成员花了几个月的时间来说服他接受Elturel的邀请，把城市交给他们来管理。{@creature Duke Thalamra Vanthampur|BGDIA}特别有说服力，他收集了来自贵族以及普通乌合之众领袖的请愿书。",
	"Not long after Ravengard arrived in Elturel, the city was dragged down into the Nine Hells—wiped off the map. Given the distance between the two cities, it's no surprise that the residents of Baldur's Gate didn't hear of Elturel's fate until refugees from Elturgard starting arriving in droves. Rumors concerning Elturel's disappearance spread like wildfire, stoking fears that Baldur's Gate might be next. At the same time, panic swept through the ranks of the Flaming Fist, which suddenly found itself without a strong leader.": "在Ravengard到达Elturel不久，这座城市就被拖入了九层地狱--从地图上抹去了。鉴于两座城市之间的距离，博德之门的居民没有听说Elturel的命运，直到Elturgard的难民开始成群结队地到来，这并不奇怪。有关Elturel失踪的谣言像野火一样蔓延，激起了人们对Baldur's Gate可能是下一个的恐惧。同时，恐慌席卷了火焰之拳的队伍，它突然发现自己没有一个强有力的领导者。",
	"In the grand duke's absence, the government of Baldur's Gate continues to function under the three remaining dukes—Belynne Stelmane, Dillard Portyr, and Thalamra Vanthampur. Duke Portyr has gone so far as to recall his niece, Liara Portyr, from her post as commander of the Flaming Fist at Fort Beluarian in Chult, in the hopes that she can keep the Flaming Fist in check. However, it will take time for her ship to arrive. Meanwhile, refugees from Elturgard continue to arrive with dire claims that nothing remains of Elturel except a crater in the ground.": "在大公不在的情况下，博德之门的政府继续在剩下的三位公爵--斯泰尔曼尼（Belynne Stelmane）、迪拉德-波特尔（Dillard Portyr）和塔拉姆拉-范坦普尔（Thalamra Vanthampur）的领导下运作。波蒂尔公爵甚至把他的侄女利亚拉-波蒂尔从楚尔特的贝卢安堡的火焰之拳指挥官的岗位上召回，希望她能控制住火焰之拳的发展。然而，她的船需要时间才能到达。与此同时，来自Elturgard的难民继续到来，他们可怕地声称Elturel除了地面上的一个大坑外什么都没有留下。",
	"Among those fleeing Elturgard are several Hellriders—paladins who have sworn oaths to defend Elturel. Those warriors escaped the city's fate only because they weren't in Elturel when it fell, and the Flaming Fist has taken to arresting them on sight, lest they try to stir up trouble in Baldur's Gate. The Hellriders are not going quietly, however, leading to violence and bloodshed.": "在那些逃离艾尔图加德的人中，有几个地狱骑士--那些发誓要保卫艾尔图加德的圣骑士。这些战士逃过了城市的命运，只是因为他们在艾尔图勒沦陷时不在那里，而火焰之拳已经采取了当场逮捕他们的做法，以免他们试图在博德之门挑起麻烦。然而，地狱骑士们并没有安静地离开，而是导致了暴力和流血事件。",
	"Without {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA} to stay their hand, Flaming Fist captains are brutally exercising their autonomy under the veneer of maintaining order. They've closed the outer gates to keep Baldur's Gate safe from the refugee \"threat,\" effectively trapping Baldurians behind their own walls. With the Flaming Fist distracted by the refugee crisis, city folk are being hunted and murdered in the streets by cultists of the Dead Three—the evil gods Bane, Bhaal, and Myrkul. Without the Flaming Fist to curtail them, these cultists have grown bold and now move freely within the city, their activities financed and supported in secret by {@creature Duke Thalamra Vanthampur|BGDIA}.": "在没有{@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA}留手的情况下，火焰之拳的队长们在维持秩序的外衣下残酷地行使着他们的自主权。他们关闭了外门，以保证博德门免受难民的 \"威胁\"，实际上是把博德门人困在自己的城墙后面。由于火焰之拳被难民危机分散了注意力，城市居民正在被死亡三神--邪恶的Bane、Bhaal和Myrkul的崇拜者在街上追杀。由于没有火焰之拳的遏制，这些邪教分子胆子越来越大，现在在城市里自由活动，他们的活动得到了（1%）的秘密资助和支持。",
	"Among the first refugees to arrive at Baldur's Gate was none other than {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}, the architect of Elturel's doom. Duke Vanthampur is sheltering Kreeg in the dungeon beneath her villa until such time as Baldur's Gate suffers the same fate as Elturel. Like Kreeg, the Vanthampur family is firmly in debt to Zariel, the archdevil of Avernus. Using money purloined from Tiamat's hoard by Zariel's minions on Avernus, Duke Vanthampur hired Dead Three cultists to stir up trouble while her sons stole the {@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA} from a tomb beneath the city. Using the power of this magic shield, Duke Vanthampur and {@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA} believe they can bring about the downfall of Baldur's Gate in much the same way the Companion was used against Elturel. The shield binds the essence of a powerful devil named Gargauth, whose presence in Baldur's Gate has fomented much of the evil that lurks in the hearts of the city's residents.": "在第一批到达Baldur's Gate的难民中，正是Elturel厄运的设计者（%0%）。Vanthampur公爵把Kreeg藏在她别墅下面的地牢里，直到Baldur's Gate遭受与Elturel同样的命运。和Kreeg一样，Vanthampur家族对Avernus的大恶魔Zariel也是债台高筑。Vanthampur公爵利用Zariel在Avernus上的爪牙从Tiamat的囤积物中偷来的钱，雇佣了死三的邪教徒来挑起事端，而她的儿子们则从城市下面的墓穴中偷出了（%1%）。利用这个魔法盾牌的力量，范坦普尔公爵和{@creature Thavius Kreeg|BGDIA}相信他们可以使博德之门倒台，就像当年用同伴来对付艾尔图勒一样。这面盾牌捆绑了一个名为Gargauth的强大魔鬼的精髓，他在博德之门的存在煽动了许多潜伏在该城市居民心中的邪恶。",
	"To save Baldur's Gate, the adventurers must defeat the Dead Three cultists, track down their evil financiers, wrest the {@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA} from Duke Vanthampur, and pursue Grand Duke {@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA} into the Nine Hells.": "为了拯救博德之门，冒险家们必须打败死三教的邪教徒，追踪他们邪恶的资助者，从范坦普尔公爵手中夺取{@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA}，并将大公爵{@creature Ulder Ravengard|BGDIA}追入九幽地狱。",

From their high perches in the Upper City, the local nobles—known as patriars—gaze down with veiled contempt upon the common rabble in the grimy Lower City, which hugs the foggy harbor. The whole of Baldur's Gate reeks of blood, crime, and opportunity. One can easily fathom why pirates and traders are drawn to this place like flies to a carcass.": "欢迎来到博德之门，这是一个名副其实的老鼠和毒蛇的巢穴，依附在俯瞰奇安塔尔河的岩石坡上。在上城的高处，当地的贵族们被称为 \"爱国者\"，他们带着蔑视的眼光俯视着下城的普通乌合之众，下城紧挨着雾气缭绕的港口。整个博德之门充满了血腥、犯罪和机会的味道。人们很容易理解为什么海盗和商人会像苍蝇一样被吸引到这个地方。",
	"Following the river farther east would eventually lead you to Elturel, capital of the holy land of Elturgard—or at least that was the case until a few days ago.

	"The patriars pay a mercenary army called the Flaming Fist to protect their interests in Baldur's Gate, and by extension, the city itself.

She watched in disbelief as the Companion's light went out, turning black as the city appeared to crumble and sink below the horizon—a horrific image that Reya has been unable to get out of her mind. She returned to Elturel to find a crater where the city once stood, then took it upon herself to lead a group of fearful refugees west to Baldur's Gate. Before the Flaming Fist closed the city gates, Reya and a handful of others managed to sneak inside, but they didn't get far before a group of Flaming Fist soldiers confronted them. The refugees scattered, and Reya soon found herself cornered by a Flaming Fist thug. She wounded the soldier with her longsword, fled down an alley, and stole a cloak to better conceal her armor and weapons. She's been a wanted fugitive ever since.": "城市消失时，雷亚正在埃尔图勒以北几英里处训练。她难以置信地看着同伴的光芒熄灭，当城市似乎崩溃并沉入地平线以下时，她变成了黑色--这是雷亚一直无法忘怀的恐怖画面。她回到Elturel，发现城市曾经存在的一个火山口，然后自告奋勇地带领一群恐惧的难民向西前往Baldur之门。在火焰之拳关闭城门之前，雷亚和其他少数人设法潜入城内，但他们没走多远就被一群火焰之拳的士兵撞见了。难民们四散而逃，雷亚很快发现自己被一个火焰拳头的暴徒逼到了角落。她用长剑打伤了那个士兵，逃到一条小巷里，并偷了一件斗篷以更好地隐藏她的盔甲和武器。从那时起，她就成了一名被通缉的逃犯。",

Reya hasn't confirmed whether the rumor is true, but reports say that Kreeg was seen in the company of four guards employed by the Vanthampur family. The Vanthampur estate is located in the Upper City, beyond her reach, but she has learned that {@creature Amrik Vanthampur|BGDIA} runs a business out of the Low Lantern.

Characters can allay her fears by saying they have no intention of arresting her. In the interests of full disclosure, Reya admits that she's being hunted by the Flaming Fist for an \"unfortunate altercation\" that wasn't entirely her fault.": "如果人物透露他们在为火焰之拳工作，雷亚就会惊慌失措地拔出长剑，以为要为自己辩护。角色可以通过说他们无意逮捕她来消除她的恐惧。为了全面披露，雷亚承认，她被火焰之拳追捕是因为一次 \"不幸的争吵\"，但这并不完全是她的错。",

Pilster is preparing to sign the contract as the characters come upon the pair.": "当人物经过一条小巷时，他们注意到一个（%0%）与一个半身人交谈。这两个人互相关注着对方，使人物很容易靠近，可以听到他们用普通话的对话。这个半身人是个面包师（{@creature commoner}），名叫Pilster Pebblehuck，他和他的家人一直躲在他们面包店的地下室里。他们的食物快吃完了，所以皮尔斯特冒着危险到街上去寻找食物。小恶魔Perchillux为Pilster提供了一个月的食物，并以他的灵魂作为低价。皮尔斯特正准备在合同上签字的时候，这两个人出现了。",
	"The contract is written on parchment made of halfling skin. If any character interrupts the signing and asks to read the contract, the imp tells them this is none of their business. Pilster welcomes the interruption, however, since he is having second thoughts about the deal, and he hands the contract to the characters. A successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check penetrates the dense and convoluted text of the contract—which will give the imp the souls of Pilster's entire family if Pilster signs it.": "契约是写在半身人皮肤制成的羊皮纸上。如果有任何角色打断签约并要求阅读合同，小恶魔会告诉他们这不关他们的事。然而，皮尔斯特欢迎这种打扰，因为他对这笔交易有了新的想法，他把合同交给了这些人物。一个成功的DC15智力（（%0%））检查可以穿透合同中密集而曲折的文字--如果皮尔斯特签署了它，小恶魔就会把皮尔斯特全家的灵魂交给他。",
	"If the characters attack the imp, it turns {@condition invisible} and attempts to escape as quickly as possible. If the characters save Pilster from selling his soul, he thanks the characters and begs them to get him and his family to safety. His wife, Merrywile, and their three children are nearby.": "如果人物攻击小恶魔，它就会变成（%0%），并试图尽快逃跑。如果人物把皮尔斯特从出卖灵魂中救出来，他就会感谢人物，并恳求他们把他和他的家人带到安全的地方。他的妻子Merrywile和他们的三个孩子就在附近。",
	"In addition to the contract, the imp carries a {@item soul coin|BGDIA} from a previous interaction that it plans to give to its master.": "除了合同之外，小恶魔还带着之前互动中的{@item soul coin|BGDIA}，它打算把它的主人给。",
	"In addition to the threats they'll face from fiendish creatures and undead in Elturel, the characters quickly become aware of the threats presented by the city itself.": "除了他们将面临来自Elturel的邪恶生物和亡灵的威胁外，人物很快就意识到了城市本身带来的威胁。",
	"Any creature that falls from Elturel's location high above Avernus plummets 500 feet into the soul-shattering waters of the River Styx, taking 70 ({@dice 20d6}) bludgeoning damage from the fall. The memory-wiping effects of the river are described in \"{@adventure River Styx|BGDIA|2|River Styx}\". However, characters who plunge into the Styx or the battle raging around the river are likely killed immediately, with their bodies beyond recovery.": "任何从Elturel的高处坠落的生物都会坠入500英尺高的冥河中，受到70({@dice 20d6})的重击伤害。冥河的记忆消除效果在\"{@adventure River Styx|BGDIA|2|River Styx} \"中描述。然而，跳入冥河或围绕冥河进行的战斗的人物很可能立即死亡，他们的身体无法恢复。",
	"Lightning from the Companion strikes the city every minute or so. The odds of the characters being harmed by the lightning are slim, but you can use it to reinforce a sense of urgency as the lightning damages a rooftop, triggers a building collapse, or strikes the ground nearby.": "来自同伴的闪电每隔一分钟左右就会袭击这个城市。角色被闪电伤害的几率很小，但你可以利用它来加强紧迫感，因为闪电会破坏屋顶，触发建筑物倒塌，或击中附近的地面。",
	"Every so often, the entire city lurches from side to side as the great posts binding it to Avernus sink farther into the ground. This results in the same kind of damage that would be caused by an earthquake on the Material Plane: loose objects fall, buildings are damaged, cracks form in the ground and the streets, and creatures fall {@condition prone}.": "每隔一段时间，整个城市就会从一边摇晃到另一边，因为将它与阿弗纳斯连接在一起的大柱子更深地沉入地下。这导致了与物质世界的地震相同的损害：松散的物体掉落，建筑物被损坏，地面和街道上形成裂缝，生物坠落（%0%）。",
	"When Elturel shifts, creatures standing on any surface in the city must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall {@condition prone}. In addition, you can describe other damage and drama resulting from a shift. Perhaps a building collapses, forcing any creature close enough to be struck by falling debris to succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 ({@dice 2d6}) bludgeoning damage.": "当Elturel转移时，站在城市任何表面上的生物必须在DC10的灵巧救赎上成功，否则就会跌落（%0%）。此外，你还可以描述转移所带来的其他伤害和灾难。也许一栋建筑倒塌了，迫使任何靠近的生物被坠落的碎片击中，必须在DC15的灵巧救赎中成功，否则就会受到7（{@dice 2d6}）的重击伤害。",
	"A {@creature narzugon|MTF} patrols the streets of Elturel on the back of a {@creature nightmare} equipped with {@item infernal tack|MTF}. The devil has orders to hunt down and destroy any demons that might have slipped past the battle on the ground below and gained access to the city.": "一个{@creature narzugon|MTF}在装备有{@item infernal tack|MTF}的{@creature nightmare}背上，在Elturel的街道上巡逻。这个魔鬼奉命追捕并消灭任何可能从下面地面的战斗中溜走并进入城市的恶魔。",
	"When {@creature Lulu|BGDIA} sees the creature, she tells the characters that it is very powerful and should not be confronted.": "当{@creature Lulu|BGDIA}看到这个生物时，她告诉人物，这个生物非常强大，不应该与之对抗。",
	"The characters see a charred humanoid corpse in the middle of the street, clutching a {@item silvered longsword|phb} in its hand. When any creature moves within 5 feet of the corpse, a gout of hellfire erupts from it. Any creature within 5 feet of the corpse must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 ({@dice 4d6}) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.": "人物看到街道中央有一具烧焦的人形尸体，手里攥着一个（%0%）。当任何生物在尸体的5英尺范围内移动时，一股地狱之火从它身上喷发出来。任何在尸体5英尺范围内的生物都必须做一个DC12的灵巧救赎，救赎失败会受到14({@dice 4d6})的火焰伤害，救赎成功则受到一半的伤害。",
	"If the corpse is examined further, an intact vial is found in its charred belt pouch. The vial contains a {@item Potion of Frost Giant Strength||potion of giant strength (frost)}.": "如果进一步检查尸体，会在其烧焦的腰包里发现一个完整的小瓶。小瓶里有一个{@item Potion of Frost Giant Strength||potion of giant strength (frost)}。",
	"A {@creature vrock} fled the battle and flew up to the city to ponder its role in all things. As long as the characters leave it alone, it doesn't attack. If they approach, it speaks with them, using its telepathy to communicate with one character at a time if none of the characters speaks Abyssal.": "一只（%0%）逃离了战斗，飞上了城市，思考它在所有事物中的作用。只要人物不打扰它，它就不会攻击。如果他们接近，它就会与他们交谈，如果没有一个角色会说深渊语，它就会用心灵感应一次与一个角色交流。",
	"The vrock pontificates on the vagaries and possible meanings of existence. If the characters treat it nicely, indulge it in its ponderings, and succeed on a DC 13 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check, they can get it to do them one small favor. If they attack it, the vrock repays their hostility in kind.": "岩石对存在的变化无常和可能的意义进行论证。如果人物善待它，让它沉浸在自己的思索中，并在DC13魅力({@skill Persuasion})检查中成功，他们可以让它帮他们一个小忙。如果他们攻击它，岩怪会以牙还牙。",
	"Favors from the vrock might include providing information about what's happening beneath the city, about what forces guard the bridges between the city's east and west sections, or about the demons' plan to use a portal to enter the city (see {@area area G12|183|x}), although it doesn't know where that portal is.": "岩石的恩惠可能包括提供关于城市地下发生的事情的信息，关于什么力量守卫着城市东西两部分之间的桥梁，或者关于恶魔计划使用传送门进入城市（见（%0%）），尽管它不知道那个传送门在哪里。",
	"As the characters pass a building, they hear a pounding coming from the front door. The door is stuck but not locked, requiring a successful DC 15 Strength check to force it open. If the characters do this, twelve {@creature Zombie||zombies} burst from the building as an avalanche of undead bodies, burying anyone standing near the door in the pile. This leaves those characters and the zombies {@condition prone} at the start of combat.": "当人物经过一栋建筑时，他们听到前门传来一阵敲击声。门被卡住了，但没有被锁住，需要成功地进行DC15力量检查才能把它打开。如果角色们做到了，十二个（%0%）亡灵的尸体就会像雪崩一样从大楼里冲出来，把站在门附近的人都埋在了这堆尸体里。这使得这些角色和僵尸（%1%）在战斗开始的时候就已经离开了。",
	"If the characters deal with the zombies and search the building, they discover that it was a school. Five casks each holding three gallons of fresh water are stored in the basement.": "如果人物处理了僵尸并搜索了建筑物，他们会发现这是一所学校。地下室里存放着五个桶，每个桶里有三加仑的淡水。",
	"Two bridges that once spanned a ravine in the city are now all that connect the east and west sections of Elturel over the great rift that has fallen away beneath them. The north bridge is called Torm's Reach, while the south bridge is named Torm's Blade. Unless the characters can fly or teleport, they must use one of the bridges on their trek toward the High Hall.": "曾经横跨城市峡谷的两座桥，现在只剩下连接Elturel东西两区的桥，而桥下的大裂缝已经消失。北边的桥被称为 \"Torm's Reach\"，而南边的桥被称为 \"Torm's Blade\"。除非人物能够飞行或传送，否则他们必须使用其中的一座桥，向高阶大厅跋涉。",
	"When the characters approach either bridge, they can make out the initial details of the rift and can see the guards blocking the path. Read the following to set the scene:": "当人物走近这两座桥时，他们可以看清裂缝的最初细节，并能看到阻挡道路的卫兵。阅读下面的内容来设置场景。",

	"A bridge twenty feet wide and more than a hundred feet long spans the chasm. Holy runes etched into the stonework of the bridge indicate that the structure has been consecrated in the name of Torm, god of courage and self-sacrifice. Six infernal creatures stand guard at the center of the bridge, scanning in all directions.": "一座20英尺宽、100多英尺长的桥横跨在鸿沟上。桥上的石头上刻着神圣的符文，表明这个结构是以勇气和自我牺牲之神托尔姆的名义献祭的。六个地狱生物在桥的中心站岗，向各个方向扫描。",
	"Each bridge is guarded by an infernal force tasked with cutting off any assistance between the east and west sides of the city. Each group consists of two {@creature Bearded Devil||bearded devils} and four {@creature Spined Devil||spined devils}. Unsubtle brutes, these creatures have parked themselves in the middle of each bridge to maintain a vigilant watch. Taking them on is a tough fight, but the characters might have a trick up their collective sleeves.": "每座桥都有一支无间道部队把守，任务是切断城市东西两边的任何援助。每组由两个（%0%）和四个（%1%）组成。这些生物是不折不扣的野蛮人，他们把自己停在每座桥的中间，保持警惕。对付它们是一场艰苦的战斗，但角色们可能有一个集体袖子的技巧。",
	"Any character trained in {@skill Arcana}, {@skill History}, or {@skill Religion} recognizes that the runes etched into the stonework of each bridge can be activated to produce a radiant energy harmful to fiends and undead. A character touching the bridge who succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Religion}) check as an action can speak the proper prayers to Torm to activate the runes for 1 minute. While the runes are active, any fiend or undead creature that starts its turn in contact with the bridge takes 22 ({@dice 4d10}) radiant damage. When this effect ends, the runes cannot be activated again for 1 hour.": "任何接受过{@skill Arcana}、{@skill History}或{@skill Religion}训练的角色都能认识到，刻在每座桥石板上的符文可以被激活，产生一种对恶魔和亡灵有害的辐射能量。触摸桥梁的角色如果在DC15智力（（%3%））检查中成功，就可以向托尔姆说出适当的祈祷，激活符文，持续1分钟。当符文处于激活状态时，任何开始接触桥的魔族或不死生物都会受到22({@dice 4d10})辐射伤害。当这个效果结束时，符文在1小时内不能再被激活。",
	"Although the forces of Avernus are occupied driving back the demonic attack from the River Styx, a few teams of devils have been ordered to infiltrate Elturel, sow chaos among the surviving citizenry, reap the souls of any mortals they find, and test the city's defenses. The members of some of those advance teams have noted that the High Hall appears to be the center of the city's defenses and survival efforts. As such, they have decided to mount a quick and decisive strike against it.": "虽然Avernus的部队正忙着驱赶来自冥河的恶魔攻击，但有几队恶魔被命令潜入Elturel，在幸存的市民中制造混乱，收割他们发现的任何凡人的灵魂，并测试该城市的防御。其中一些先遣队的成员注意到，高堂似乎是城市防御和生存努力的中心。因此，他们决定对它进行一次快速和决定性的打击。",
	"As the characters approach the High Hall, they see that a devilish assault on the fortress's cathedral is underway. The characters can enter the fray, defeat the perpetrators, and help bring temporary stability to the situation. After defeating the devils, the characters learn from the survivors that Grand Duke Ravengard was at the High Hall, but left recently. He took a contingent of soldiers with him to the city's cemetery, hoping that an ancient relic found there might help save the city.": "当人物接近大殿时，他们看到一场对要塞大教堂的魔鬼式攻击正在进行中。角色们可以进入战场，击败肇事者，并帮助使局势暂时稳定。打败魔鬼后，人物从幸存者那里得知，拉文加德大公曾在大殿，但最近离开了。他带着一队士兵去了城市的墓地，希望在那里发现的一个古老的遗迹可以帮助拯救这个城市。",
	"The High Hall is a grand alabaster castle dedicated to Torm, the god of courage and self-sacrifice. It houses many of Elturel's religious and political leaders—or at least it did when the city was in the mortal realm.": "大厅是一座宏伟的雪花石城堡，供奉着勇气和自我牺牲之神托姆。它容纳了许多Elturel的宗教和政治领袖--至少当城市还在凡间的时候是这样。",
	"Shortly after Elturel was pulled into Avernus, a meteor hurled through the High Hall, collapsing the offices and residences of those who could best organize a defense of the city. Most of the leaders of Elturel were killed by the meteor, but Grand Duke Ravengard of Baldur's Gate and his retinue were spared the devastation. Ravengard immediately took control of the situation, marshaled Elturel's remaining forces, and set out a plan to protect the city. Ravengard's forces couldn't save the eastern part of the city, and more frequent demonic and devilish incursions have worn away at their control of the western portion.": "在Elturel被拉入Avernus后不久，一颗流星投掷到市政厅，使那些能够最好地组织城市防御的人的办公室和住所倒塌。大多数Elturel的领导人都被流星杀死了，但Baldur's Gate的Ravengard大公爵和他的随从却免于这场灾难。拉文加德立即控制了局势，调集Elturel的剩余部队，并制定了一个保护城市的计划。拉文加德的部队没能拯救城市的东部，更频繁的恶魔和魔鬼的入侵已经消磨了他们对西部的控制。",
	"The survivors here—including the last of the city's leadership—have taken up residence in the cathedral part of the High Hall, perhaps the most secure and sturdy edifice left in Elturel. Yet even the cathedral is under assault, and without the characters' assistance, its defenders are sure to fall.": "这里的幸存者--包括城市最后的领导层--已经住进了高堂的大教堂部分，这也许是Elturel中最安全、最坚固的建筑了。然而，即使是大教堂也受到了攻击，如果没有这些人物的帮助，它的守卫者肯定会倒下。",

The wooden gates that once led into the castle grounds have been shattered, leaving a gaping hole in the wall.": "这座悬崖上的城堡曾经是艾尔图勒最重要的建筑瑰宝。它的五座瞭望塔中只有三座还在，不过它们似乎已经被遗弃。曾经通向城堡的木门已经破碎，在墙上留下一个缺口。",
	"The west side of the castle has been reduced to a pile of smashed brick and broken wood. The surviving buildings are blackened by soot. At the center of the castle grounds, the High Hall cathedral stands defiant.": "城堡的西侧已经变成了一堆被砸碎的砖头和碎木头。幸存的建筑都被烟尘熏黑了。在城堡场地的中心，高堂大教堂傲然挺立。",
	"No threats reveal themselves to the characters as they enter the castle grounds. Once inside, they spot two humans in plate armor lying dead on the ground near the shattered gate, blood still oozing from their bite wounds.": "当他们进入城堡的时候，没有任何威胁暴露出来。一进去，他们就发现两个身穿板甲的人类躺在破碎的大门附近的地上，被咬伤的伤口还在渗血。",
	"As the characters approach the center of the courtyard, they see two {@creature Hell Hound||hell hounds} standing guard in front of the cathedral doors. These fiends have been instructed by their devil masters to prevent any mortal creatures from entering or leaving the cathedral.": "当人物接近院子的中心时，他们看到两个（%0%）在大教堂的门前站岗。这些魔鬼受他们的魔鬼主人的指示，阻止任何凡人生物进出大教堂。",
	"The characters must defeat the hell hounds to gain access to the cathedral. Have them make a DC 15 group Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) check to find cover amid the rubble as they move. If half or more of the characters succeed on their individual checks, the group check is successful, allowing the characters to reach the base of the cathedral steps without being noticed by the hell hounds. This grants the characters surprise when the fight begins.": "角色们必须打败地狱猎犬才能进入大教堂。让他们做一个DC15的团体灵巧（{@skill Stealth}）检查，以便在移动时在废墟中找到掩护。如果有一半或更多的角色在他们各自的检定中成功，那么团体检定就会成功，允许角色在不被地狱猎犬发现的情况下到达大教堂的台阶底部。这使角色们在战斗开始时获得惊喜。",
	"Four groups of devils and their allies are moving through the cathedral. These groups are spread out to cause as much havoc as possible, and have orders to kill everyone in their path.": "四组魔鬼和他们的盟友正在穿越大教堂。这些团体分散开来，以造成尽可能多的破坏，并奉命杀死他们路上的所有人。",
	"As the DM, you can decide where the characters encounter each of these groups. These encounters are meant to be run separately, although running two encounters back-to-back with no chance for the characters to rest or heal can be a good challenge for a powerful party.": "作为管理员，你可以决定角色在哪里遇到这些团体。这些遭遇战是要分开进行的，尽管在没有机会让角色休息或治疗的情况下背靠背地进行两个遭遇战，对一个强大的队伍来说也是一个很好的挑战。",
	"If you want to keep these encounters simple and straightforward, you can have them take place in locations with no strange effects or hazards. If you want to make an encounter more interesting, have the combat take place during a quake (see the \"{@area Elturel Hazards|123|x}\" sidebar). If you want a fight to go easier for the characters, have some of the foes withdraw or have some NPC survivors assist the characters.": "如果你想让这些遭遇战保持简单明了，你可以让它们发生在没有奇怪影响或危险的地方。如果你想使遭遇战更加有趣，可以让战斗发生在地震期间（见\"{@area Elturel Hazards|123|x} \"侧边栏）。如果你想让一场战斗对角色来说更容易些，可以让一些敌人撤退，或者让一些NPC幸存者协助角色。",
	"Most of the survivors currently in the cathedral are preparing for a last stand in the main crypts ({@area area H16|159|x}), so that area should be free of devils unless the characters arrive there just as the devils do.": "目前在大教堂里的大部分幸存者都在准备在主墓室（（%0%））进行最后的抵抗，所以那个区域应该没有魔鬼，除非人物在魔鬼到来时正好到达那里。",
	"This group is led by the mastermind behind the raid on the cathedral: Victuusa, a {@creature white abishai|MTF}.

	"A {@creature spined devil} leads three human brigands (use the {@creature bandit captain} stat block to represent them) on a rampage. The brigands were driven mad by the journey to Avernus, and have now pledged themselves to their spined devil master. Their madness causes them to bellow and gibber as they move through the cathedral. The spined devil roars at them as it uses its telepathy to order them to focus. This lack of caution and discipline makes ambushing or sneaking up on the group easy, granting advantage on Dexterity ({@skill Stealth}) checks to do so.": "一个{@creature spined devil}带领三个人类强盗（用{@creature bandit captain}状态块来代表他们）横冲直撞。这些强盗在前往阿弗纳斯的旅途中被逼疯了，现在他们已经向他们的脊柱魔鬼主人宣誓。他们的疯狂导致他们在大教堂里咆哮和胡言乱语。脊柱魔鬼一边对他们吼叫，一边用心灵感应命令他们集中精力。这种缺乏谨慎和纪律的行为使得伏击或偷袭这群人变得很容易，并在灵巧度（（2%））的检查中获得优势，从而做到这一点。",

	"Once decorated with beautiful paintings, statues, and other works that depicted the strength and valor of Elturel's people, the cathedral was magically transformed when Elturel was pulled into Avernus. Now its artwork is a testament to the devils' superiority and strength, showing scenes of mortals succumbing to temptation, dying at the hands of fiends, and suffering eternal torture. When viewed, those images shift and swirl unsettlingly. A {@spell detect magic} spell reveals that the frescoes, mosaics, paintings, and tapestries of the cathedral radiate auras of illusion magic. These effects end if Elturel is freed from the chains of Avernus.": "大教堂曾经用美丽的绘画、雕像和其他作品来装饰，描述Elturel人民的力量和勇气，当Elturel被拉入Avernus时，大教堂被神奇地改造了。现在，它的艺术品证明了魔鬼的优越性和力量，展示了凡人屈服于诱惑、死于魔鬼之手和遭受永恒折磨的场景。在观看时，这些图像会发生变化，令人不安地旋转。一个（%0%）的法术显示，大教堂的壁画、马赛克、绘画和挂毯都散发着幻觉魔法的光环。如果Elturel从Avernus的枷锁中解脱出来，这些效果就会结束。",

	"As the characters investigate the cemetery, they observe dozens of {@creature Skeleton||skeletons} and {@creature Zombie||zombies} moving about the grounds. These undead, wandering aimlessly and without direction, pose no threat to the characters on their way into the chapel. However, if the characters fail to deal with Gideon before leaving Elturel, the priest has time to coordinate the efforts of the undead, turning them into a potent threat against the city.": "当人物调查墓地时，他们观察到几十个{@creature Skeleton||skeletons}和{@creature Zombie||zombies}在地面上移动。这些亡灵漫无目的地游荡，没有方向，对进入小教堂的人物没有威胁。然而，如果人物在离开艾尔图勒之前没有处理好吉迪恩，牧师就有时间来协调这些亡灵的工作，将它们变成对城市的强大威胁。",

These skeletons attack any intruders on the cemetery grounds.": "当人物接近小教堂时，他们被三个{@creature Minotaur Skeleton||minotaur skeletons}被杀的巴弗灭的仆人搭讪，他们被剥去了肉体，被吉迪恩用同伴的力量赋予了活力。这些骷髅会攻击任何闯入墓地的人。",

	"Each pillar is hollow and houses an incorporeal undead creature: four {@creature Shadow||shadows} and four {@creature Specter||specters} in total. Seven of the undead emerge from the pillars to attack any character who attempts to enter the chapel. The specter closest to the priest quarters ({@area area G5|171|x}) instead attempts to move to that area and warn Gideon of the intruders.

	"The once-beautiful main area of the chapel is littered with broken furnishings and splintered chairs. The stained-glass windows have all been smashed, though one remains mostly intact where it's fallen whole to the floor. It depicts a representation of the god Torm placing a golden helm on the head of a man kneeling before him.": "小教堂曾经美丽的主区域到处都是破碎的家具和四分五裂的椅子。彩色玻璃窗都被砸碎了，不过有一扇玻璃窗还基本完好无损地倒在了地上。它描绘了托尔姆神将一个金色的头盔戴在一个跪在他面前的人的头上的情景。",

	"The window lying mostly whole on the floor is cracked and has been trodden on, but the scene it shows is still recognizable. A successful DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill History} or {@skill Religion}) check allows a character to recognize the scene as showing Torm presenting the Helm of Torm's Sight to Lannish Fogel, a revered hero of Elturel's past and a dedicated paladin of Torm. The helm pictured in the stained glass is the relic Grand Duke Ravengard came to the chapel in search of.": "躺在地板上的窗户大部分是完整的，而且被踩坏了，但它所显示的场景仍然可以辨认。成功通过DC10智力({@skill History}或{@skill Religion})检查，可以让角色认出这个场景是托尔姆向兰尼什-福格尔展示托尔姆之眼的头盔，他是艾尔图勒过去受人尊敬的英雄，也是托尔姆的忠实圣骑士。彩绘玻璃中的头盔是拉文加德大公爵来小教堂寻找的遗物。",
	"The smashed remnants of fine furniture and the remains of stained-glass windows are strewn across this area. Sections of one huge stained-glass window remain intact, enough so that its subject can still be made out. The window once portrayed Lathander standing amid fallen soldiers, holding his hands aloft as the spirits of the dead rise to stand at his side.": "精美的家具和彩色玻璃窗的残骸被砸碎，散落在这个区域。一扇巨大的彩色玻璃窗的部分仍然完好无损，足以让人看清其主题。这扇窗户曾经描绘过拉桑德站在倒下的士兵中间，当死者的灵魂站在他身边时，他的双手高高举起。",

Only one such weapon can be gained by the characters in this way.": "出现的武器是一个（%0%）。这个物品的形式是该人物当时挥舞或佩戴的任何武器，在战斗中对祈求者最有用。人物通过这种方式只能获得一件这样的武器。",
	"Three curtained archways connect this chamber to the other areas of the chapel. Shattered wardrobes and dressing tables, as well as a number of smashed mirrors, suggest that this was once where priests prepared for their daily services. Spiral stairs leading down are guarded by two creatures with insectoid features. Each one is armed with a wicked trident.": "三个带窗帘的拱门将这个房间与小教堂的其他区域连接起来。碎裂的衣柜和梳妆台，以及一些被砸碎的镜子，表明这里曾经是牧师们准备日常服务的地方。通往下层的螺旋形楼梯由两个具有昆虫特征的生物把守。每个人都拿着一把邪恶的三叉戟。",
	"The stairs lead down into the workshop ({@area area G7|177|x}) on the ossuary level.

	"Just as the characters are about to face off against the fiends, a cacophony erupts from below, and six creatures rush up the stairs: a fiendish {@creature giant scorpion} trailed by five {@creature Dretch||dretches}. In response, the mezzoloths (and Gideon, if present) ignore the characters completely, focusing all their attacks on the scorpion and the demons. If Gideon is present and the characters refrain from attacking him after the first round or two, they have advantage on checks to parley with him after the battle. Otherwise, they have disadvantage on those checks.": "正当人物要与恶魔对峙时，下面爆发出一阵喧哗，六个生物冲上楼梯：一个恶魔（%0%），后面跟着五个（%1%）。作为回应，马佐洛斯（如果在场的话，还有吉迪恩）完全无视这些角色，把所有的攻击都集中在蝎子和恶魔身上。如果吉迪恩在场，并且人物在第一或第二轮后没有攻击他，那么他们在战斗后与他谈判的检查中就有优势。否则，他们在这些检查中处于劣势。",
	"If Gideon is present, he lowers his weapon after all the demonic creatures are dead. If he is not here at the start of the fight, he arrives from his quarters during the battle or after the demons are defeated. He speaks to the characters, thanking them for any assistance in defeating the demonic intruders. He makes it clear that his singular focus is stopping the demonic incursion of Elturel—at all costs.": "如果吉迪恩在场，他在所有的恶魔生物都死后放下武器。如果他在战斗开始时不在这里，他会在战斗中或在恶魔被击败后从他的住处赶来。他对人物说话，感谢他们在击败恶魔入侵者时提供的帮助。他明确表示，他的唯一重点是阻止恶魔对艾尔图勒的入侵--不惜一切代价。",
	"If the characters ask about Ravengard, Gideon tells them that an armed group of humans entered the ossuary level earlier. Since they were not demons, he allowed them to pass, but with demons now coming from that area, Gideon angrily assumes that the humans are in league with the demons.": "如果角色们问起拉文加德，吉迪恩就会告诉他们，一队武装的人类早些时候进入了奥赛尔层。因为他们不是恶魔，所以他允许他们通过，但现在恶魔从那片区域过来，吉迪恩愤怒地认为人类与恶魔是一伙的。",
	"A successful DC 12 Charisma ({@skill Deception} or {@skill Persuasion}) check allows the characters to earn Gideon's trust.

Gideon doesn't accompany the characters, wanting to guard the chapel against demon attacks.": "成功通过DC12魅力（{@skill Deception}或{@skill Persuasion}）检查可以让角色赢得吉迪恩的信任。如果他们能让他相信他们在这里只是为了杀死恶魔，他就允许他们进入墓室--甚至为他们提供一个{@creature mezzoloth}的服务，如果这些生物中的任何一个幸存下来。吉迪恩没有陪同这些人物，他想守住小教堂，防止恶魔袭击。",

It sits open at the center of the partially collapsed desk.": "这个简单的建筑包含一张床、一张桌子、一个梳妆台、一张桌子和椅子。大部分家具已被毁坏，装饰品和其他物品胡乱地散落在房间里，包括拉桑德、托尔姆、赫尔姆和泰尔的神圣符号。一本大书似乎在毁灭中幸存下来。它敞开着放在部分倒塌的书桌中央。",

	"The book is a testament written by Gideon in the months leading up to Elturel's fall. It pontificates about the evil of demons, instructing the reader to be ever vigilant against their incursions, and expounding that the demonic threat must be defeated at all costs. It praises the devils that stoically stand against the unending demonic tide, while chastising Helm, Torm, Tyr, Lathander, and their angelic servitors for not doing the same. Gideon has nothing but praise for Zariel's efforts to end the demonic threat. Any character who spends 10 minutes poring over the tome can conclude, with a successful DC 10 Intelligence ({@skill Investigation}) check, that it's the work of a madman.": "这本书是吉迪恩在埃尔图勒灭亡前的几个月里写的遗嘱。书中论述了恶魔的邪恶，指示读者要时刻警惕恶魔的入侵，并阐述了必须不惜一切代价打败恶魔的威胁。它赞扬那些坚忍不拔地抵御无休止的恶魔潮的魔鬼，同时责备赫尔姆、托尔姆、提尔、拉坦德以及他们的天使仆人没有这样做。吉迪恩对扎里尔为结束恶魔威胁所做的努力赞不绝口。任何花了10分钟来研究这本巨著的人物都可以得出结论，只要成功通过DC10智力（（%0%））检查，这就是一个疯子的作品。",
	"Any character who continues to read the book beyond that basic level of understanding must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed check, the character is cursed with a particularly intense hatred of demons. A creature cursed in this way takes 5 ({@dice 1d10}) psychic damage if it can see any demon within 60 feet of it and ends its turn not having attempted to attack a demon. This curse can be removed with a {@spell remove curse} spell or similar magic. At the end of each long rest, a cursed creature can make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.": "任何继续阅读这本书的角色，如果超过了这个基本的理解水平，就必须在DC15智慧救赎上取得成功。如果检查失败，该角色就会被诅咒，对恶魔有特别强烈的憎恨。以这种方式被诅咒的生物，如果能看到它周围60英尺内的任何恶魔，并在其回合结束时没有试图攻击一个恶魔，就会受到5（（%0%））的精神伤害。这个诅咒可以用{@spell remove curse}的咒语或类似的魔法来消除。在每次长休结束时，被诅咒的生物可以做一个DC15的智慧救赎动作，如果成功则结束对它的影响。",

Climbing the sides of the pit without equipment requires a successful DC 10 Strength ({@skill Athletics}) check.": "任何在一个回合中第一次进入迷雾的生物或在那里开始回合的生物都会受到5({@dice 1d10})的坏死伤害。在没有装备的情况下爬上坑的两侧需要成功地进行DC10力量（{@skill Athletics}）检查。",

Ravengard was beginning to establish a connection with Torm when a disturbance in this room brought him and his guards into combat with demonic creatures sent through the portal by Baphomet. Ravengard was subjected to a psychic attack that drew his mind into a connection with Baphomet. Now the helm can't be removed, and he is locked in a mental battle with the demon lord.

A successful DC 15 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana} or {@skill Religion}) check reveals that the psychic struggle taking place within Ravengard's mind is between some divine higher power and a terrible, demonic entity. The power of the portal is now tied into the helm, and to Ravengard. The same check also reveals that no simple spell can break this hold—but that a more involved ritual might free Ravengard and shut down the portal by allowing the power of Torm to sanctify this area once more.": "任何懂天体或深渊的角色都能认出拉文加德口中的一些话。当托姆和巴弗灭通过他说话时，他在两种语言之间交替进行。成功通过DC15智力（{@skill Arcana}或{@skill Religion}）检查，就会发现在拉文加德的头脑中发生的精神斗争是在某种神圣的高级力量和一种可怕的恶魔实体之间进行的。传送门的力量现在与头盔和拉文加德息息相关。同样的检查还显示，没有任何简单的法术可以打破这种束缚--但是一个更复杂的仪式可能会释放拉文加德，并通过让托尔姆的力量再次神圣化这个区域来关闭传送门。",

	"Characters who hurl themselves into the fiendish conflict are as good as dead, but circumstances might necessitate one or more characters moving unseen through the ranks of devils and hordes of demons. Such a plan might include causing a distraction that moves the battle in a different direction, waiting for a demon surge (or creating one) to disturb the stalemate enough to sneak through, or magical disguises that would allow characters to pass themselves off as fiends of a sort. Particularly clever plans should be allowed to automatically succeed. Otherwise, you can call for ability checks to determine how well a plan is executed; use the guidelines in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} to set appropriate DCs for these checks.

	"Avernus was not always the blasted, war-torn battlefield it is today. Long ago, it was a plane of lush gardens and bucolic beauty created by Asmodeus to tempt mortals.

The Nine Hells allows souls to exist in a concentrated form, where they can work through their spiritual bondage to express their dark desires such as cruelty, covetousness, the need to control, the craving for power, and uncontrolled greed. Hell offers an eternity of fulfillment from the most insignificant desires to the seven deadly sins. Every shred of evil is used in the Nine Hells, and each layer specializes in some way to accommodate and exploit the vices and weaknesses of mortals. The devils of Avernus seek to exploit pride and wrath, promising the aggrieved, enraged, and egotistical the power to fulfill their darkest obsessions. Such fulfillment, however, comes at a price.": "阿弗纳斯（Avernus）并不是一个明确用于惩罚邪恶灵魂的地方；相反，它代表了邪恶灵魂在结束他们作为凡人的邪恶生活后的 \"下一个层次\"。九层地狱允许灵魂以集中的形式存在，在那里他们可以通过精神束缚来表达他们的黑暗欲望，如残忍、贪婪、控制的需要、对权力的渴望和不受控制的贪婪。地狱提供了一个永恒的满足，从最微不足道的欲望到七宗罪。每一丝邪恶都被用在九层地狱中，每一层都以某种方式专门适应和利用凡人的恶习和弱点。阿弗纳斯的魔鬼们试图利用骄傲和愤怒，承诺给那些受委屈的、被激怒的和自负的人以力量，以实现他们最黑暗的痴迷。然而，这种满足是有代价的。",

	"In some ways, Zariel is a jewel in Asmodeus's crown—a former angel, now an archdevil, in his infernal service.

His theory suggests that the central obelisk grants a boost in arcane power to mages across the cosmos, and he urges the characters to aid him in empowering it.

He makes each guest of Infernal Rapture feel as though they're the most important person in all the planes of existence, catering to their every whim and desire. While he is equally cordial to all guests of the Wandering Emporium, those entering his establishment fall under a special contract and therefore rank most highly in his esteem.": "外表上，马哈迪把自己表现为一个有魅力和亲切的主人。他让每一位 \"无间狂欢 \"的客人感到他们是所有存在的星球中最重要的人，满足他们的每一个奇思妙想和愿望。虽然他对 \"流浪帝王 \"的所有客人都同样亲切，但那些进入他的机构的人都有一个特殊的合同，因此在他的敬意中地位最高。",
	"Of course, guests leaving Infernal Rapture are expected to pay their bills in full prior to departure. If a guest cannot pay for whatever reason, the contract they signed on entry clearly stipulates their soul is forfeit. They're required to pay off their debt through service. All such individuals fall under the effect of a {@spell geas} cast as a 9th-level spell, which cannot be willingly broken by the affected individual until their debt is paid in full. What Mahadi does with such defaulters depends on their capabilities. Some become indentured servants, working at Infernal Rapture. If they possess a talent for sales, they might eventually obtain a business to run within the Wandering Emporium.": "当然，离开无间道的客人应该在离开前全额支付他们的账单。如果客人因任何原因无法支付，他们在进入时签署的合同中明确规定他们的灵魂被没收了。他们需要通过服务来偿还他们的债务。所有这样的人都会受到（%0%）作为9级法术的影响，在他们的债务得到全额偿还之前，受影响的人无法自愿解除。马哈迪如何处理这些违约者取决于他们的能力。有些人成为契约仆人，在无间狂喜工作。如果他们拥有销售方面的天赋，他们最终可能会在 \"漂泊帝国 \"中获得一份商业经营权。",
	"If adventurers inform Mahadi (and by extension Asmodeus) about Arkhan's possession of the {@item Hand of Vecna}, Mahadi does everything he can to strike a deal with them, offering any of the gifts listed under \"{@area Mahadi's Deals|29b|x}\" in exchange for the artifact. This is in lieu of the terms normally offered by Asmodeus.": "如果冒险者告知马哈迪（以及阿斯莫德）阿克汗拥有{@item Hand of Vecna}，马哈迪会尽其所能与他们达成交易，提供\"{@area Mahadi's Deals|29b|x} \"下所列的任何礼物以换取神器。这是为了代替阿斯莫德通常提供的条件。",
	"Mahadi has the power to make deals at the direction and with the authority of Asmodeus as if he were an archdevil (see {@adventure appendix A|BGDIA|10}). All such deals must be presented to the other party without alteration, and they are not negotiable. In all such agreements, Asmodeus wants one thing only: a character signing one of these contracts gives up their soul forever. After the signing character reaches 17th level, if at any point they die, their death is permanent, with no chance to return from the grave. Asmodeus takes their soul and makes them a {@creature pit fiend}, in his service for eternity.": "马哈迪有权力在阿斯莫德的指示和授权下进行交易，就像他是个大恶魔一样（见（%0%））。所有这些交易都必须提交给另一方，不能有任何改动，也不能谈判。在所有这些协议中，阿斯莫德只想要一样东西：签署这些契约的角色永远放弃他们的灵魂。在签约的角色达到17级后，如果在任何时候他们死亡，他们的死亡是永久性的，没有机会从坟墓中返回。阿斯莫德带走他们的灵魂，使他们成为{@creature pit fiend}，永远为他服务。",
	"Mahadi can offer the following gifts in exchange for a soul contract:": "马哈迪可以提供以下礼物以换取灵魂契约。",

	"{@b Tiefling Transformation}. Asmodeus transforms the character into a {@race tiefling} with a direct infernal bloodline to him. Substitute the character's racial traits with {@race tiefling} racial traits.": "{@b Tiefling Transformation}. 阿斯莫德将角色转化为一个与他有直接的地狱血统的{@race tiefling}。用{@race tiefling}的种族特征取代该角色的种族特征。",
	"Zariel relies on Mahadi's services to provide supplies, magic items, and other items of value necessary for continuing her campaign in the Blood War. Infernal Rapture has also been known to host meetings or high-ranking devils as a neutral and private space.": "扎里尔依靠马哈迪的服务来提供物资、魔法物品和其他有价值的物品，以继续她在血战中的活动。无间狂欢也被称为主办会议或高级魔鬼，作为一个中立的私人空间。",
	"Mahadi is bound by contract with Asmodeus to not stage a coup in Avernus or directly assist others to do so. Nothing in the contract, however, states that Mahadi can't indirectly assist others in attempting to overthrow Zariel or whoever else is in control, either by imparting information or selling goods.": "马哈迪受与阿斯莫德签订的合同约束，不得在阿弗纳斯发动政变或直接协助他人这样做。然而，合同中并没有规定马哈迪不能间接协助他人试图推翻扎里尔或其他控制者，无论是通过传递信息还是出售货物。",
	"When {@creature Lulu|BGDIA} arrives at the Wandering Emporium, its tantalizing sights, sounds, and smells are dimly familiar to her. Mahadi seems more familiar to {@creature Lulu|BGDIA} than anything else in the emporium, but she can't remember why.": "当{@creature Lulu|BGDIA}到达 \"流浪帝王 \"时，其诱人的景象、声音和气味对她来说是模糊的。马哈迪对{@creature Lulu|BGDIA}来说似乎比商场里的任何东西都要熟悉，但她不记得为什么。",
	"Although {@creature Lulu|BGDIA} has no memory of any prior visit to the Wandering Emporium, Mahadi is happy to remind her that he sheltered {@creature Lulu|BGDIA} for a while after she became lost in Avernus. What Mahadi fails to mention is that, after earning her trust, he splashed {@creature Lulu|BGDIA} with water from the River Styx to strip her of her spellcasting abilities and memories. Mahadi then sold {@creature Lulu|BGDIA} to some devils who, in turn, delivered her back to Zariel.": "虽然{@creature Lulu|BGDIA}不记得以前来过流浪帝国，但马哈迪很高兴地提醒她，在{@creature Lulu|BGDIA}在阿弗纳斯迷路后，他曾庇护过她一段时间。但马哈迪没有提到的是，在赢得她的信任后，他用冥河的水泼了{@creature Lulu|BGDIA}，剥夺了她的法术能力和记忆。然后马哈迪把{@creature Lulu|BGDIA}卖给了一些魔鬼，这些魔鬼又把她送回了扎里尔。",
	"Mahadi is surprised to see {@creature Lulu|BGDIA} again but tries not to show it. He initially suspects that the hollyphant has come seeking revenge for the memory loss he inflicted upon her. Once he realizes that her intentions are benign, Mahadi pretends to be her friend once more.": "马哈迪对再次见到{@creature Lulu|BGDIA}感到惊讶，但尽量不表现出来。他最初怀疑冬青象是来为他对她造成的失忆进行报复的。一旦他意识到她的意图是善意的，马哈迪就再次假装是她的朋友。",
	"The Wandering Emporium travels on the backs of nine Huge infernal war machines similar to {@vehicle Demon Grinder|BGDIA|Demon Grinders}, but with Flamethrowers and Styx Sprayers instead of Chompers and Wrecking Balls.": "漫游帝国在九个巨大的地狱战争机器的背上旅行，类似于{@vehicle Demon Grinder|BGDIA|Demon Grinders}，但是用火焰喷射器和冥河喷射器代替了Chompers和Wrecking Ball。",
	"When {@creature Mahadi the Rakshasa|BGDIA|Mahadi} finds an adequate location to set up shop, he orders his drivers to form a horseshoe-shaped defensive perimeter. As the infernal war machines grind to a halt, their crews (comprised of indentured humans, {@creature duergar}, {@creature Hobgoblin||hobgoblins}, {@creature Salamander||salamanders}, {@creature Succubus||succubi}, {@creature Incubus||incubi}, and assorted other creatures) disembark and begin unpacking tents and whatnot. All shops are open within the hour and remain open for business until Mahadi decides it's time to pack up and move elsewhere.": "当{@creature Mahadi the Rakshasa|BGDIA|Mahadi}找到一个合适的地点安营扎寨时，他命令他的司机形成一个马蹄形的防御圈。当地狱般的战争机器停了下来，他们的船员（由契约人类、（1%）、（2%）、（3%）、（4%）、（5%）和其他各种生物组成）下了车，开始卸下帐篷和其他东西。所有的商店都在一小时内开张，并继续营业，直到马哈迪决定是时候收拾东西搬到其他地方去。",
	"If the characters come upon the Wandering Emporium while it's open for business, describe it to the players as follows:": "如果角色们在营业时遇到了 \"漂泊帝国\"，请向玩家描述它的情况如下。",
	"A collection of brightly colored tents stands clustered together, creating an oasis of comfort amid the dread landscape of Avernus. Huge infernal war machines form a horseshoe about the tents, with curtains made of small, rectangular iron plates and lamps dangling from chains strung between them. Soft, lilting music and wondrous smells drift across the hot winds, inviting a closer look.": "一批色彩鲜艳的帐篷簇拥着站在一起，在阿弗纳斯可怕的风景中创造了一片舒适的绿洲。巨大的地狱战争机器在帐篷周围形成了一个马蹄形，帘子是由小的、长方形的铁板制成的，灯在它们之间用链子吊着。柔和的音乐和奇妙的气味在热风中飘荡，吸引着人们仔细观察。",
	"The Wandering Emporium provides a haven for all who enter and is considered neutral ground for those that might otherwise initiate a conflict. A sign posted at the entrance, strangely understandable in all languages, simply states: \"All are welcome here. No fighting! No spellcasting!

	"Mahadi greets all visitors, directing them toward whatever establishments interest them the most while reserving the highest praise for his own beloved restaurant and spa, Infernal Rapture. There, he fulfills their every desire in an attempt to place them in his debt. If this doesn't work, he isn't averse to offering payment in exchange for services rendered. The characters are welcome to stay as long as they wish, until such time as Mahadi decides it's time to pack up and go elsewhere. Characters indebted to Mahadi can stay on with the Wandering Emporium, but only as his servants.": "马哈迪迎接所有的游客，引导他们前往他们最感兴趣的机构，同时对他自己心爱的餐厅和水疗中心 \"无间狂欢 \"保留了最高的赞誉。在那里，他满足他们的一切愿望，试图让他们欠下他的债。如果这不起作用，他也不反对用钱来交换所提供的服务。只要他们愿意，这些人物都可以留下来，直到马哈迪决定收拾行李去别的地方。欠马哈迪债务的人物可以继续留在 \"漂泊帝国\"，但只能作为他的仆人。",

	"As the owner and host of Infernal Rapture, Mahadi takes his responsibilities very seriously. Every patron that enters the demiplane that houses his establishment must sign an infernal contract. It presents a very simple arrangement stipulating that patrons must pay for everything consumed and all services used before they leave.": "作为 \"地狱狂欢 \"的老板和主人，马哈迪非常认真地对待他的责任。每个进入他的场所的顾客都必须签署一份无间道合同。它提出了一个非常简单的安排，规定顾客在离开之前必须为所有消费和使用的服务付费。",

If someone wanted to meet with creatures unable or unwilling to travel to the Nine Hells (or even just Avernus), this establishment provides a possible meeting location. Of course, entrance to the demiplane must be negotiated with Mahadi, with the promise of appropriate payment.": "由于 \"无间狂欢 \"存在于一个半位面，所以严格来说它并不在九层地狱。如果有人想与无法或不愿意前往九层地狱（甚至只是阿弗纳斯）的生物会面，这个机构提供了一个可能的会面地点。当然，进入半位面必须与马哈迪协商，并承诺给予适当的报酬。",

	"The dining menu at Infernal Rapture changes daily, providing a fixed-price selection. Sample menus are provided as player handouts in {@adventure appendix E|BGDIA|14}.

	"Special food requests can be filled, but they must be made weeks in advance and can be costly. Mahadi charges from five to ten {@item Soul Coin|BGDIA|soul coins} for an exotic request, depending on the difficulty involved in fulfilling it.

He seeks to take possession of such individuals and make them permanent residents of Avernus.": "专业服务包括梦想疗法、全身修复和长寿疗法，以及针对每一种胃口的大量服务，包括健康的和退化的。这些服务中的每一项都需要额外的费用（%0%）。马哈迪不断地、费力地以额外的费用向客户推销更多的服务。他试图占有这些人，并使他们成为Avernus的永久居民。",
	"This establishment is run by three {@creature Salamander||salamanders} named Rassh, Skids, and Slagg. The salamanders owe Mahadi a debt for taking them in and secreting them away after a bold escape from {@area Bel's Forge|251|x}.

	"The cackling demon lord shuts his maw and narrows his eyes, gazing up toward the sky as a beam of radiant light pierces the haze. A powerful angel streaks down from above, followed by a gold-furred mammoth with feathered wings. The angel slashes her sword across Yeenoghu's chest and utters a spell. A portal opens behind the demon lord as the mammoth rams its head into Yeenoghu. The demon lord is sent tumbling through the portal, which quickly closes behind him.": "咯咯笑的恶魔领主闭上嘴巴，眯起眼睛，抬头望向天空，一束璀璨的光刺破了雾霾。一个强大的天使从上面疾驰而下，后面跟着一只长着羽毛翅膀的金毛猛犸象。天使用她的剑划过叶诺古的胸膛，并念出一个咒语。当猛犸象把它的头撞向耶诺古时，恶魔领主身后打开了一个门户。恶魔领主被送进了传送门，传送门在他身后迅速关闭。",

One of these Hellriders, a woman in her thirties with a fresh, deep cut on her cheek, thanks the characters and introduces herself as Yael.

If the characters possess the {@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA}, they can free Gargauth as described in the item's description (see {@adventure Appendix C|BGDIA|12|{@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA}}).": "{@creature pit fiend} Gargauth最想做的就是被释放出监狱，取代Zariel成为Avernus的主人。如果人物拥有{@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA}，他们可以按照物品描述中的方法释放加加思（见{@adventure Appendix C|BGDIA|12|{@item Shield of the Hidden Lord|BGDIA}}）。",
	"If released, Gargauth thanks the characters through tears of mirth. The pit fiend's first act is to produce a contract out of thin air, claiming that it will aid the characters in their quest to destroy Zariel if they sign it. The contract is full of convoluted text, and is summarized in its final clause: \"I, the undersigned, agree to form a compact with Gargauth, joining with it to destroy the archdevil Zariel. While bound by this compact, no intentional harm shall befall either party by the other party's hand, without voiding this agreement.\"": "如果被释放，加加斯会通过欢笑的眼泪来感谢这些角色。坑魔的第一个行为是凭空产生了一份合同，声称如果他们签署了这份合同，它将帮助角色们完成消灭扎里尔的任务。契约中充满了错综复杂的文字，并在其最后条款中进行了总结。\"我，下面的签名者，同意与Gargauth签订契约，与它一起消灭大恶魔Zariel。在受此契约约束的同时，任何一方不得故意伤害另一方，否则本协议无效。\"",
	"Gargauth takes joy in subverting ill-worded contracts and betraying those bound by them. Notably, the contract presented lasts only until Zariel is destroyed, after which point Gargauth intends to tear the adventurers limb from limb. Clever adventurers can subvert the pit fiend's betrayal by ensuring Zariel's capture, banishment, or some other nonlethal defeat.": "加戈斯以颠覆言辞不当的契约和背叛受其约束的人为乐。值得注意的是，所提出的契约只持续到扎里尔被摧毁为止，之后加古斯打算把冒险家们的肢体撕碎。聪明的冒险者可以通过确保扎里尔被抓、被放逐或其他非致命性的失败来颠覆坑魔的背叛。",
	"In that event, though, Gargauth has left itself an easy out. The only consequence for harming an ally under the terms of the contract is the contract's immediate negation—leaving Gargauth free to do whatever it sees fit. The pit fiend hopes that it can sneak this ruse through unchallenged, and argues fiercely if the characters spot this tricky phrase and demand its removal from the contract.": "不过，在这种情况下，Gargauth给自己留下了一个简单的出路。根据合同条款，伤害盟友的唯一后果是合同被立即否定--让加尔古斯自由地做它认为合适的事情。坑魔希望它可以不受质疑地悄悄通过这个诡计，如果角色们发现这个棘手的短语并要求将其从合同中删除，它就会激烈地争辩。",
	"The queen of evil dragons is mighty and aloof, and she rarely acts unless her triumph is assured. Challenging an archdevil directly is risky, and {@creature Tiamat|RoT} stands to lose a great deal if Zariel prevails. Fortunately, Tiamat has a champion she can send in her stead: {@creature Arkhan the Cruel|BGDIA}.": "邪恶的龙后是强大而冷漠的，除非她的胜利得到保证，否则她很少采取行动。直接挑战一个大恶魔是很冒险的，如果扎里尔获胜，（%0%）会损失惨重。幸运的是，提亚马特有一个冠军，她可以派来代替她。{@creature Arkhan the Cruel|BGDIA}.",
	"The adventurers can't communicate with Tiamat directly, but they can approach Arkhan at his tower (see \"{@area Arkhan's Tower|247|x}\"). Arkhan is preoccupied with trying to find a way to free Tiamat from the Nine Hells while also staving off the physical deterioration caused by the {@item Hand of Vecna}. He won't entertain thoughts of vanquishing Zariel unless there's something in it for him and his dark queen.": "冒险家们不能直接与提亚马特交流，但他们可以在阿克汗的塔楼上接近他（见\"（%0%）\"）。阿克汗一心想要找到将提亚马特从九层地狱中解救出来的方法，同时还要避免{@item Hand of Vecna}造成的身体退化。除非对他和他的黑暗女王有好处，否则他不会有消灭扎瑞尔的想法。",
	"While the head of Zariel would be a grand trophy, a trophy isn't enough to sway Arkhan. The characters must convince him that he can rule Avernus in Zariel's stead, with Tiamat by his side and armies of abishai and infernal dragons at his back. After contemplating this notion, Arkhan raises the {@item Hand of Vecna} and boasts, \"With this hand, I shall tear Zariel's head from her shoulders and rule Avernus with my queen at my side.\"": "虽然扎里尔的头颅是一个伟大的战利品，但一个战利品并不足以动摇阿克汗。角色们必须说服他，他可以代替扎里尔统治阿弗纳斯，在他身边有提亚马特，在他背后有阿比沙和地狱龙的军队。在考虑了这个想法之后，阿克汗举起了{@item Hand of Vecna}，并吹嘘道：\"用这只手，我将把扎丽尔的头从她的肩膀上扯下来，在我的女王身边统治阿弗纳斯。\"",
	"Arkhan declares that he will muster an army and depose Zariel in ten days. Exactly ten days later, two hundred {@creature white abishai|MTF} fly from Arkhan's tower toward Zariel's current location, with Arkhan leading the charge on the back of Asojano the {@creature chimera}, and {@creature Torogar Steelfist|BGDIA} by his side, carried on the back of Chango the {@creature manticore}. Arkhan's army is bolstered by five chromatic dragons—one adult dragon of each color—sent by Tiamat to help ensure victory. If they so choose, the characters can join Arkhan. The abishai and the dragons engage Zariel's legions while Arkhan, Torogar, and the characters challenge the archdevil herself. This battle can play out as part of the \"{@area Endgame in Elturel|340|x}\" section described at the end of this chapter.": "阿克汗宣布，他将在十天内召集军队并废黜扎里尔。整整十天后，两百名{@creature white abishai|MTF}从阿克汗的塔中飞向扎里尔现在的位置，阿克汗在{@creature chimera}阿索亚诺的背上带头冲锋，{@creature Torogar Steelfist|BGDIA}在他身边，由{@creature manticore}昌戈背负。阿克汗的军队得到了提亚马特派来的五条色龙的支持，每条色龙都有一条成年龙，以帮助确保胜利。如果他们选择的话，人物可以加入阿克汗。阿比莎和龙与扎里尔的军团交战，而阿克汗、托罗格和人物则向大恶魔本人发起挑战。这场战斗可以作为本章末尾描述的\"{@area Endgame in Elturel|340|x} \"部分的一部分进行。",
	"The characters might decide after meeting Zariel that they wish to serve her, joining her army and smiting demons in the Blood War. They also might wind up serving her if they fail to redeem her and wish to live.": "人物在见到扎里尔后可能会决定为她服务，加入她的军队，在血战中消灭恶魔。如果他们没能救赎她并希望活下去，他们也可能最终为她服务。",
	"Characters who choose to serve Zariel must sign a contract (see {@adventure appendix A|BGDIA|10}) forfeiting their souls to the archdevil. She then returns such characters to the Material Plane to do her bidding. Zariel has numerous schemes spinning at any given time, but the adventurers are particularly well suited to preparing Baldur's Gate to meet the same fate as Elturel. As a sign of favor, she bestows a charm upon each character (see \"{@area Archdevil Charms|414|x}\").": "选择为扎里尔服务的角色必须签署一份合同（见（%0%）），将他们的灵魂交给大恶魔。然后她会将这些角色送回物质世界，听从她的命令。扎里尔在任何时候都有无数的计划，但冒险者们特别适合为博德之门准备与艾尔图勒一样的命运。作为恩惠的象征，她会在每个角色身上赐予一道符咒（见\"{@area Archdevil Charms|414|x}\"）。",
	"Characters who die in Zariel's service are reborn as {@creature Lemure||lemures} from the River Styx. They lose all memories of their previous lives, and their alignment changes to lawful evil. If a character pleased Zariel with their loyalty in life, she might allow them to keep their memories as she promotes them to an NPC devil of your determination.": "为扎里尔服务而死亡的角色会从冥河中重生为（%0%）。他们会失去所有关于前世的记忆，并且他们的取向会变成合法的邪恶。如果一个角色在生前的忠诚让扎里尔感到高兴，她可能会允许他们保留记忆，因为她会把他们提升为你所决定的NPC恶魔。",
	"With no one to sway Zariel from her path to absolute damnation, Zariel demands that the characters give her the {@item Sword of Zariel|BGDIA} if they possess it. After she claims the sword, Zariel holds it aloft and shatters it (see \"{@area Relinquishing the Sword|337|x}\").": "由于没有人可以动摇扎里尔的道路，扎里尔要求人物把{@item Sword of Zariel|BGDIA}交给她，如果他们拥有它。在她认领了这把剑之后，扎里尔高举着它并将其击碎（见\"{@area Relinquishing the Sword|337|x}\"）。",
	"For Zariel to fall beyond redemption is the worst outcome for {@creature Lulu|BGDIA}. This unimaginable tragedy shatters the hollyphant's mind, leaving {@creature Lulu|BGDIA} insane. Roll or choose the specific effects of her madness from the {@table long-term madness||Long-Term Madness table} in {@adventure chapter 8|DMG|-1} of the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, but this madness can be overcome only by a {@spell greater restoration} spell or similar magic.": "对于扎里尔来说，堕落到无法救赎的地步是{@creature Lulu|BGDIA}最糟糕的结果。这个难以想象的悲剧击碎了冬青象的心灵，让{@creature Lulu|BGDIA}变得疯狂。从{@adventure chapter 8|DMG|-1}的{@table long-term madness||Long-Term Madness table}中滚动或选择她疯狂的具体效果，但这种疯狂只能通过{@spell greater restoration}的咒语或类似的魔法来克服。",
	"If Zariel is redeemed or killed, the first layer of the Nine Hells falls into chaos. You can decide which of the many powerful figures in Avernus make a play to replace Zariel, but any new ruler immediately faces enemies on all sides. The invading armies of Baphomet and Yeenoghu are wreaking havoc and threatening to tear Avernus apart. Moreover, dozens of ambitious greater devils will gleefully try to supplant their new and untested ruler.": "如果扎里尔被赎回或被杀，九层地狱的第一层就会陷入混乱。你可以决定在Avernus的众多强势人物中，哪位可以取代扎里尔，但任何新的统治者都会立即面临四面楚歌。巴弗灭和耶诺古的入侵军队正在进行破坏，并威胁要将阿弗纳斯撕裂。此外，几十个野心勃勃的大魔王将欣喜地试图取代他们新的、未经考验的统治者。",
	"Ruling a layer of the Nine Hells as a mortal is effectively impossible. None of the devils of Avernus will knowingly serve anyone but a superior devil. However, Asmodeus admires ambition. The Lord of the Nine Hells might see a brash and powerful mortal as a worthy replacement for Zariel, offering to transform the character into an NPC archdevil that can rule Avernus. Alternatively, the characters might attempt to claim Avernus on their own terms.": "作为一个凡人，统治九层地狱的一层实际上是不可能的。没有一个阿弗纳斯的魔鬼会明知故犯地服务于任何人，除了一个高级魔鬼。然而，阿斯莫德欣赏野心。九层地狱之主可能会把一个粗鲁而强大的凡人看成是扎里尔的合格替代者，并提议把这个角色改造成一个可以统治阿弗纳斯的NPC大魔鬼。另外，这些人物可能会试图以自己的方式要求获得Avernus。",
	"Idealistic characters seeking to destroy the Nine Hells from the inside out might see this power vacuum as an opportunity to strike a mortal blow to Asmodeus's reign. This might be the only time in cosmic history that such a blindly idealistic cause could succeed. But even if the party can wrest Avernus from Asmodeus's control, this ultimately serves to unite the remaining archdevils, aligning them toward the common goal of reclaiming Avernus—which works to Asmodeus's advantage.": "追求从内到外摧毁九幽地狱的理想主义人物可能会将这一权力真空视为对阿斯莫德的统治进行致命打击的机会。这可能是宇宙历史上唯一一次这种盲目的理想主义事业能够取得成功。但是，即使该党能够从阿斯莫德的控制下夺回阿维纳斯，这最终也会使剩余的大恶魔们团结起来，使他们朝着夺回阿维纳斯的共同目标前进--这对阿斯莫德有利。",
	"Unless the characters intervene, Elturel is inevitably dragged into the River Styx. The memories of its inhabitants will be wiped clean, and their souls will be made into devils—fodder for the front lines of the Blood War.": "除非人物介入，否则Elturel将不可避免地被拖入冥河。这里居民的记忆将被抹去，他们的灵魂将成为血战前线的魔鬼炮灰。",
	"The characters have several ways to save the city at its most desperate hour (see \"{@area Endgame in Elturel|340|x}\"). To save Elturel without redeeming Zariel, the chains binding the city to the infernal iron posts sinking into Avernus must be severed, and the city must be returned to the Material Plane.": "在城市最危急的时刻，角色们有几种方法来拯救城市（见\"（%0%）\"）。要拯救Elturel而不救回Zariel，必须切断将城市与沉入Avernus的地狱铁柱绑在一起的锁链，而且必须将城市送回物质界。",
	"At some point after the destruction of the {@item Sword of Zariel|BGDIA}, Zariel gives her servants (including the characters if they have taken on that role) the task of forging a new blade for her. This endeavor comes with the following objectives:": "在{@item Sword of Zariel|BGDIA}被摧毁后的某个时刻，扎里尔给她的仆人（包括角色，如果他们承担了这个角色的话）一个任务，为她锻造一把新刀。这项工作有以下目标。",
	"If {@creature Bel|BGDIA} is still in Zariel's service, she calls on him to forge the blade. Otherwise, her servants must scour the cosmos for a worthy weaponsmith, such as an efreeti from the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire.": "如果{@creature Bel|BGDIA}仍在为扎里尔服务，她会要求他锻造这把刀。否则，她的仆人们必须在宇宙中寻找一个有价值的武器工匠，比如来自火元素位面的黄铜之城的伊夫里提。",
	"Zariel needs at least ten pounds of metal or material to make the blade of the sword. Adamantine would do, or a talon from Tiamat.": "扎里尔需要至少10磅的金属或材料来制作剑刃。金刚石也行，或者来自提亚马特的爪子。",
	"To grant the blade its power, the freshly forged weapon must be quenched in the blood of a celestial, a demon lord, and an archdevil. Zariel can supply her own blood, but her servants must collect the other two sacrifices.": "为了赋予这把刀以力量，新锻造的武器必须在一位天人、一位恶魔领主和一位大恶魔的血液中淬炼。扎丽尔可以提供她自己的血，但她的仆人必须收集其他两个祭品。",
	"Zariel names this new artifact the {@item Blade of Avernus|BGDIA}.": "扎里尔将这个新的神器命名为（%0%）。",
	"Eight chains of infernal iron anchor Elturel to its binding posts, and each of those chains must be broken to free the city. If all the chains are broken, Elturel remains floating above Avernus and is no longer drawn toward the River Styx. However, the characters must still find a way to return the city to the Material Plane.": "八条地狱铁链将Elturel固定在捆绑的柱子上，每条铁链都必须被打破才能使城市获得自由。如果所有的铁链都被打破，Elturel将继续漂浮在Avernus之上，不再被吸引到冥河。然而，角色们仍然必须想办法将城市送回物质界。",
	"Each chain link is 30 feet long and 20 feet wide, and is formed of a welded loop of infernal iron that is 5 feet thick.

See {@adventure chapter 2|BGDIA|2} for information on moving along the chains and climbing the infernal iron posts they connect to.": "每个链环有30英尺长，20英尺宽，由5英尺厚的地狱铁焊接而成。链环是一个巨大的物体，AC值为19，命中率为250，伤害阈值为30，对中毒和精神伤害免疫。关于沿着链子移动和爬上它们所连接的地狱铁柱的信息，请参见（%0%）。"
