	"Something evil is trapping the souls of the dead and draining life from all who have been raised from death by magic.

	"{@i Tomb of Annihilation} is a Dungeons & Dragons adventure that takes place on the peninsula of Chult in the Forgotten Realms. Chult is a tropical wilderness composed mostly of jungles, plateaus, impassable mountains, and belching volcanoes. You can substitute a different jungle setting, changing location names as needed.

	"The characters are drawn into the story by {@creature Syndra Silvane|ToA}, a retired adventurer and merchant who, years ago, was raised from the dead. Now, she's withering away. When she consulted priests, Syndra learned that the affliction was widespread and that no spell could cure it. She spoke to her friends among the Harpers, who determined the source of the affliction: an ungodly necromantic device called the Soulmonger. The Harpers received their intelligence from a lich, but they don't know much about the Soulmonger other than its name and general whereabouts. Adventurers willing to help Syndra must travel to Chult, a land of jungles and monsters, to find the Soulmonger and destroy it.": "人物被{@creature Syndra Silvane|ToA}吸引到故事中，她是一个退休的冒险家和商人，多年前，她从死里复活。现在，她正在枯萎。当她咨询牧师时，辛德拉了解到这种痛苦很普遍，而且没有任何法术可以治愈它。她与她在哈珀人中的朋友交谈，他们确定了这种痛苦的来源：一种被称为 \"灵魂使者 \"的不敬神的死灵装置。哈珀人从一个巫师那里得到了他们的情报，但是他们除了知道它的名字和大致的位置之外，对灵魂制造者并没有什么了解。愿意帮助辛德拉的冒险者必须前往丘特，一个充满丛林和怪物的地方，找到灵魂使者并摧毁它。",
	"Unknown to Syndra and her allies, the Soulmonger is trapping the souls of the dead and depriving liches of the means to trap souls in their phylacteries. (The Soulmonger snatches up the souls before they can be trapped elsewhere.) Szass Tam, the most powerful lich among the Red Wizards of Thay, has sent operatives to Chult to steal the Soulmonger or, failing that, destroy it.

	"Also lurking in the heart of Chult is {@creature Ras Nsi|ToA}, a mythic, villainous figure among Chultans. {@creature Ras Nsi|ToA} was a human paladin and a sworn protector of the city of Mezro. He betrayed his oaths and was banished. Rather than redeem himself, he raised an undead army to conquer Mezro. The would-be tyrant was defeated and banished once more. Mezro was later destroyed by the Spellplague (or so it seemed), during which {@creature Ras Nsi|ToA} lost his power to create and command undead. He withdrew to the city of Omu, leaving the vestiges of his undead army to roam unchecked throughout the jungle. That was not the end of {@creature Ras Nsi|ToA}, however. Bitter over his loss of power, he forged an alliance with the yuan-ti lurking in the ruins of Omu and underwent a ritual of transformation, becoming a yuan-ti malison. As a yuan-ti, {@creature Ras Nsi|ToA} imposed his terrible will on the evil snake people and became their leader.": "潜伏在楚尔特中心的还有{@creature Ras Nsi|ToA}，他是楚尔特人中一个神话般的恶棍人物。{@creature Ras Nsi|ToA}是一个人类的圣骑士，也是梅斯罗城的宣誓保护者。他背叛了自己的誓言，被放逐。他没有自我救赎，而是组建了一支亡灵军队来征服梅兹罗。这位可能的暴君被击败，并再次被放逐。Mezro后来被法术瘟疫摧毁了（似乎是这样），在这期间（2%）失去了创造和指挥亡灵的能力。他撤回了奥姆城，留下他的亡灵军队的残余在丛林中肆意游荡。然而，这并不是{@creature Ras Nsi|ToA}的终点。他对失去权力感到痛苦，于是与潜伏在奥穆城废墟中的元帝结成联盟，并经历了一场改造仪式，成为元帝的马利森。作为元帝，{@creature Ras Nsi|ToA}将他可怕的意志强加给邪恶的蛇人，成为他们的领袖。",

Omu is also home to the Tomb of the Nine Gods. As the characters explore this multilevel dungeon, they encounter the spirits of Omu's trickster gods and are potentially inhabited by them. Each god embodies a different alignment, and any character inhabited by one gains a special power as well as a flaw. The nine trickster gods don't get along, and they try to push one another out of the characters' bodies. As the gods fight over their living hosts, the characters must deal with the deadly traps and monsters that guard the Soulmonger. Venturing deeper into the tomb, they uncover clues about the dungeon's evil architect—the archlich {@creature Acererak|ToA}—and learn that the Soulmonger is feeding souls to an undead horror called an atropal. Once it consumes enough souls, the atropal will transform into an evil god.": "在奥木龟裂的街道下，有一座秘密的元神庙，名为 \"夜蛇之窗\"，在那里，%0%的人控制着局面，谋划着世界末日。奥木也是九神之墓的所在地。当人物探索这个多层次的地牢时，他们会遇到奥姆的诡计多端的神灵，并有可能被他们所占据。每个神都体现了不同的方向，任何被其附身的角色都会获得一种特殊的力量和缺陷。这九个恶作剧之神并不和睦，他们试图把对方从人物的身体里挤出去。在众神争夺他们的活体宿主时，角色们必须对付守卫着灵魂之门的致命陷阱和怪物。在深入墓穴的过程中，他们发现了关于地牢邪恶建筑师的线索--Archlich {@creature Acererak|ToA}--并了解到Soulmonger正在将灵魂喂给一种叫做atropal的不死恐怖。一旦它吞噬了足够的灵魂，阿托帕尔就会变成一个邪恶的神。",
	"Destroying the Soulmonger ends the death curse affecting the world, while killing the atropal incurs the wrath of {@creature Acererak|ToA}.

As with other XP awards, the amount should be divided evenly among all party members.": "你可以通过扣留XP，\"储存 \"它，直到你准备好让队伍升级，来减缓等级提升的速度。相反，你可以通过为发现、完成目标、良好的角色扮演、生存或避开致命的陷阱而授予临时的XP来加速等级的提升。任何这样的特别奖励都不应该超过人物打败挑战等级与他们等级相同的怪物所获得的奖励。例如，对于一个由2级冒险者组成的队伍来说，一个公平的特别奖励是450XP，这就是角色们打败一个挑战等级为2的怪物所能获得的。与其他XP奖励一样，这个数额应该在所有党员中平均分配。",
	"As the DM, you can dispense with XP tracking and allow characters to gain levels at whatever pace suits your campaign, using the Suggested Character Levels table as your guide.": "作为DM，你可以免除XP追踪，允许角色以适合你的活动的任何速度获得等级，以建议的角色等级表作为指导。",
	"Chult is loaded with fun distractions, alluring locations, and opportunities for characters to explore. Consequently, it can be hard to gauge what level the characters will be when they arrive at adventure locations. Again, let the Suggested Character Levels table guide you. For example, if the characters are 4th level and about to stumble into Omu ({@area chapter 3|1d6|x}), you might want to steer them in a different direction, throw random encounters at them until they've reached 5th level, advance them to 5th level automatically, or adjust encounters in Omu to make the threats easier toovercome.": "Chult充满了有趣的分心，诱人的地点，以及让角色探索的机会。因此，当人物到达冒险地点时，可能很难判断他们的等级。同样，让建议的角色等级表来指导你。例如，如果角色是4级，即将偶然进入Omu({@area chapter 3|1d6|x})，你可能想把他们引向一个不同的方向，在他们达到5级之前向他们抛出随机的遭遇，使他们自动提升到5级，或者调整Omu的遭遇，使威胁更容易克服。",
	"Although the adventure assumes that the characters begin at 1st level, you can start them off at 5th level or 9th level instead.": "虽然这个冒险假定角色从1级开始，但你可以从5级或9级开始。",
	"Characters of 5th level will still find parts of chapters 1 and 2 challenging. If an encounter becomes too much of a cakewalk, you can introduce enemy reinforcements. Hold off on XP awards and level advancement until the characters reach Omu in chapter 3.": "五级的角色仍然会发现第一和第二章的部分内容具有挑战性。如果一个遭遇变得太容易了，你可以引入敌人的增援。暂停XP奖励和等级提升，直到角色到达第三章的Omu。",
	"Characters of 9th level will steamroll through chapters 1 and 2, and that's fine. Spend less time on encounters in the jungle, and steer the characters toward Omu as quickly as possible. Once they arrive, run the adventure as you normally would. Characters at this level will still be challenged by chapters 3 and 4, particularly if you play the yuan-ti as intelligent adversaries. Hold off on XP awards and level advancement until the characters enter the Tomb of the Nine Gods in chapter 5.": "9级的角色会在第1章和第2章中大展拳脚，这很好。少花点时间在丛林中的遭遇战上，并尽快引导人物向奥姆前进。一旦他们到达，就像平常那样进行冒险。这个级别的人物仍然会受到第三章和第四章的挑战，特别是如果你把元老扮演成聪明的对手。在人物进入第五章的九神之墓之前，暂缓XP奖励和等级提升。",
	"The adventure's default starting location is the city of Baldur's Gate on the Sword Coast, in the Forgotten Realms setting. However, any large settlement will do.

Victims grow thinner and weaker each day, slowly but steadily sliding toward the death they once denied. When they finally succumb, they can't be raised—and neither can anyone else, regardless of whether they've ever received that miracle in the past. Temples and scholars of divine magic are at a loss to explain a curse that has affected the entire region, and possibly the entire world.": "在过去的几天里，街道和酒馆的话题都是关于所谓的死亡诅咒：一种折磨着所有曾经从死里复活的人的消耗性疾病。受害者一天比一天瘦弱，缓慢而稳定地滑向他们曾经否认的死亡。当他们最终屈服时，他们无法复活--其他人也无法复活，无论他们在过去是否曾获得过这种奇迹。神圣魔法的寺庙和学者们对影响整个地区，甚至可能影响整个世界的诅咒束手无策。",

	"The Batiri invented battle stacks as a way to combat creatures much larger than themselves as well as a way to reach enemies in trees.

	"All the city's water comes from rain, so every building has a cistern or wooden barrels to catch water running off the roof. Every public square is built around a fountain or rain basin. With so much water running downhill, Chultans also make excellent use of water-driven mechanical gadgets. Many buildings have water wheels built into their cisterns. Rainwater running through spouts or channels turns the wheel, which pumps water into pools, turns millstones, powers bellows or lathes or saws, or accomplishes any other labor-saving or amusing task Chultan engineers can dream up.": "该市所有的水都来自于雨水，因此每栋建筑都有一个蓄水池或木桶来接住从屋顶流出的水。每个公共广场都围绕着一个喷泉或雨盆而建。由于有这么多的水从山上流下来，丘尔特人也很好地利用了水驱动的机械装置。许多建筑物的蓄水池里都有水轮。雨水流经水口或渠道，使水轮转动，水轮将水抽入水池，转动磨石，为风箱或车床或锯子提供动力，或完成苏丹工程师能想到的任何其他省力或有趣的任务。",

	"1. Collect a Debt. K'lahu (N female Chultan human {@creature thug}), a bookie who takes bets at Executioner's Run (see {@area area 2|036|x}), asks the adventurers to come with her as she collects a debt. The pay is 10 percent of whatever is collected on the 500 gp debt, which is owed by a man named Taban (N male Chultan human {@creature gladiator}). Taban refuses to pay anything until he's beaten down to 20 or fewer hit points, whereupon he offers up a pouch containing ten 50 gp gemstones.

	"2. Create a Distraction at Fort Beluarian. Rokah (N male Chultan human {@creature spy}) works for the Zhentarim. The Zhents believe that pirates have formed an alliance with the Flaming Fist. Rokah has orders to infiltrate Fort Beluarian and find proof so that the Zhentarim can blackmail the fort's commander. He asks the adventurers to escort him safely to the fort and create a distraction so that he can ransack the commander's quarters. As a reward, Rokah offers to cover the cost of a charter of exploration (50 gp), which the characters will almost certainly need if they want to avoid future confrontations with the Flaming Fist. Rokah also offers to introduce the characters to two wilderness guides—a pair tabaxi siblings named {@creature River Mist|ToA} and {@creature Flask of Wine|ToA} (see \"{@area Finding a Guide|08f|x}\")—and pay the guides' fees.": "2. 在贝卢安堡制造一个分心点。罗卡（N位男性苏丹人（%0%））为振特人工作。镇特人认为海盗已经与火焰之拳结成联盟。罗卡奉命潜入贝卢安堡，找到证据，以便振塔林可以勒索堡垒的指挥官。他要求冒险者们护送他安全到达堡垒，并制造一个分散注意力的机会，以便他能洗劫指挥官的住所。作为奖励，罗卡提议支付探索特许权的费用（50戈比），如果他们想避免将来与火焰之拳的对抗，几乎肯定需要这个费用。罗卡还提议把人物介绍给两个野外向导--一对名叫{@creature River Mist|ToA}和{@creature Flask of Wine|ToA}的塔巴西兄妹（见\"{@area Finding a Guide|08f|x}\"），并支付向导的费用。",
	"3. Escort a Priest to Camp Vengeance. Undril Silvertusk (LG female half-orc {@creature priest} of Torm with {@sense darkvision} out to a range of 60 feet) is a representative of the Order of the Gauntlet and newly arrived in Port Nyanzaru. She needs to deliver herself plus a packet of dispatches from her superiors to Commander {@creature Niles Breakbone|ToA} at Camp Vengeance. Undril was led to believe she could simply buy a horse in the city and ride to the camp, but now that she sees the terrain and conditions, that's clearly not possible. She hopes to join any expedition headed up the River Soshenstar. Undril is quite attached to her chain shirt, but she's not unreasonable when presented with good arguments for shedding the armor. If characters gain Undril's respect, she'll intercede strongly on their behalf if any difficulties arise with Commander Breakbone (as they're likely to, as discussed in {@area chapter 2|0cd|x}).": "3. 护送一名牧师到复仇营。Undril Silvertusk(LG女半兽人{@creature priest}，Torm的{@sense darkvision}范围为60英尺)是高塔骑士团的代表，刚到尼安扎鲁港。她需要把自己和一包上级的派遣信交给复仇营的指挥官{@creature Niles Breakbone|ToA}。Undril认为她可以简单地在城里买一匹马，然后骑到营地，但现在她看到了地形和条件，这显然是不可能的。她希望能加入任何沿索申星河而上的探险队。恩德勒相当重视她的链子衬衫，但如果有好的理由让她脱掉盔甲，她也不是无理取闹。如果角色获得了Undril的尊重，如果他们与Breakbone指挥官之间出现任何困难（正如{@area chapter 2|0cd|x}中所讨论的那样，他们很可能会出现这种情况），她会为他们进行强有力的斡旋。",
	"4. Explore the Aldani Basin. Inete (LG female Chultan human {@creature acolyte} of Savras) has had disturbing visions of red-robed wizards operating a secret base somewhere in the Aldani Basin. The head of her temple, {@creature Grandfather Zitembe|ToA}, has too many other things on his mind, but he's given Inete permission to investigate. Inete would like to accompany the characters' expedition for safety, if characters are heading toward or through that region. She'll provide her own food and supplies, and \"donate\" another 100 gp to the expedition's expenses. She insists on stopping by the temple of Savras to gather her belongings and urges the characters to come along. If they do, the characters can meet {@creature Grandfather Zitembe|ToA} (see {@area area 7|03c|x}).": "4. 探索阿尔达尼盆地。伊内特（萨维斯的LG女苏丹人（%0%））有一个令人不安的幻觉，那就是红袍巫师在阿尔达尼盆地的某个地方经营一个秘密基地。她的寺庙的负责人（%%）有太多的其他事情要考虑，但他允许Inete去调查。为了安全起见，Inete愿意陪同人物的探险，如果人物要前往或经过该地区的话。她会提供自己的食物和补给，并 \"捐献 \"100金币作为探险队的费用。她坚持要在Savras神庙前停留，以收集她的物品，并敦促角色们一起去。如果他们这样做了，角色们就可以见到{@creature Grandfather Zitembe|ToA}（见{@area area 7|03c|x}）。",

A half-elf named {@creature Xandala|ToA} (see {@adventure appendix D|ToA|9}) approaches the characters and claims to be {@creature Artus Cimber|ToA}'s daughter.

Artus can't be found using magic, but {@creature Xandala|ToA} has heard that Artus left the city with a reptilian man who doesn't talk and smells funny. Both were last seen heading into the jungle. {@creature Xandala|ToA} wants the {@item Ring of Winter|ToA} in Artus's possession, but she doesn't share this with the characters. Summerwise, {@creature Xandala|ToA}'s pet {@creature pseudodragon}, thinks the quest for the ring is too dangerous but has given up trying to talk sense into its mistress.

He recently bought some dancing monkey fruit on the black market and used them to make and sell dye. Shortly thereafter, he received an iron token from the Ytepka Society—a grim warning. He wishes to atone for his crime and seeks an audience with Kwayothé, the merchant prince who controls the legal sale of fruit. Fearing for his life, Omala asks the adventurers to accompany him to Goldenthrone (see {@area area 4|039|x}), where he plans to beg for Kwayothé's forgiveness. He has no money to offer the characters as a reward. Kwayothé is willing to forgive Omala's lapse in judgment provided the characters agree to kill a man named {@creature Shago|ToA} within the next 10 days—no questions asked—and speak of the deed to no one. Kwayothé tells them that {@creature Shago|ToA} works as a guide out of Fort Beluarian. If the characters fail in this task, Kwayothé has Omala sentenced to Executioner's Run (see {@area area 2|036|x}) for his crime.": "6. 帮助一个染色人。奥玛拉（N男Chultan人（%0%））是染料厂（23区）的一个染色大师。他最近在黑市上买了一些舞猴果，用它们来制作和销售染料。此后不久，他收到了来自Ytepka协会的铁质令牌--一个严峻的警告。他希望为自己的罪行赎罪，于是求见控制水果合法销售的商人王子Kwayothé。由于担心自己的生命安全，Omala要求冒险者们陪他去Goldenthrone（见{@area area 4|039|x}），他打算在那里乞求Kwayothé的宽恕。他没有钱可以提供给这些人物作为奖励。克瓦约特愿意原谅奥玛拉的失误，但条件是人物同意在接下来的10天内杀死一个叫{@creature Shago|ToA}的人--不问任何问题，并且不向任何人提起此事。Kwayothé告诉他们，{@creature Shago|ToA}在Beluarian堡外做向导。如果角色们没有完成这个任务，卡瓦依特会让奥玛拉因其罪行而被判处死刑（见{@area area 2|036|x}）。",

Lerek Dashlynd (LN male Illuskan human {@creature spy}), an agent of the Lords' Alliance, offers to trade a sailing ship for an accurate map of Chult that shows the exact location of the ruins of Nangalore and Orolunga. Lerek represents wealthy Waterdhavian interests, and the offer is genuine. If the characters present such a map, Lerek has a cleric cast {@spell augury} before agreeing to buy it, to make sure he's not buying a fake. Once he's convinced that the map is genuine, Lerek arranges to have the promised ship arrive in 10 days.": "7. 帮助领主联盟。Lerek Dashlynd（LN男性Illuskan人（%0%））是领主联盟的代理人，他提出用一艘帆船换取一张精确的楚尔特地图，该地图显示了Nangalore和Orolunga遗址的确切位置。莱克代表着富裕的沃特达威人的利益，而且这个提议是真实的。如果人物出示了这样的地图，在同意购买之前，Lerek会让一个牧师施展{@spell augury}，以确保他没有买到假货。一旦他确信地图是真的，Lerek就会安排承诺的船只在10天内到达。",

Belym (LG male Chultan human {@creature commoner}) is distraught because his husband, Draza (LG male Chultan {@creature commoner}), has been sentenced to Executioner's Run for stealing. Belym asserts that his husband was a victim of mistaken identity and sentenced without a proper hearing or trial. He's been unable to persuade anyone in authority that Draza is innocent. He'll give the characters 25 sp (all his savings) if they can help Draza from the sidelines so he survives the run.

Eshek (NG male Chultan human {@creature acolyte} of Savras) stumbles up to the characters in the street and whispers, \"Speak to the wise guardian of Orolunga, east of Mbala. She can direct you to that which you seek.\" Then he collapses, {@condition unconscious}. When he awakens moments later, Eshek has no memory of the last 12 hours aside from a driving need to find people matching the characters' descriptions.

Moments of such high peril provide a perfect opportunity for bystanders to become heroes in the city and earn favors from the merchant princes.": "偶尔有一只动物设法跃出或爬出坑，在惊恐的人群中乱跑。这种高度危险的时刻为旁观者提供了一个完美的机会，让他们成为城市中的英雄，并赢得商人王子的青睐。",
	"An enormous sinkhole serves as the city's garbage dump. Every type of refuse gets tossed here, up to and including dead bodies. It's a festering scar of garbage, rancid water, and vermin. Rats, insects, and ravens abound. {@creature Ghoul||Ghouls} are sometimes seen prowling through the pit in search of fresh corpses.": "一个巨大的天坑是这个城市的垃圾场。每种类型的垃圾都被扔在这里，甚至包括尸体。这是一个由垃圾、馊水和害虫组成的溃烂的疤痕。老鼠、昆虫和乌鸦比比皆是。(有时会看到有人在坑里徘徊，寻找新鲜的尸体。",
	"Although the level of refuse in the pit rises and falls, the pit never gets full. This is thanks to an unknown number of {@creature Otyugh||otyughs} living at the bottom and eating their fill daily. They're content to remain in the bountiful pit, but they'd quickly pounce on anyone careless or unlucky enough to slip on the greasy edge and fall in.": "虽然坑里的垃圾水平不断上升和下降，但坑里永远不会满。这要归功于数量不详的{@creature Otyugh||otyughs}住在底部，每天吃饱。它们满足于留在丰饶的坑里，但它们会迅速扑向任何粗心或不幸运地在油腻的边缘滑倒而掉入的人。",
	"The western half of the city is called the Merchants' Ward because it's the site of the Grand Souk and because many of the merchant princes' villas are there. In general, this is the upper-class section of the city. The majority of the city's merchants and traders actually live and work in the Market Ward.": "城市的西半部被称为商人区，因为它是大苏克的所在地，也因为许多商人王子的别墅在那里。一般来说，这里是城市的上层地区。城市的大多数商人和贸易商实际上在市场区生活和工作。",
	"This palace serves as the meeting place for the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru and is recognized as the seat of the city's loose government. It was built decades ago by an Amnian trader and is one of the most opulent structures in the city, rivaled only by the grander temples and the merchant princes' villas. An honor guard of eight Chultan {@creature Gladiator||gladiators} is always on duty, to keep away loiterers in the daytime and thieves in the night.": "这座宫殿是尼安萨鲁港的商人王子们的聚会场所，并被公认为该市松散政府的所在地。它是几十年前由一位阿米尼亚商人建造的，是城市中最富丽堂皇的建筑之一，只有更宏伟的寺庙和商人王子们的别墅可以与之媲美。一个由八名苏丹（%0%）组成的仪仗队总是在执勤，以防止白天的游荡者和夜间的小偷。",
	"Goldenthrone is the best place to meet any of the merchant princes without an appointment. They rarely meet with visitors who show up unannounced at their homes. During the day, each merchant prince has a 1-in-6 chance to be at Goldenthrone, accompanied by a retinue of aides and guards. Characters must wait {@dice 1d3} hours before being given an audience. In fact, the merchant princes have few day-to-day responsibilities when it comes to running Port Nyanzaru, so unless a meeting is being held to discuss city business, the delay is just a tactic to underscore who's in charge. If the characters have interesting news, they're likely to obtain an audience and to be given as much of the merchant's time as they need.": "Goldenthrone是在没有预约的情况下见到任何一位商人王子的最佳地点。他们很少会见那些突然出现在他们家里的访客。在白天，每个商人王子都有六分之一的机会出现在Goldenthrone，并有一个由助手和卫兵组成的随行人员陪同。角色必须等待{@dice 1d3}个小时才能被接见。事实上，在管理尼安萨鲁港方面，商人王子们几乎没有什么日常的责任，所以除非是在开会讨论城市事务，否则拖延只是一种强调谁是负责人的策略。如果这些人物有有趣的消息，他们就有可能获得接见，并获得商人所需的大量时间。",
	"Each merchant prince has a private villa in the city. These residences have beautifully plastered walls adorned with bright murals, patios and arcades festooned with fresh flowers, garden courtyards open to the sky, and enormous cisterns equipped with water wheels to power fountains, fans, and kinetic sculptures.": "每位商人王子在城里都有一栋私人别墅。这些住宅都有漂亮的石膏墙，上面装饰着明亮的壁画，天井和拱廊上摆放着新鲜的鲜花，花园庭院向天空开放，巨大的蓄水池配备有水轮，为喷泉、风扇和动态雕塑提供动力。",
	"None of the merchant princes is likely to meet player characters who show up unannounced at their doors unless the characters did something noteworthy (such as winning a dinosaur race, stopping a rampaging carnivore, or completing an expedition that made significant discoveries).

Business begins before the sun comes up, and dealing doesn't stop until well after darkness edges across the city. It's a noisy, jostling, aroma-rich circus. Guards are numerous, but less numerous than the urchins and pickpockets. Street performers and tabaxi minstrels add to the cacophony. Colorful awnings protect the market from sun and rain but also trap the heat and smells.": "来自剑海岸上下的商人来到这个市场，购买木材、香料、丛林植物制成的药物、恐龙头骨和爪子、铁、老虎皮、雕刻的象牙、巴蒂里和格隆的手工艺品、彩色羽毛、热带水果、猴子、长颈龙肉，以及楚尔特的所有其他财富。生意在太阳升起之前就开始了，直到整个城市陷入黑暗之后，交易才会停止。这是一个嘈杂的、打闹的、香气四溢的马戏团。警卫很多，但没有顽童和扒手多。街头艺人和Tabaxi吟游诗人为这一喧嚣增添了不少乐趣。五颜六色的遮阳篷为市场遮挡阳光和雨水，但也阻挡了热量和气味。",
	"Everything listed in {@book chapter 5|PHB|4} of the {@i Player's Handbook} can be purchased in the Grand Souk.

	"Savras is a deity of wizards, fortune tellers, diviners, and those who unfailingly speak the truth regardless of whether listeners want to hear it.

The tiled roof of its great dome resembles an unblinking eye, staring skyward.": "萨弗拉斯是巫师、算命师、占卜师以及那些无论听众是否想听都不折不扣地说出真相的神。他的象征是一只怪异的眼睛，或一个充满眼睛的水晶球。萨弗拉斯的神庙是该市最古老、最宏伟的建筑之一。其大圆顶的瓦片屋顶就像一只不眨眼的眼睛，盯着天空。",
	"A deity devoted to revealing the truth might seem to have a weak draw in a city of merchants, but Savras was widely worshiped in Chult long before the Spellplague. In those years, Savras's clergy were valued because they could keep tabs on the activities of the inscrutable yuan-ti. The snake people still loom large as bogeymen in the imaginations of Chultans, but nowadays the clergy of Savras scries into more mundane matters: portents around business affairs, the outlook for newborn children, and affairs of the heart.": "一个致力于揭示真相的神灵在一个商人聚集的城市似乎吸引力不大，但早在法术瘟疫之前，萨弗拉斯就在楚尔特受到广泛的崇拜。在那些年里，萨弗拉斯的神职人员很受重视，因为他们可以监视那些难以捉摸的元老的活动。蛇人在丘特人的想象中仍然是巨大的妖怪，但如今萨弗拉神职人员对更多的世俗事务进行调查：围绕商业事务的预兆、新生儿的前景以及心灵事务。",
	"The head priest of the temple is {@creature Grandfather Zitembe|ToA} (LG male Chultan human {@creature priest}).

The Zhents have come to the temple to see if Zitembe can cast a spell to aid in their search. Although the assassins offer payment in the form of a 500 gp ruby, Zitembe senses their evil intentions and shoos them away. The assassins seem hesitant to leave without satisfaction, but the arrival of the characters changes their minds, and they depart with scowls on their faces. The characters' timely arrival makes Zitembe predisposed to help them.": "寺庙的首席牧师是（%0%）（LG男性Chultan人（%1%））。当人物第一次见到牧师时，他正与三个寻找（%%3%）的振特人（NE男性Tethyrian人（%%2%））进行激烈的对话。振特们来到神庙，想看看齐坦贝是否能施展法术来帮助他们寻找。虽然刺客们提供了500金币的红宝石作为报酬，但Zitembe感觉到了他们的邪恶意图，并将他们赶走。刺客们似乎对不满意就离开犹豫不决，但人物的到来改变了他们的想法，他们带着鄙夷的表情离开了。这些人物的及时到来使Zitembe倾向于帮助他们。",
	"If he's approached for aid or advice in tracking down the Soulmonger, Zitembe's first reaction is to express disbelief that the death curse has anything to do with Chult. If characters give a compelling argument or make a donation to the church of at least 25 gp, Zitembe agrees to \"consult the guides.\" This ritual takes 24 hours, during which Zitembe sees visions of \"a jungle city far to the south, enclosed by cliffs and crawling with snakes\" and \"a black obelisk draped in vines.\" He dared not peer any deeper, but he urges the characters to seek out this city and the obelisk.": "如果有人向他寻求帮助或建议来追踪灵魂使者，齐坦贝的第一反应是表示不相信死亡诅咒与楚尔特有任何关系。如果人物给出了令人信服的论据，或者向教堂捐赠了至少25金币，齐坦贝就会同意 \"咨询向导\"。这个仪式需要24小时，在此期间，齐坦贝看到了 \"远在南方的丛林城市，被悬崖围住，爬满了蛇 \"和 \"被藤蔓缠住的黑色方尖碑 \"的幻觉。他不敢再深入探究，但他敦促人物去寻找这座城市和方尖碑。",
	"The boxy stone temple of Gond looms behind the royal docks. It's popular among Port Nyanzaru's many artisans, craftspeople, smiths, ivory carvers, and hydro-engineers. Where most such temples have a forge as a centerpiece, this one features an immense fountain whose water jets shift continually to create amazing shapes. It's all done with nozzles and valves moving on cams, driven by the city's plentiful water pressure.": "贡德的方形石庙在皇家码头后面隐约可见。它在尼安扎鲁港的许多工匠、手工艺人、铁匠、象牙雕刻家和水力工程师中很受欢迎。大多数这样的寺庙都以锻造为中心，而这座寺庙的特点是有一个巨大的喷泉，其水柱不断变换，创造出惊人的形状。所有这些都是通过在凸轮上移动的喷嘴和阀门完成的，由城市充足的水压驱动。",

	"The jewel market is intentionally styled as a miniature, more exclusive version of the Grand Souk. Its chief business is buying and selling the rich supply of jewels that are dug out of Chult's mines, but many other rare luxury items are also traded here. This market is largely secure against pickpockets and thieves, thanks to the privately hired security agents patrolling it openly ({@creature Guard||guards}) and undercover ({@creature Spy||spies}). All of them work for the merchant prince {@creature Zhanthi|ToA}, who has a monopoly on the jewelry trade in Port Nyanzaru.": "珠宝市场被有意设计成一个微型的、更独特的大苏克的版本。它的主要业务是买卖从楚尔特的矿场挖出的丰富的珠宝，但也有许多其他稀有的奢侈品在这里交易。这个市场在很大程度上是安全的，可以防止扒手和小偷，这要归功于私人雇佣的保安人员在这里公开（{@creature Guard||guards}）和暗中（{@creature Spy||spies}）巡逻。他们都为商人王子（%2%）工作，他垄断了尼安扎鲁港的珠宝贸易。",

She is one of the city's most influential residents after the merchant princes, and she enjoys tremendous support from every layer of society for the temple's charitable work and for its support of civic improvements. In fact, the temple is also one of the city's richest banks.

Dozens of small bathhouses across the city operate like private clubs, but the public bathhouse is open to everyone and is run by the priesthood of Sune (see {@area area 9|03e|x}). It's both egalitarian and elegant: wealthy merchants and dock laborers rub elbows in the tiled baths and marble-floored changing rooms. There is no charge, but bathers are requested to leave a donation to the temple of Sune befitting their station in life.

	"Along with cleanliness, Chultans love colorful clothing. Textile weaving is not one of Chult's native industries, because the jungle isn't suited for growing cotton or raising sheep. However, the jungle and the sea provide everything necessary to concoct vibrant dyes in a rainbow of colors. Merchants import light, plain fabrics, which are dyed in vibrant colors and patterns at the dye works before being sold locally or exported back to the regions where the cloth originated. Local tailors craft the fabric into the long shirts, knee-length pants, sarongs, and kilts favored in Port Nyanzaru.": "除了清洁，楚尔特人还喜欢五颜六色的衣服。纺织业不是楚尔特的本土产业之一，因为丛林不适合种植棉花或饲养绵羊。然而，丛林和海洋提供了一切必要的条件，可以调制出彩虹般鲜艳的染料。商人进口轻薄的素色织物，在染坊染成鲜艳的颜色和图案，然后在当地销售或出口到布的原产地。当地裁缝将这些布料加工成尼安扎鲁港人喜欢的长衬衫、过膝长裤、纱笼和千里马。",

The availability of sanctions doesn't mean they're common—it's rare for more than six to be sold in a year.

A handsome reward awaits those who can definitively pinpoint the pirates' base or capture their ships.": "Ytepka协会在从外国势力手中解放尼安萨鲁港和促进七位商人王子的崛起方面发挥了作用。它的成员现在不知疲倦地工作，防止Zhentarim和其他可疑的派别接管政府或获得不适当的影响。Ytepkas也在秘密工作，以消除来自海盗的威胁，但他们一直无法找到海盗的基地，也无法追踪城市中的海盗间谍。一个丰厚的奖励在等待着那些能够明确指出海盗基地或捕获其船只的人。",
	"Currently there are fewer than fifty active members of the Ytepka Society. They don't advertise their membership but identify one another using a simple hand gesture: a raised left hand with the index finger, middle finger, and third finger extended, representing the three horns of the triceratops.": "目前，Ytepka协会的活跃成员不到50人。他们不宣传自己的会员资格，但用一个简单的手势来识别彼此：举起左手，伸出食指、中指和三指，代表三角龙的三个角。",
	"When the society judges that someone has damaged the social fabric of Chult or is on the verge of committing a great wrong, it presents a warning by anonymously delivering an iron token bearing the likeness of a triceratops. It's up to the marked individual to figure out the meaning of the token and take steps to correct the offending behavior or undo the damage. If the person ignores the warning and persists in offending the society, the Ytepkas secure permission from the merchant princes to mete out punishment as they see fit, up to and including a sanction (see the \"{@area Laws and Punishments|07a|x}\" sidebar earlier in this chapter).": "当社会判断有人破坏了楚尔特的社会结构或即将犯下大错时，它就会以匿名的方式送上印有三角龙肖像的铁质令牌来发出警告。这取决于被标记的个人是否能弄清楚令牌的含义，并采取措施纠正违规行为或消除损害。如果这个人无视警告并坚持冒犯社会，Ytepkas会从商人王子那里获得许可，以他们认为合适的方式进行惩罚，包括制裁（见本章前面的\"（%0%）\"边栏）。",
	"Unfortunately, because of the society's secretiveness, not many people understand what those iron tokens signify, and there's a lot of misinformation about the Ytepkas in Port Nyanzaru. The society doesn't recollect its tokens, either, so unscrupulous types have used old (or even counterfeit) tokens to frighten competitors away from business ventures.": "不幸的是，由于该协会的保密性，没有多少人了解这些铁质令牌的含义，而且在尼安扎鲁港有很多关于Ytepkas的错误信息。该协会也不记得自己的令牌，所以不择手段的人用旧的（甚至是伪造的）令牌来吓唬竞争对手，使其放弃商业投资。",

Its members pursue wealth and power through any means, though the public face of the organization appears much more benign—the Zhentarim provides the best mercenaries money can buy.": "镇塔林是一个不择手段的影子网络，它试图在整个法鲁恩扩大其影响力和权力基础。其成员不择手段地追求财富和权力，尽管该组织的公开面孔看起来要善良得多--Zhentarim提供金钱可以买到的最好的雇佣兵。",

The Black Network has used this wide-ranging access to the city to set up its own woodcutting camps and mining operations. It also mounts treasure-hunting expeditions. In addition, Black Network spies have learned that {@creature Artus Cimber|ToA} is in Chult, and they've assembled teams to find the ex-Harper and wrest the {@item Ring of Winter|ToA} from him.": "尼安扎鲁港的商人王子们雇佣Zhentarim卫兵来保卫城墙，雇佣Zhentarim雇佣兵来保护丛林和山脚下的狩猎、伐木和采矿作业。黑色网络利用这种广泛的进入城市的机会，建立了自己的伐木营地和采矿作业。它还发动了寻宝探险活动。此外，黑网的间谍已经得知{@creature Artus Cimber|ToA}在楚尔特，他们已经组建了团队来找到前哈珀并从他那里夺取{@item Ring of Winter|ToA}。",

	"The only alternative to buying specialty items through the merchant princes is to deal with the black market, which is highly secretive in Port Nyanzaru; the merchant princes crack down harshly on competitors. Contacting black marketeers takes half a day in the Old City, Malar's Throat, or Tiryki Anchorage, plus a successful DC 15 Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check to pose the right questions to the right people at the right time. To determine the black market price of an item, multiply the item's normal price (see the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} where appropriate) by {@dice 1d4 + 2}. If an unusually large quantity is needed, increase the price multiplier by 1.": "除了通过商人王子购买特殊物品外，唯一的选择是与黑市打交道，在尼安萨鲁港，黑市是高度保密的；商人王子对竞争者进行严厉打击。联系黑市商人需要在老城、马拉尔之喉或提里基锚地花上半天时间，再加上成功通过DC15魅力({@skill Deception})检查，在正确的时间向正确的人提出正确的问题。要确定一件物品的黑市价格，将该物品的正常价格（见适当的{@book Player's Handbook|PHB}）乘以{@dice 1d4 + 2}。如果需要的数量异常大，则将价格乘数增加1。",

It's up to you as the DM to be flexible and keep the story moving forward as best you can. If an encounter is going badly for the adventurers, you can have the monsters suddenly withdraw, demand the party's surrender, or deal nonlethal damage. You can have an NPC show up to lend assistance. Mindless predators might be scared off by a sudden volcanic eruption or earth tremor. In short, there is always a way to turn the party's misfortune into a fighting chance of survival.": "Chult是一个冒险之地，本章旨在使人物的荒野之旅成为一个令人难忘的旅程。根据设计，冒险地点并不是为特定等级的角色量身定做的。如果冒险队伍的实力相对较弱，那么就要看玩家们如何选择是逃跑而不是战斗，是谈判而不是攻击，还是投降而不是死亡。这取决于你作为管理人是否灵活，并尽可能地使故事向前发展。如果一场遭遇战对冒险者来说很糟糕，你可以让怪物突然撤退，要求队伍投降，或者造成非致命伤害。你可以让一个NPC出现，提供帮助。无意识的掠食者可能会被突然的火山爆发或地动山摇所吓跑。简而言之，总有一种方法可以将队伍的不幸变成生存的机会。",
	"The sections that follow contain information that will help you run this part of the adventure smoothly. For each day that the party travels through the wilderness, follow these steps:": "下面的章节包含的信息将帮助你顺利地进行这部分的冒险。在队伍穿越荒野的每一天，都要遵循这些步骤。",

They can travel 2 hexes per day if they're traveling by canoe on a river or lake. The rate of travel up or down river is the same; the rivers are so sluggish that current is almost imperceptible. Without canoes, the normal rate of travel along a river is the same as through the surrounding terrain. Canoes move 1 hex per day through swamp.": "在楚尔特的地图上，每个六面体的宽度为10英里。以正常速度行进的角色每天可以在沿海、丛林、山地、沼泽或荒地的地形中步行1个六角。如果他们乘坐独木舟在河流或湖泊中旅行，每天可以走2个六角。沿河而上或沿河而下的速度是一样的；河流是如此的缓慢，水流几乎是难以察觉的。在没有独木舟的情况下，沿河行驶的正常速度与通过周围地形的速度相同。独木舟在沼泽中每天移动1个六角。",
	"If characters move at a fast pace, the easiest way to deal with their progress is to roll a {@dice d4}. On a roll of 3 or 4, they advance 1 additional hex that day. Characters moving at a fast pace take a–5 penalty to their passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) scores, making them more likely to miss clues and walk into ambushes.": "如果角色的移动速度很快，处理他们的进展的最简单方法是掷出（%0%）。在掷出3或4的时候，他们当天会额外前进1个六角。快速移动的角色在他们的被动智慧（（%1%））得分上受到5分的惩罚，这使得他们更有可能错过线索和走进伏击。",
	"If characters set a slow pace, roll a {@dice d4}. On a roll of 1 or 2, they advance 1 fewer hex that day (in other words, 1 hex by canoe or none by foot).

As long as they're not in the open, they can try to surprise or sneak by other creatures they encounter.": "如果角色设定了一个缓慢的步伐，就掷一个{@dice d4}。如果掷出1或2，他们当天就会少前进1个爻位（换句话说，用独木舟前进1个爻位，或用步行不前进）。如果是其他的结果，他们的谨慎就会得到奖励，并且他们会和以正常速度前进的队伍走同样的距离。以慢速行进的角色可以隐蔽地移动。只要他们不在空旷的地方，他们就可以尝试出其不意或偷偷摸摸地通过他们遇到的其他生物。",
	"Instead of tracking movement by hexes, you can keep track of the actual distances covered (10 miles per day at a normal pace, 15 miles per day at a fast pace, or 9 miles per day at a slow pace), but this is likely to be more bother than it's worth if the group switches pace from day to day.": "你可以记录实际的运动距离（正常速度每天10英里，快速度每天15英里，或慢速度每天9英里），而不是按六边形跟踪运动，但如果小组每天都转换步伐，这可能会造成更多的麻烦。",

The likelihood of an undead encounter increases in territories marked with red skull-and-bones icons. Most guides know these territories well. Where undead are concerned, traveling by river is safer than traveling by land, both because undead are poor swimmers at best and because it's easier to pour on speed in canoes and escape across the water than to flee through tangled jungle.": "亡灵生物几乎将人类文明赶出了半岛，只有几个孤立的前哨站，楚尔坦人和他们的盟友在墙后避难。地图2.1显示了亡灵最密集的地方。角色经过标有黑色骷髅图标的地区时，有可能会随机遇到亡灵。在标有红色骷髅图标的地区，遇到亡灵的可能性会增加。大多数向导对这些地区非常熟悉。就亡灵而言，走河道比走陆路更安全，这是因为亡灵充其量不过是个差劲的游泳者，也因为用独木舟加快速度逃过水面比逃过纠结的丛林更容易。",

	"Shown in map 2.2, Ataaz Muhahah (\"Laughing Gorge\") is a gaping chasm crossed by an ancient stone span called the Monkey Bridge.

Most of the carvings have been damaged by time, but the skilled artistry remains apparent.": "如地图2.2所示，Ataaz Muhahah（\"大笑峡\"）是一个巨大的鸿沟，由一个古老的石桥横跨，称为猴桥。这个结构的名字来自于栖息在桥壁上的猴子，它们的尾巴挂在桥底。这些猴子是活的猴子和古代雕刻的混合体，是桥的一部分。大多数雕刻已经被时间破坏，但熟练的艺术手法仍然很明显。",
	"The living monkeys chatter and shriek continually, and the gorge echoes with the sound of their cries. Occasionally, the echoes from up and down the gorge overlap in a way that transforms the cacophony into haughty, gloating laughter. When that happens, the terrified monkeys fall silent for several minutes as the \"laughter\" dies away before resuming their chatter.": "活泼的猴子们不断地唠叨和尖叫，峡谷里回荡着它们的叫声。偶尔，来自峡谷上下的回声重叠在一起，将喧闹的声音变成了傲慢的、幸灾乐祸的笑声。当这种情况发生时，受惊的猴子们在 \"笑声 \"消失后会沉默几分钟，然后再继续它们的喋喋不休。",

	"A human skeleton lies crumpled near the statue's feet. Several of its bones are obviously broken, but it's impossible tell whether these injuries happened while the person was alive or were caused by scavengers after death.": "一具人类骨架皱巴巴地躺在雕像的脚边。它的几根骨头明显断裂，但无法判断这些伤是在人活着的时候发生的，还是死后被拾荒者造成的。",
	"The statue is, in fact, a {@creature stone golem} created to defend the bridge against ancient invaders. It attacks anyone who desecrates it (including trying to remove its eye gems, which are purely decorative and worthless), who damages the bridge, or who passes the shrine without making the proper obeisance to Ubtao. The required homage involves placing a fingertip at the center of one of the bridge's mazelike carvings and tracing an unbroken path past the statue. Guides who are natives of Chult would know this. The symbolic labyrinths aren't terribly complex; the biggest difficulty comes from the lichens and moss growing over them. If these are cleared away with a knife or other tool before tracing the maze, it can be traced properly with a successful DC 5 Intelligence check. If it's not cleaned first, the DC increases to 10.

However, Yokka had a vision of a treasure inside the shrine that could make him a great figure in his tribe, so he and his followers have spent the last tenday trying to work up the courage to tackle the shrine's traps. The arrival of adventurers is a great boon from Yokka's point of view. If they defeat the shrine's traps, he can simply take its treasure from them as they emerge.

	"Although she's a villain of sorts, {@creature Liara Portyr|ToA} has no reason to be an enemy to the characters.

	"The main reason adventurers have for visiting Fort Beluarian is to buy a \"charter of exploration.\" Baldur's Gate lays claim to everything east of the Mistcliff and north of Kitcher's Inlet, and now that Mezro is picked clean, it's trying to extend its claim south to Refuge Bay. No one (including the merchant princes of Port Nyanzaru) has the force in Chult to dispute this claim. So within its territory, the Flaming Fist does as it pleases, including demanding that explorers buy charters. A charter grants permission to the holder to explore Chult and plunder its riches, but half of an expedition's proceeds and discoveries must be turned over to the Flaming Fist. The charter costs 50 gp, which is treated as a down payment on the split of profits. In addition, those who buy a charter can hire up to six Flaming Fist mercenaries ({@creature Guard||guards}) to accompany them for the very reasonable rate of 1 gp per tenday each. It's easy enough to launch an expedition from Port Nyanzaru without a charter. The only risk is that if a Flaming Fist patrol runs into an expedition without a charter, it will attack the expedition and confiscate its gear.": "冒险家们访问贝卢安堡的主要原因是为了购买一份 \"探索宪章\"。博德之门对雾崖以东和基特尔湾以北的一切都提出了要求，现在梅斯罗已经被摘除，它正试图将其要求向南扩展到避难湾。没有人（包括尼安扎鲁港的商人王子）在楚尔特有足够的力量来质疑这一主张。因此，在其领土内，火焰之拳为所欲为，包括要求探险者购买特许证。许可证允许持有者探索楚尔特并掠夺其财富，但探险队的一半收益和发现必须上交火焰之拳。包租费用为50戈比，这被视为利润分成的首付款。此外，购买包机的人可以雇佣最多6名火焰之拳的雇佣兵（（%0%））随行，费用非常合理，每人每小时1金普。从尼安萨鲁港出发进行远征，不需要包租，这很容易。唯一的风险是，如果火焰之拳的巡逻队遇到没有租约的探险队，它将攻击探险队并没收其装备。",

If they complete the mission, the characters are given free meals and guest rooms (see area 10J) whenever they visit Fort Beluarian, and each character receives one potion or scroll chosen from the ones available in the stores (see area 10G).": "Portyr要求角色们起航前往Shilku湾，对被摧毁的Shilku村进行为期一周的侦察，并返回Beluarian堡报告他们的所见所闻。如果人物接受了这个任务，波蒂尔会支付他们的食物和旅费，并给他们一个免费的探索章程。如果他们完成了任务，只要他们访问贝鲁里安堡，就会得到免费的膳食和客房（见10J区），并且每个角色都会得到一个从商店（见10G区）中挑选的药水或卷轴。",
	"Flaming Fist scouts have spotted giant footprints south of Fort Beluarian. If the characters find out who or what is making the tracks, and discover where they're coming from and what threat (if any) they pose to Fort Beluarian, Portyr will reward them with five magic arrows (see area 10G). If the characters accept the mission, Portyr gives the party a free charter of exploration. To complete the mission, the characters must locate at least one group of frost giants as well as their longship (see \"{@area Hvalspyd|12b|x}\"). To complicate matters, Portyr doesn't believe any report that claims frost giants have landed in Chult and won't pay up unless the characters back up their claims with compelling evidence (such as a frost giant's severed head or a giant-sized weapon).": "火焰之拳的侦察员在贝鲁里安堡南部发现了巨大的脚印。如果角色们找到了制造这些脚印的人或物，并发现它们来自哪里，以及它们对贝鲁里安堡构成了什么威胁（如果有的话），波蒂尔将奖励他们五支魔法箭（见区域10G）。如果角色们接受了这个任务，波蒂尔会给他们一个自由探索的章程。为了完成任务，角色们必须至少找到一群冰霜巨人以及他们的长船（见\"（%0%）\"）。更为复杂的是，波特不相信任何声称冰霜巨人在楚尔特登陆的报告，除非人物用令人信服的证据（如冰霜巨人的头颅或巨大的武器）来支持他们的说法，否则不会付钱。",
	"The fort provisioner, or sutler, is a store that serves the soldiers of the Flaming Fist exclusively. It doesn't have much variety and the prices aren't great, but some elements of the garrison appreciate its \"no civilians allowed\" policy.

The store is run by a sharp-tongued old man named Jaro (NG male Chultan human {@creature commoner}).": "堡垒供应者，或称苏特勒，是一家专门为火焰之拳的士兵服务的商店。它的品种不多，价格也不高，但驻军中的一些人很欣赏它的 \"平民不得入内 \"政策。它在白天出售基本的生活用品，晚上提供食物和饮料。这家店是由一个尖嘴猴腮的老人经营的，他叫贾罗（NG男性苏丹人（%0%））。",

	"On particularly stifling nights, many soldiers abandon the barracks and sling hammocks in the guard towers. The breeze atop the walls provides some cooling and relief from insects.": "在特别闷热的夜晚，许多士兵放弃军营，在岗楼上挂起吊床。城墙顶上的微风提供了一些凉爽，并缓解了昆虫的困扰。",
	"This bastion is a fort within a fort. The bailey is 20 feet tall at the peak of the roof, and the attached palisade is 16 feet high, so the whole structure can be seen from outside Fort Beluarian. The gates are always open unless the fort is under attack or patrols have reported unusual amounts of undead in the neighborhood. In the event that the outer wall is breached and the main enclosure overrun, the garrison would retreat to this redoubt for its final defense.": "这个堡垒是一个堡垒中的堡垒。堡垒的屋顶顶点有20英尺高，附属的围墙有16英尺高，所以从贝卢安堡外就可以看到整个结构。除非堡垒受到攻击或巡逻队报告附近有不寻常数量的亡灵，否则大门总是开着的。如果外墙被攻破，主围墙被攻破，驻军就会撤退到这个红堡进行最后的防御。",

A boardwalk is installed around the courtyard, so people don't need to walk in the mud when rain pours down.": "贝利的中央庭院是向天空开放的。它可以用厚重的大门封住，甚至由少数士兵进行坚固的防御。院子周围安装了一条木板路，这样人们就不需要在大雨滂沱的时候在泥泞中行走。",

	"The head trainer for the fort's reptiles is Rahl Zuberi (CG male human Chultan {@creature tribal warrior} with {@skill Animal Handling} +4). His face and arms are covered in tattoos and scars, and he's missing half of his right hand; tooth marks are still clearly visible in the scar tissue.

	"The great hall of the bailey is where most of the fort's military business is conducted, and where {@creature Liara Portyr|ToA} (see {@adventure appendix D|ToA|9}) meets important visitors.

	"This ruined yuan-ti city stands in the jungle at the foot of the Crown, a fuming volcano that marks the western end of the Sky Lizard Mountains.

Many of the serpent folk who once dwelled here have since relocated to Omu.": "这座废墟般的元老级城市矗立在皇冠山脚下的丛林中，皇冠山是一座冒烟的火山，标志着天蜥山脉的西端。一个类似于{@spell antipathy/sympathy}法术的强大防护装置阻止元帝进入这个城市。许多曾经居住在这里的蛇人后来都迁到了奥姆。",
	"The earth swallowed half of the city, which rests in a sprawling underground cavern that has never been warmed by the sun.

Their spokesperson is blunt-talking Sithi Vinecutter. She lays out the problem (\"firenewts have taken over our ancestral forge\") and proposes the solution (\"kill them\"). As a reward, each character will be allowed to take twenty 1-pound ingots of refined adamantine from the forge, and the dwarves will lead them to the location of a crashed \"flying boat\" from some far-off land (see \"{@area Wreck of the Star Goddess|1aa|x}\").": "如果角色在锻造厂的10英里（1个六角）范围内旅行，四个（%0%）（见（%1%））发现并接近他们。他们的发言人是直言不讳的西蒂-维纳特。她提出了问题（\"火蝾螈占领了我们的祖传锻造厂\"）并提出了解决方案（\"杀死它们\"）。作为奖励，每个角色将被允许从锻造厂带走20个1磅重的精制金刚砂锭，而矮人将带领他们去找一个从遥远的地方坠落的 \"飞行船 \"的位置（见\"{@area Wreck of the Star Goddess|1aa|x}\"）。",

	"When the forge was operated by the dwarves, it was linked by trade roads to Shilku Bay and other points on the peninsula. Although those roads have endured a century of neglect, in the vicinity of the forge they were of dwarven construction, and not even a century of disrepair can erase a dwarven road. The roads are buried under ash in the Valley of Lost Honor, but where the mountains rise above the ash plain, the road can be spotted easily and followed to the forge entrance.

	"A cavern of molten magma bubbles and flames before you. The cavern walls are lined with metal gantries and cranes that support immense crucibles of scorched clay. Huge chains stretch across the cavern, apparently to shuttle multi-ton buckets of ore across the lava. The heat takes your breath away, brings water to your eyes, and bakes your skin. From where you stand, the only obvious way across is via a narrow stone trestle built for rail carts. The sound of rhythmic hammering comes from somewhere beyond the magma rift.": "在你面前有一个熔融岩浆的洞穴，冒着气泡和火焰。洞壁上有金属门架和吊车，支撑着巨大的焦土坩埚。巨大的链条横跨洞穴，显然是为了将数吨重的矿石桶穿梭于熔岩之中。热量让你喘不过气来，让你的眼睛进水，让你的皮肤发烫。从你站立的地方看，唯一明显的途径是通过一条为轨道车建造的狭窄的石头栈道。有节奏的敲击声来自岩浆裂缝之外的某个地方。",

The lower lock was originally embedded in a golden frame in the shape of a stylized dwarven rune for \"endings,\" but the firenewts scraped away the gold and used it to decorate their shrine to Imix ({@area area 7|125|x}).

Once the adamantine fragment is picked out, a more careful search turns up a second fragment of gold, so thoroughly hammered that it's barely recognizable.

	"The roof of the cave looms 60 feet above the water, on average (this varies a bit with the tide). It's 50 feet above ground level and 20 feet above the top of the watch tower and gantry.

If it fails by 4 or less, the ship strikes a rock and springs a few leaks but suffers no serious damage and can continue seeking a passage through. If the check fails by 5 or more, a rock causes significant damage; the ship lists badly and its speed is halved until the hull is repaired. Striking a third rock causes the ship to sink. The pirates, of course, know where the rocks are and avoid them.": "海盗们的第一道防线是距离海岸四分之一英里的一圈水下岩石。试图驶过的船只的船长必须进行DC10智力检查。如果检查成功，船就能安全通过岩石。如果失败4次或更少，船就会撞到岩石，并出现一些漏水现象，但不会受到严重损害，可以继续寻求通过的途径。如果检查的结果是5分或更多，那么一块岩石就会造成严重的损坏；船体严重变形，速度减半，直到船体被修复。撞击第三块岩石会使船沉没。海盗们当然知道岩石的位置，并会避开它们。",

	"Each of the three captains has one of these chambers for his private use. In practice, the captains seldom use them, preferring the comfort and safety of the cabins aboard their own ships. Instead, the use of these private quarters is meted out as a reward to crew members who distinguished themselves on the latest voyage, and as a result, they tend to be squalid and smelly.": "三位舰长中的每一位都有一个这样的房间供其私人使用。实际上，船长们很少使用这些房间，他们更喜欢自己船上的舒适和安全的船舱。相反，这些私人房间的使用是作为对在最近一次航行中表现突出的船员的奖励，因此，这些房间往往是肮脏和发臭的。",

The weapons hooked on the walls remain where they are.": "如果任何生物在没有三叉戟的情况下穿过帘子，水就会爆发出一股猛烈的波浪，向南向北流动。在这两个大厅里的任何生物都会被水冲击，并且必须做一个DC15的力量救赎动作。如果蓄力失败，该生物会受到14（（%0%））的重击伤害，并被巨大的力量冲到大厅的尽头，从而跌落（%1%）。蓄力成功的生物会受到一半的伤害并跌落（%2%），但不会被卷走。钩在墙上的武器保持原位。",
	"Water expelled by the curtain disappears before it can flow beyond the confines of the hallways. The water also does not enter either of the hidden alcoves (area 31A), so creatures there are safe from the waves' effect.": "帘子排出的水在流过走廊的范围之前就消失了。水也不会进入任何一个隐藏的凹槽（31A区），所以那里的生物不会受到波浪的影响。",
	"The water conjured by the curtain leaks out of the hall through tiny cracks in the floor, leaving puddles behind.": "窗帘幻化出的水通过地板上的微小裂缝漏出大厅，留下水坑。",
	"Any character searching for traps or secret doors in this tunnel notices a narrow seam in the stonework with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check. This seam marks one end of a 25-foot-long section of crawlway (marked \"Tunnel A\" on map 5.3) that rotates. If the check succeeds by 5 or more, the character can deduce that the seam represents a point where two sections of tunnel can detach from one another.": "任何在这条隧道中寻找陷阱或秘密门的角色，只要成功通过DC15智慧（（%0%））检查，就能注意到石缝中的一条窄缝。这条缝标志着一段25英尺长的爬行道（在地图5.3上标记为 \"隧道A\"）的一端，这段爬行道可以旋转。如果检定成功5个或更多，这个人物就可以推断出这条缝代表了两段隧道可以相互分离的一个点。",
	"When 50 pounds or more of weight is applied to the floor at the midpoint of tunnel A, a mechanism causes the tunnel to quickly rotate 90 degrees clockwise and sink 5 feet as it turns. Both ends of the tunnel are immediately cut off, trapping creatures inside. At the same time, a second crawlway perpendicular to the first (marked \"Tunnel B\" on map 5.3) rotates 90 degrees clockwise and sinks into place, positioned where tunnel A used to be. Characters who are flying, in gaseous form, or otherwise effectively weightless do not trigger the trap and can move through the tunnel safely.": "当50磅或更多的重量被施加到隧道A的中点的地板上时，一个机制使隧道迅速顺时针旋转90度，并在转动中下沉5英尺。隧道的两端立即被切断，将生物困在里面。同时，第二条垂直于第一条的爬行通道（在地图5.3上标为 \"隧道B\"）顺时针旋转90度并下沉到位，位置在隧道A原来的位置。处于飞行、气态或其他有效失重状态的角色不会触发陷阱，可以安全通过隧道。",
	"Read the following text to players the first time their characters are caught in a rotating tunnel:": "当玩家的角色第一次被卷入旋转隧道时，向他们阅读以下文字。",
	"With a loud grinding noise, this section of crawlway begins to rotate, instantly cutting off the exits ahead and behind. You can feel the passage sink about five feet as it turns. After a few seconds, it comes to a stop and the grinding abates.": "随着一声巨大的磨擦声，这段爬行道开始旋转，瞬间切断了前面和后面的出口。你可以感觉到通道在转动时下沉了大约五英尺。几秒钟后，它停了下来，磨擦声减弱。",
	"When tunnel B connects to the rest of the crawlway, a new passage running north to south is formed. Tunnel B is trapped similarly to tunnel A, except that both tunnels ascend 5 feet as they rotate 90 degrees counterclockwise when the trap triggers. The only way to return tunnel A to its original position is to trigger the trap from tunnel B, and vice versa.": "当隧道B与其余的爬行通道连接时，就会形成一条由北向南的新通道。隧道B的陷阱与隧道A类似，只是当陷阱触发时，两个隧道都逆时针旋转90度，上升了5英尺。让隧道A回到原来位置的唯一方法是从隧道B触发陷阱，反之亦然。",
	"Characters trapped in a section of tunnel not connected to the rest of the crawlway have no clear means of escape. The tunnel is airtight. A single creature consumes the available air supply in 24 hours, with multiple creatures dividing that time up between them. For example, four creatures trapped in the tunnel could survive 6 hours before they begin to suffocate.": "角色被困在一段不与其他爬行通道相连的隧道中，没有明确的逃生途径。这条隧道是密闭的。一个生物在24小时内就会消耗掉可用的空气供应，而多个生物则会把这个时间分给他们。例如，四个被困在隧道里的生物在开始窒息之前可以生存6个小时。",
	"Any character who can see into tunnel B notices the body of an unlucky adventurer.": "任何能看到隧道B的角色都会注意到一个倒霉的冒险家的尸体。",
	"As a new tunnel rotates into place, you see a skeletal corpse lying on the floor of that tunnel, about ten feet away.": "当一条新的隧道旋转到位时，你看到一具骷髅的尸体躺在那条隧道的地板上，大约十英尺远。",
	"The corpse belongs to Sephirius, dragonborn paladin of the Company of the Yellow Banner. Looting the body reveals several items of interest (see \"Treasure\" below).": "这具尸体属于黄色旗帜公司的龙裔圣骑士塞菲留斯。掠夺尸体会发现一些有趣的物品（见下文 \"宝藏\"）。",
	"Sephirius wore no armor but carried a {@item +1 yklwa} (see \"{@area Buying a Special Item|084|x}\" in chapter 1 for more information on this weapon), a dungeoneer's pack, a pouch containing 8 gp, an ivory back scratcher shaped like a dinosaur claw (25 gp), a holy symbol of Bahamut (25 gp), and a red crystal eyeball measuring 1 inch in diameter.": "Sephirius没有穿盔甲，但携带了一把{@item +1 yklwa}(关于这种武器的更多信息，请参见第一章的\"{@area Buying a Special Item|084|x}\")、一个地下城主的背包、一个装有8戈比的小袋子、一个象牙背刮器，形状像恐龙爪(25戈比)、一个巴哈姆特的神圣符号(25戈比)，以及一个直径1英寸的红色水晶眼球。",
	"The nonmagical crystal eye is one of the ten keys needed to open the vault of the beholder ({@area area 44|414|x}).": "非魔法的水晶眼是打开看守者的金库所需的十把钥匙之一（（%0%））。",
	"This chamber contains a stone font filled with a steaming green liquid. Beyond it, a shadowy figure stands at an open door on the far side of the room. The figure's back is toward you.": "这个房间里有一个石制的字体，里面装满了冒着热气的绿色液体。在它之外，一个朦胧的身影站在房间远处一扇打开的门前。这个人的背对着你。",
	"The stone font is attached to the floor and can't be tipped over. It is also impervious to damage and spells. It appears to hold 40 pints (5 gallons) of hot soup, but the liquid is illusory. Tactile exploration reveals that the liquid has no substance and the font is dry.": "石头字体附着在地板上，不能被翻倒。它也是不受损害和法术影响的。它似乎可以容纳40品脱（5加仑）的热汤，但这些液体是虚幻的。触觉探索显示，液体没有实体，字体是干的。",
	"The dark figure is a magical, illusory duplicate of whichever character opened the door to the room. It copies the character's movements, allowing a shrewd player to use the duplicate to dispense with the liquid in the font. The shadow duplicate has the statistics of a {@creature commoner} and is immune to poison damage. It perfectly matches the motions of the character who created it, always keeping its back to its creator as though it was a projected image 15 feet ahead.": "这个黑影是一个神奇的、虚幻的复制体，是打开房间门的哪个角色的复制体。它复制了该人物的动作，使精明的玩家可以利用这个复制品来免除字体中的液体。影子复制品具有{@creature commoner}的统计数据，对毒药伤害免疫。它与创造它的人物的动作完全一致，总是背对着它的创造者，就像它是一个前方15英尺的投影画面。"
