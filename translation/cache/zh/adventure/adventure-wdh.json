	"A simple question began rattling around in my head over two years ago as I was bidding farewell to Barovia, dragging myself out of the depths of Maelstrom, and planning a yearlong expedition to Chult. Where do we go next? After mulling over several options, we decided it would be refreshing to return to civilization. Waterdeep: Dragon Heist is a treasure hunt with an urban backdrop. We've visited Waterdeep before, but not like this. Clever heroes will respect the city's rules. Those who get on the city's bad side are in for a rough time, as the City of Splendors is home to some of the most powerful figures in the Forgotten Realms.": "两年多前，当我告别巴罗维亚，把自己从漩涡深处拖出来，并计划对楚尔特进行为期一年的考察时，一个简单的问题开始在我脑海中回荡。我们下一步该去哪里？在琢磨了几个方案之后，我们决定回到文明社会中去，这将是一件令人振奋的事情。水底世界。龙劫》是一个以城市为背景的寻宝游戏。我们以前访问过沃特迪普，但不是这样的。聪明的英雄们会尊重城市的规则。那些对城市不利的人将会有一段艰难的时光，因为辉煌之城是被遗忘的王国中一些最强大的人物的家。",
	"Charlie Sanders, a lifelong D&D player, brought his experience writing for television to the project by helping flesh out the story bible months before work on the adventure was scheduled to begin. Matthew Mercer, whom you might know from the livestreamed show {@i Critical Role}, lent us his boundless imagination and helped flesh out the villains and their motives. A D&D adventure is only as good as its villains, and Waterdeep: Dragon Heist has multiple baddies to choose from.": "查理-桑德斯，一个终生的D&D玩家，把他为电视写作的经验带到了这个项目中，在冒险计划开始前的几个月帮助充实了故事圣经。马修-默瑟（Matthew Mercer），你可能在直播节目中认识他（%0%），他借给我们无限的想象力，帮助充实了反派人物和他们的动机。一场D&D冒险的好坏取决于它的反派人物，而《水底世界》。水底世界：龙之劫》有多个坏蛋可供选择。",
	"Before I pull back the curtain and lead you into the heart of Waterdeep, I wish to thank Ed Greenwood for making the City of Splendors what it is: the kind of magical place you wish in your heart was real.": "在我拉开帷幕，带领你进入沃特德普的中心地带之前，我想感谢艾德-格林伍德，是他让辉煌之城成为现在的样子：那种你心里希望是真实的神奇之地。",

	"Welcome to Waterdeep, the Crown of the North, where a wondrous tale of urban adventure is about to unfold. Our story begins with the gathering of adventurers at the Yawning Portal Inn and Tavern. {@creature volothamp \"volo\" geddarm|ToA|Volothamp Geddarm}, the famous explorer and raconteur, has a quest for them-one that entangles the characters in a bitter conflict between two nefarious organizations. If the adventurers complete his quest, Volo rewards them handsomely. Yet a much greater prize lies hidden somewhere in the City of Splendors, waiting to be claimed. Waterdeep: Dragon Heist is a Dungeons & Dragons adventure designed for characters starting at 1st level. By the end of the story, the characters will be at least 5th level. If you're planning to run through the adventure as a player, stop reading now!": "欢迎来到沃特迪普，北方的王冠，在这里一个奇妙的城市冒险故事即将展开。我们的故事从冒险家们在 \"打哈欠的门 \"旅馆和酒馆的聚会开始。著名的探险家和说书人{@creature volothamp \"volo\" geddarm|ToA|Volothamp Geddarm}为他们准备了一个任务--将这些人物卷入两个邪恶组织的激烈冲突中。如果冒险家们完成了他的任务，沃罗会给他们丰厚的奖励。然而，一个更大的奖励隐藏在辉煌之城的某个地方，等待着他们去领取。水底世界。龙与地下城》的冒险是为1级开始的角色设计的。在故事结束时，角色将至少达到5级。如果你打算以玩家的身份运行这个冒险，那么现在就不要再读了",
	"If you're looking for higher-level adventure content set in Waterdeep, a companion product titled {@i Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage} explores the vast dungeon under Waterdeep known as Undermountain and is designed for characters of levels all the way up to 20th.": "如果你正在寻找以水底世界为背景的更高层次的冒险内容，一个名为{@i Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage}的配套产品探索了水底世界下被称为Undermountain的巨大地下城，是为等级一直到20级的角色设计的。",
	"Waterdeep: Dragon Heist is a treasure hunt set against an urban backdrop. The adventure's plot can be summarized as follows:": "Waterdeep: 龙之劫》是一个以城市为背景的寻宝游戏。该冒险的情节可以概括为以下几点。",
	"Half a million gold coins are hidden somewhere in Waterdeep. Many individuals know about the cache and are looking for it. Adventurers can join the hunt and prevent the cache from falling into evil hands.": "50万枚金币藏在沃特迪普的某个地方。许多人知道这个藏匿处，并且正在寻找它。冒险家们可以加入追捕行动，防止藏匿处落入邪恶之手。",
	"The city is threatened by escalating tension between two power groups that is on the verge of flaring into violence. The Zhentarim, a shadowy network of mercenaries, and {@creature Xanathar|WDH}, the beholder crime lord of Waterdeep, are at odds, and when they clash, the characters are pulled into the conflict.": "这座城市受到了两个权力集团之间不断升级的紧张局势的威胁，这种紧张局势正处于爆发暴力的边缘。Zhentarim，一个阴暗的雇佣兵网络，和{@creature Xanathar|WDH}，Waterdeep的beholder crime lord，正处于矛盾之中，当他们发生冲突时，人物被拉入冲突之中。",
	"In Waterdeep, a gold coin is called a dragon. Before he was ousted from his position as the Open Lord of Waterdeep, Dagult Neverember embezzled half a million dragons and hid them in a secret vault. As a security precaution, he arranged for all knowledge of the vault's location and defenses to be magically erased from his mind and the minds of his subordinates. The wizard who performed the procedure trapped this knowledge within an artifact called the {@item Stone of Golorr|WDH}. The wizard disappeared shortly thereafter, and Dagult hid the stone in the Palace of Waterdeep.": "在沃特德普，一个金币被称为一条龙。在他被赶出水底世界开放领主的位置之前，达古特-纽伦堡挪用了50万条龙，并把它们藏在一个秘密的保险库里。作为一项安全预防措施，他安排将所有关于金库位置和防御的知识从他和他的下属的脑海中用魔法抹去。执行该程序的巫师将这些知识保存在一个名为\"%0%\"的工艺品中。此后不久，这位巫师就消失了，达古特将这块石头藏在水底宫殿中。",
	"Dagult was off rebuilding the city of Neverwinter when the other Lords of Waterdeep voted him out of office. He immediately made plans to retrieve the {@item Stone of Golorr|WDH} and smuggle his cache of dragons out of Waterdeep. His spies plucked the stone from the palace but were killed while trying to leave the city. The stone was stolen and passed from one hand to another like a common jewel until it wound up in the clutches of {@creature Xanathar|WDH}.": "当水底世界的其他领主投票把他赶下台时，达古特正去重建永夜城。他立即制定了计划，要取回{@item Stone of Golorr|WDH}，并将他的龙的藏匿处偷运出水底世界。他的间谍从宫殿里摘取了石头，但在试图离开城市时被杀。这块石头被盗，像普通的珠宝一样从一个人手中传到另一个人手中，直到它落入（1%）的魔掌。",
	"The {@item Stone of Golorr|WDH} is actually an aboleth transformed by magic. In this inanimate state, the aboleth can read the mind of any creature that attunes to the stone, as well as modify that creature's memory. A creature attuned to the stone can also extract information from the aboleth, including lore about Neverember's vault.": "这个{@item Stone of Golorr|WDH}实际上是一个被魔法改造过的Aboleth。在这种无生命的状态下，aboleth可以读取任何与石头相适应的生物的思想，并修改该生物的记忆。适应这块石头的生物也可以从阿波勒斯身上提取信息，包括关于纽恩堡金库的传说。",
	"Built long ago by dwarves, the vault is warded against all forms of magical detection and intrusion. Its current protector is an adult gold dragon named {@creature Aurinax|WDH}, who is also the current wielder and guardian of the {@item dragonstaff of Ahghairon|WDH}, which has the power to prevent other dragons from entering the city. In exchange for the staff, {@creature Aurinax|WDH} promised to guard the gold until such time as Neverember or his appointed vassals removed it.": "这个金库是由矮人在很久以前建造的，它的防护措施是防止所有形式的魔法探测和入侵。它目前的保护者是一只名为（%0%）的成年金龙，他也是（%1%）的现任持有者和守护者，它有能力阻止其他龙进入这个城市。作为对法杖的交换，{@creature Aurinax|WDH}承诺守护金子，直到纽伦堡或他指定的附庸将其移除。",
	"The map in the back of this book has the city of Waterdeep on both sides. One side can be shown to players. The other side is for the DM and includes tags marking important locations in the adventure.": "本书后面的地图两面都有水底城。一面可以给玩家看。另一面是给管理员看的，包括标记冒险中重要位置的标签。",
	"Beneath the city streets lurks a criminal underworld, its leader a beholder called {@creature Xanathar|WDH}. Hoping to gain a political foothold in Waterdeep, agents of the Zhentarim (also known as the Black Network) recently tried to ally their organization with the {@creature Xanathar|WDH} Guild. The architect of this attempt was a clone of the wizard {@creature Manshoon|WDH}, a founder of the Black Network long thought dead.": "在城市的街道下潜藏着一个犯罪的地下世界，它的领导者是一个叫{@creature Xanathar|WDH}的人。真塔林（Zhentarim）（也被称为黑网）的代理人希望在沃特迪普获得一个政治立足点，最近试图将他们的组织与（1%）公会结盟。这一企图的策划者是巫师{@creature Manshoon|WDH}的克隆人，他是黑网的创始人，长期以来被认为已经死亡。",
	"While the two sides were negotiating in {@creature Xanathar|WDH}'s lair, the {@item Stone of Golorr|WDH} suddenly disappeared from where {@creature Xanathar|WDH} had hidden it. The paranoid beholder accused the Black Network of stealing it and slew the Zhentarim envoys who were present. When the Zhents retaliated by attacking {@creature Xanathar|WDH} Guild outposts, {@creature Xanathar|WDH} took their actions as confirmation of the Black Network's vile intentions. Now the bad blood between the Zhentarim and {@creature Xanathar|WDH} has begun to spill into the streets, threatening peace throughout the city.": "当双方在{@creature Xanathar|WDH}的巢穴中进行谈判时，{@item Stone of Golorr|WDH}突然从{@creature Xanathar|WDH}隐藏的地方消失了。妄想症患者指责黑网偷走了它，并杀死了在场的镇特使。当镇特人通过攻击{@creature Xanathar|WDH}公会的前哨站进行报复时，{@creature Xanathar|WDH}认为他们的行动证实了黑网的卑鄙意图。现在，真塔里姆和{@creature Xanathar|WDH}之间的仇恨已经开始蔓延到街上，威胁着整个城市的和平。",
	"Who actually stole the {@item Stone of Golorr|WDH}? The answer: a rock gnome named Dalakhar. After Lord Neverember used magic to discern the gemstone's location, he sent forth a succession of spies to infiltrate {@creature Xanathar|WDH}'s lair and obtain it. Dalakhar succeeded where many others before him had failed, but his success turns out to be short-lived.": "究竟是谁偷了（%0%）？答案是：一个叫达拉哈的岩石侏儒。在Neverember勋爵用魔法辨别出宝石的位置后，他派出了一连串的间谍，潜入(%%)的巢穴并获得它。达拉哈成功了，在他之前的许多人都失败了，但他的成功是短暂的。",
	"The Yawning Portal serves as the default starting point for this story. One of the first people the adventurers meet there is Volothamp Geddarm. He has just returned from a tour promoting his latest book, {@book Volo's Guide to Monsters|vgm}, and he has a quest for the characters.": "打哈欠的门户是这个故事的默认起点。冒险家们在那里最先遇到的人之一是沃洛桑-格达姆。他刚从巡回宣传他的新书《%0%》回来，他有一个任务要交给这些人物。",
	"One of Volo's friends, a handsome simpleton named {@creature Floon Blagmaar|WDH}, has disappeared, seemingly kidnapped. The search for Floon leads to the revelation that he was caught up in a case of mistaken identity, and the characters are actually looking for two victims. The intended target was Lord Neverember's estranged son, {@creature Renaer Neverember|wdh}. Agents of the Zhentarim waylaid him because they want to know everything that Renaer knows about the cache of dragons. (Unfortunately for them, Renaer is ignorant of the cache and its whereabouts). If the characters rescue him, Renaer proves to be a worthy ally to adventurers hoping to make a name for themselves in Waterdeep.": "沃罗的一个朋友，一个名叫（%0%）的英俊憨厚的人，失踪了，似乎是被绑架了。寻找福隆的过程中发现，他被卷入了一个身份错误的案件中，而这些人物实际上是在寻找两名受害者。预定的目标是Neverember勋爵的疏远的儿子，{@creature Renaer Neverember|wdh}。Zhentarim的代理人拦截了他，因为他们想知道Renaer所知道的关于龙的缓存的一切。(对他们来说，不幸的是，雷纳对藏匿处和它的下落一无所知）。如果角色们把他救出来，那么对于希望在Waterdeep扬名立万的冒险者来说，Renaer证明是一个值得信赖的盟友。",
	"As a reward for rescuing Floon, Volo gives adventurers the deed to a building in the North Ward that looks out onto a wide cul-de-sac hemmed in by old residences and shops. The property used to be a tavern with a residence on the upper floors. The tavern has been closed for years, and the residence is haunted by a poltergeist that the characters can lay to rest.": "作为解救弗隆的奖励，沃罗将北区的一栋建筑的地契给了冒险者，这栋建筑可以看到一条宽阔的死胡同，被古老的住宅和商店包围着。这栋楼以前是一家酒馆，上面有一栋住宅。酒馆已经关闭多年，而住宅则被一个鬼魂困扰着，人物可以让它安息。",
	"Waterdeep is blanketed by an undispellable magical effect called {@i Ahghairon's dragonward}. The effect originates from somewhere under Ahghairon's Tower in the Castle Ward and is permanent. Dragons and all other creatures of the dragon type are physically unable to enter the city (or its sewers) as long as the dragonward persists. The effect doesn't extend to the harbor or into Undermountain.": "Waterdeep被一种不可驱使的魔法效果所笼罩，这种效果叫做（%0%）。该效果来自城堡区阿格海隆塔下的某处，并且是永久性的。只要向龙效应持续存在，龙和所有其他龙类生物就无法进入城市（或其下水道）。这个效果不会延伸到港口或进入地下山。",
	"A creature of the dragon type that is touched by the {@item dragonstaff of Ahghairon|WDH} (see {@adventure appendix A|WDH|11}) can ignore {@i Ahghairon's dragonward} and move through the city freely. The effect lasts until the creature is touched again by the staff, or until the passage of a period of time specified by one who is attuned to the staff.": "被{@item dragonstaff of Ahghairon|WDH}(见{@adventure appendix A|WDH|11})触及的龙类生物可以无视{@i Ahghairon's dragonward}并在城市中自由移动。该效果持续到该生物再次被法杖触及，或者直到与法杖相适应的人指定的时间段过去。",
	"The {@i dragonstaff} is currently in the possession of an adult gold dragon named {@creature Aurinax|WDH} (see {@adventure appendix B|WDH|12}), who guards a hidden vault under the city.": "目前，{@i dragonstaff}被一条名为{@creature Aurinax|WDH}的成年金龙所拥有(见{@adventure appendix B|WDH|12})，他守卫着城市下的一个隐藏的金库。",
	"As time goes on, the characters attract the attention of local factions hoping to recruit them while they settle into the city. Eventually, these relatively peaceful times are shattered when a fireball detonates near their new residence. The characters are swept up in the aftermath of this horrific event and can try to get to the bottom of it. Who cast the {@spell fireball} spell and why? Who was the intended target? They can investigate the incident on behalf of a guild or a faction, or they can become involved for reasons of their own.": "随着时间的推移，这些人物吸引了当地派别的注意，希望在他们融入城市的同时招募他们。最终，当一个火球在他们的新住所附近引爆时，这些相对平静的时光被打破了。角色们被卷进了这一恐怖事件的后果中，并可以尝试去了解它的真相。谁施展了{@spell fireball}的咒语，为什么？谁是预定的目标？他们可以代表一个公会或一个派别调查这个事件，也可以因为自己的原因而卷入其中。",
	"One casualty of the fireball is in fact its intended target: Lord Neverember's spy, Dalakhar. Whoever killed the gnome now has the {@item Stone of Golorr|WDH}, the key to finding the lost cache of dragons. One way or another, depending on the alliances-and the enemies-they have made in the city, the characters become embroiled in the chase for the stone and the hoard it protects.": "火球的一个牺牲者实际上是它的预定目标。永恒之城的间谍，达拉哈尔。杀死地精的人现在有了{@item Stone of Golorr|WDH}，这是找到丢失的龙藏的关键。或多或少，取决于他们在城市中结成的联盟和敌人，这些人物都卷入了对石头和它所保护的囤积物的追逐中。",
	"When you run this adventure, you choose its main villain at the outset. Your choice determines the season of the year in which the story takes place, as well as the antagonists in several of the encounters in chapter 4. The villain you choose opposes the player characters, while the villains you don't choose become part of the backdrop and could help the characters or hinder them.": "当你运行这个冒险时，你在一开始就选择它的主要反派。你的选择决定了故事发生在哪一年的哪个季节，以及第四章中几个遭遇战中的对手。你选择的反派会反对玩家角色，而你不选择的反派则会成为背景的一部分，可能会帮助角色或阻碍他们。",
	"As another unusual feature of this adventure, the villains aren't meant to be killed, nor are they out to kill the player characters. The villains are after a treasure hoard, and the adventurers' ultimate goal is to keep the treasure out of their clutches.": "作为这次冒险的另一个不同寻常的特点，恶棍们并不是要被杀死的，他们也不是要杀死玩家角色。恶棍们的目标是宝藏，而冒险家们的最终目标是不让宝藏落入他们的魔掌。",
	"You can swap out one villain for another at any time.

	"{@creature Xanathar|WDH} has a healthy fear of {@creature Laeral Silverhand|WDH} and is inclined to spare those in her employ, to avoid provoking a conflict with Waterdeep's Open Lord.

Activity in the city slows to a crawl, since Waterdavians are unaccustomed to such heat.": "沃特德普的夏天相当舒适，是市民和游客在户外聚集的好时机。市场比一年中的任何时候都要繁忙。但有时，暖空气从南方推上来，在城市北部和东部的山谷里定居。这些空气被困住，形成可能持续几天或几周的热浪。城市里的活动会慢下来，因为沃特达威人不习惯这种热。",

An explosion tears through Trollskull Alley, prompting an investigation that hurls the characters into conflict with some secondary villains, culminating in a bloody confrontation at a noble estate.": "第三章开始于几天或几周之后，让人物有时间适应城市生活并追求自己的兴趣。一场爆炸撕裂了巨魔胡同，引发了一场调查，使人物与一些次要的恶棍发生冲突，最终在一个贵族庄园发生了一场血腥的对峙。",
	"In chapter 4, the characters race to find the gold. The encounters in this chapter and the order in which they occur change depending on the villain you've chosen. The chapter concludes with the discovery of Lord Neverember's treasure vault and a showdown with its gold dragon guardian.

You can gently steer characters in a different direction, drop hints that urge them to use extreme caution, or make deadly encounters easier. It also bears remembering that the villains are meant to be thwarted, not killed, and they are rarely spoiling for a fight. Adventurers who get in over their heads can be knocked {@condition unconscious} rather than killed. Such characters might awaken in an alley, a sewer tunnel, or a prison cell, with or without their gear. Conversely, they might awaken safe and sound with all their gear in a private residence, being cared for by friendly NPCs who took them in.": "如果角色在完成第四章之前发现自己在反派的巢穴中，请准备好即时调整，因为每个巢穴中的挑战对于低于五级的角色来说都很难克服。你可以温和地引导角色往不同的方向走，给他们一些提示，敦促他们使用极度谨慎的方法，或者让致命的遭遇变得更容易。还应该记住，反派人物是要被挫败的，而不是要被杀死的，他们很少会破坏一场战斗。陷入困境的冒险者可以被击倒（%0%），而不是被杀死。这样的角色可能会在小巷、下水道或牢房中醒来，无论是否有装备。相反，他们可能会在私人住宅中带着所有装备安然醒来，并得到收留他们的友好NPC的照顾。",

	"Characters who overtly engage in criminal behavior are quickly cornered and arrested by members of the City Watch. Those charged with committing a crime are brought before a magister to be judged.

	"When the authorities show up to arrest one or more player characters for breaking the law, you can handle the arrest in one of two ways.": "当当局出现逮捕一个或多个玩家角色的违法行为时，你可以用两种方式之一来处理逮捕行为。",
	"The first approach is to roleplay the encounter with the arresting officers of the City Watch. The benefit of this approach is that characters can choose to go quietly or resist. The drawback is that the encounter might devolve into a fight-or-flight situation, leading to one or more characters becoming fugitives. If the party includes one or more characters who aren't lawful, such an outcome is likely. To mitigate this drawback, you might allow fugitive characters to forge alliances with NPCs who can help clear their names.": "第一种方法是对与城市守望的逮捕人员的遭遇进行角色扮演。这种方法的好处是，角色可以选择安静地离开或反抗。缺点是，这种遭遇可能会演变成不战而屈人之兵的局面，导致一个或多个角色成为逃亡者。如果聚会中包括一个或多个不守法的角色，这样的结果就很可能发生。为了减轻这个缺点，你可以让逃亡的角色与能够帮助他们洗脱罪名的NPC结成联盟。",
	"If the threat of arrest becomes tedious, you can switch to the second approach, which is to merely inform the players that one or more characters have been arrested. You can describe the arrest, the subsequent detention, and the events leading up to the trial. The drawback to this approach is that player characters have no control over the situation. (This sense of helplessness has the virtue of being realistic, if not fun.) To mitigate this drawback, you might allow characters to make ability checks to influence the outcome; for example, a successful Charisma (Persuasion) check might enable a character to bribe an official or sow enough doubt in the mind of a magistrate to have the case thrown out.": "如果逮捕的威胁变得乏味，你可以改用第二种方法，也就是仅仅告知玩家一个或多个角色被逮捕了。你可以描述逮捕，随后的拘留，以及导致审判的事件。这种方法的缺点是，玩家角色无法控制局势。(这种无助感即使不有趣，也有现实的优点。)为了减轻这个缺点，你可以让角色进行能力检查以影响结果；例如，成功的魅力（劝说）检查可以使角色贿赂官员或在地方法官心中播下足够的怀疑，从而使案件被驳回。",
	"Important NPCs in the adventure are given names, but many of the secondary NPCs aren't named. {@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|xge} contains an appendix of {@5etools tables you can use to randomly generate names|names.html} for human and non-human NPCs if you have trouble coming up with names on your own.": "冒险中的重要NPC都有名字，但许多次要NPC没有名字。{@book Xanathar's Guide to Everything|xge}包含一个人类和非人类NPC的附录{@5etools tables you can use to randomly generate names|names.html}，如果你在自己想出名字的时候遇到困难。",

Kenku that are still alive and present are taken into custody, and it doesn't take long for the City Watch to conclude that the dead men are members of the Zhentarim and the {@creature Xanathar|WDH} Guild, since violent encounters between the two factions are becoming ever more frequent. While his constables search the warehouse, Captain Staget questions the characters.": "在人物找到雷纳后不久，一位名叫Hyustus Staget的城市守卫队队长（LG男性伊鲁斯坎人（%0%））带领一打人（%1%）来到仓库。在接到可疑活动的报告后，他们闯了进去，试图阻止任何人离开。仍然活着并在场的肯库被拘押起来，没过多久，城市守望者就得出结论，死者是赞塔林和（%%2%）公会的成员，因为这两个派别之间的暴力冲突越来越频繁。在他的警员们搜查仓库的时候，斯塔吉特队长询问了这些人物。",

After all, he reasons, if the {@creature Xanathar|WDH} Guild and the Zhentarim want to destroy each other, why not let them?": "斯塔吉特队长是一个紧张的人，帮助维持码头区的和平。码头区的每个店主、公会成员、旅店老板和酒馆老板都认识他，而且大多数人都尊重他，不管他们对城市守望者的看法如何。斯塔吉特不相信谣言或流言蜚语，他不喝酒，也不会让愤怒影响到他的心情。他的工作是遏制码头区的暴力，但他一直在拖后腿。毕竟，他的理由是，如果{@creature Xanathar|WDH}公会和Zhentarim想摧毁对方，为什么不让他们这样做呢？",
	"Staget once had the warehouse under surveillance, but elected to pull the detail to bolster patrols throughout the Dock Ward-a decision he now regrets. That surveillance was part of an attempt to catch a known Zhent instigator named {@creature Urstul Floxin|wdh}, a \"big fish\" rumored to be responsible for much of the recent strife. Staget doesn't share this information with strangers.": "斯塔吉特曾经监视过这个仓库，但他选择抽调人员加强对整个码头区的巡逻--他现在对这个决定感到后悔。那次监视是为了抓住一个已知的Zhent煽动者的一部分，他的名字叫{@creature Urstul Floxin|wdh}，据传是一条 \"大鱼\"，对最近的纷争负有很大责任。斯塔吉特不与陌生人分享这些信息。",
	"Staget and Renaer recognize each other, though they aren't well acquainted. The involvement of a Neverember noble prompts the captain to be on his best behavior. He is prepared to overlook any crimes committed by the characters as long as Renaer is with them, but he gives them a folded sheet of parchment with the Code Legal written on it and encourages them to read it.

	"If the characters ask for the Watch's help in locating Floon, Staget makes it clear that he won't send a force into the sewers in search of someone who might well be a Zhent or {@creature Xanathar|WDH} Guild spy. If they appear intent on involving themselves further in the conflict between the Zhentarim and the {@creature Xanathar|WDH} Guild, Staget imparts some free advice before letting them go:": "如果这些人物请求守望者帮助找到弗隆，斯塔吉特明确表示，他不会派人进入下水道寻找一个很可能是赞特或（%0%）公会间谍的人。如果他们似乎有意进一步卷入赞塔林和{@creature Xanathar|WDH}公会之间的冲突，斯塔吉特在放他们走之前给了一些免费的建议。",

	"At this point, the characters likely know that Floon was kidnapped by {@creature Xanathar|WDH} Guild members who mistook him for {@creature Renaer Neverember|wdh}, and that he was taken to a hideout in the sewers.

A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check or 5 gp in bribes allows the characters to trace the kidnappers' path through back alleys to a circular metal cover inset in the pavement. The cover is easily lifted, revealing a ladder down into the sewers.": "在这一点上，人物可能知道Floon是被{@creature Xanathar|WDH}公会成员绑架的，他们误以为他是{@creature Renaer Neverember|wdh}，他被带到了下水道的一个藏身处。如果人物没有从Kenku那里得知Floon被带到哪里，询问当地人可以发现很多人看到他被拖走。成功通过DC15智力（调查）检查或5戈比的贿赂，可以让角色追踪绑匪的路径，穿过后巷，找到一个嵌入路面的圆形金属盖。这个盖子很容易就被掀开了，露出了一个通往下水道的梯子。",

	"Dalakhar, a rock gnome spy working for Lord Dagult Neverember, was on his way to see the characters when the fireball went off, killing him and ten other people. The gnome is important because he was carrying the {@item Stone of Golorr|WDH} (see {@adventure appendix A|WDH|11})-the key to finding Lord Neverember's hidden cache of gold. Hounded by agents of the Zhentarim, the {@creature Xanathar|WDH} Guild, and Bregan D'aerthe, Dalakhar was unable to escape from Waterdeep with the artifact, so he planned to entrust it to the characters briefly, for surely the folk who rescued Lord Neverember's son could keep it safe where he could not.": "达拉哈，一个为达古特-纽文尔勋爵工作的岩石地精间谍，当火球爆炸时，他正在去见这些人物的路上，他和其他十个人都死了。这个地精很重要，因为他带着{@item Stone of Golorr|WDH}（见{@adventure appendix A|WDH|11}）--找到Neverember勋爵隐藏的黄金库的关键。被Zhentarim、{@creature Xanathar|WDH}公会和Bregan D'aerthe的特工追捕，Dalakhar无法带着神器逃出Waterdeep，所以他打算把它短暂地托付给这些人物，因为救出Neverember勋爵儿子的人肯定能在他无法做到的地方保护它。",

	"Three members of the Black Network, including the Zhent assassin {@creature Urstul Floxin|wdh} (see {@adventure appendix B|WDH|12}), were close to nabbing Dalakhar when they were caught in the blast. Of the three, only Urstul survived. Though he was wounded, he was able to pluck the {@item Stone of Golorr|WDH} from Dalakhar's pocket before fleeing the scene. While other survivors were coming to their senses, Urstul stumbled through the smoke and haze and eventually made his way back to Gralhund Villa a short distance away.": "三名黑网成员，包括赞特刺客{@creature Urstul Floxin|wdh}（见{@adventure appendix B|WDH|12}），在接近抓捕达拉哈时被卷入爆炸。这三个人中，只有乌尔斯图尔幸存下来。虽然他受了伤，但在逃离现场之前，他还是从达拉哈的口袋里掏出了{@item Stone of Golorr|WDH}。当其他幸存者逐渐清醒过来的时候，乌尔斯图尔跌跌撞撞地穿过烟雾和阴霾，最终回到了不远处的格拉洪德别墅。",
	"The heads of the Gralhund noble family, {@creature Yalah Gralhund|wdh} and her husband, {@creature Orond Gralhund|wdh|Orond}, are providing coin and shelter to Urstul and his fellow Zhents in exchange for the promise of getting their fair share of the hidden cache of gold. But the Gralhunds aren't willing to put their trust entirely in the Black Network; they sent out their own agent to shadow the Zhents, eliminate Dalakhar, and obtain the {@item Stone of Golorr|WDH} on their behalf. Yalah gave the would-be assassin a {@item necklace of fireballs} with instructions on how and when to use it. When it seemed as though Dalakhar might give {@creature Urstul Floxin|wdh} the slip, this agent hurled one of the beads from the necklace to stop the gnome in his tracks.": "Gralhund贵族家族的首领{@creature Yalah Gralhund|wdh}和她的丈夫{@creature Orond Gralhund|wdh|Orond}向Urstul和他的Zhents同伴提供钱币和住所，以换取他们在隐藏的黄金库中获得公平份额的承诺。但格拉洪德人并不愿意完全信任黑网；他们派出了自己的特工来跟踪甄子丹，消灭达拉哈，并代表他们获得（2%）。亚拉给了这个可能的刺客一个{@item necklace of fireballs}，并说明了如何和何时使用它。当达拉哈似乎可能给{@creature Urstul Floxin|wdh}滑倒时，这个特工从项链上扔下一颗珠子，阻止了地精的行动。",
	"The Gralhunds' assassin is a {@creature nimblewright|wdh} (see {@adventure appendix B|WDH|12}) that escaped from the House of Inspired Hands, the temple of Gond in the Sea Ward, a month ago.

	"A magistrate provides the City Watch with a warrant to search Gralhund Villa. Sometime afterward, Cromley visits the characters by himself and, as a courtesy, tells them what happened:": "一位地方法官向城市守望者提供了搜查格拉洪德别墅的许可。之后的某个时候，克罗姆利独自拜访了这些人物，出于礼貌，告诉他们发生了什么。",
	"Officers arrived to find Lord Gralhund {@condition unconscious}, Lady Gralhund in shock, and their half-orc bodyguard bloodied but unbowed.": "警官们赶到时发现格拉洪德勋爵（%0%）、格拉洪德夫人处于震惊之中，他们的半兽人保镖浑身是血但没有受伤。",
	"Apparently, the Gralhunds had been held hostage for more than a tenday by agents of the Black Network. Most of the Zhents were killed during a bloody revolt led by Lord Gralhund himself.": "显然，Gralhunds已经被黑网的特工挟持了一个多星期了。大多数Zhents人在Gralhund勋爵本人领导的血腥叛乱中被杀。",
	"The Zhent leader, {@creature Urstul Floxin|wdh}, was among those who got away. He's still at large. The Watch plans to step up its search for him.": "Zhent的领导，{@creature Urstul Floxin|wdh}，是那些逃脱的人中的一员。他仍然在逃。观察团计划加强对他的搜寻。",
	"Of the nimblewright, there was no sign. According to the Gralhunds, the construct was delivered to Gralhund Villa weeks earlier. The family took it in, not realizing it was a Zhentarim spy. Lady Gralhund reported that it stole her {@item necklace of fireballs}.": "敏捷的人，没有任何迹象。根据格拉洪德家族的说法，这个构造物在几周前被送到了格拉洪德别墅。这家人收留了它，没有意识到它是一个Zhentarim的间谍。格拉洪德夫人报告说，它偷走了她的（%0%）。",
	"Cromley's summary of events is based on information given to the City Watch by the Gralhunds and is riddled with falsehoods. The hostage situation, Lord Gralhund's heroism, and the theft of Lady Gralhund's {@item necklace of fireballs} never happened. The nimblewright's affiliation with the Zhentarim is also a lie. The Gralhunds' account further doesn't explain why the {@creature nimblewright|wdh} would use the {@item necklace of fireballs} to inflict harm on the Zhents if it was working with them. If characters raise that question, Cromley thinks for a moment and then ventures the guess that the nimblewright underestimated the necklace's explosive power.": "克罗姆利对事件的总结是基于格拉洪德家族给城市守望者的信息，其中充满了虚假的内容。人质事件、格拉洪德勋爵的英雄主义以及格拉洪德夫人的盗窃事件（%0%）从未发生过。nimblewright与Zhentarim的关系也是一个谎言。Gralhunds的说法更没有解释为什么{@creature nimblewright|wdh}会利用{@item necklace of fireballs}对Zhents造成伤害，如果它是与他们合作的话。如果人物提出这个问题，克罗姆利思考了一会儿，然后大胆猜测，敏捷的人低估了项链的爆炸力。",
	"The characters can insert themselves into Gralhund Villa and accost its residents with impunity if they're careful to pin the violence on the Zhents or if they're able to enter and leave unseen before the City Watch shows up to arrest everyone.": "如果他们小心翼翼地将暴力事件归咎于Zhents，或者他们能够在城市守望者出现逮捕所有人之前神不知鬼不觉地进入和离开，那么这些人物就可以插入Gralhund Villa，并肆无忌惮地搭讪其居民。",
	"Sneaking in or out of the villa without being seen or heard by neighbors and passersby requires each character to succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity (Stealth) check. A character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill can take disadvantage on the check to grant advantage on another party member's check (essentially compensating for a less stealthy companion).": "在不被邻居和路人看到或听到的情况下溜进或溜出别墅，需要每个角色在DC15灵巧（隐身）检查中取得成功。熟练掌握隐身技能的人物可以在检查中处于劣势，从而在另一个成员的检查中获得优势（基本上是对隐身能力较差的同伴的补偿）。",
	"If the characters side with the Gralhunds in the conflict, Lady Gralhund is inclined to overlook their trespass. Her demeanor sours, however, if they start asking too many questions. She vigorously denies accusations that her family is involved with the Black Network and claims the Zhents were holding her family hostage (a false claim also parroted by her husband, her bodyguard, her children, and her staff). If the characters assault any member of the household or brandish weapons in an attempt to intimidate, the Gralhunds inform the City Watch of the party's crimes.": "如果角色们在冲突中站在格拉洪德一边，格拉洪德夫人就会倾向于忽略他们的侵犯行为。然而，如果他们开始问太多的问题，她的态度就会变坏。她极力否认关于她的家族与黑网有关的指控，并声称Zhents人挟持了她的家人（她的丈夫、她的保镖、她的孩子和她的工作人员也是这样的错误说法）。如果人物攻击任何家庭成员或挥舞武器试图恐吓，格拉洪德人就会将该党的罪行告知城市守望。",
	"During the characters' invasion of Gralhund Villa, the {@creature nimblewright|wdh} flees the estate with the {@item Stone of Golorr|WDH} (see chapter 4 for more information on its destination). If the characters are using Nim's nimblewright detector to track the nimblewright, the device lets them know that the nimblewright has fled the scene, but not the direction it went.": "在人物入侵Gralhund Villa的过程中，{@creature nimblewright|wdh}和{@item Stone of Golorr|WDH}一起逃离了庄园（关于其目的地的更多信息，见第4章）。如果角色们使用尼姆的小精灵探测器来追踪小精灵，这个装置会让他们知道小精灵已经逃离了现场，但不知道它去的方向。",
	"Gralhund Villa sits in the middle of an upper-class residential neighborhood in the North Ward. Here are some general facts to keep in mind:": "格拉洪德别墅坐落在北区的一个上层住宅区的中间。以下是一些需要记住的一般事实。",
	"The streets around the villa have pedestrians and coaches traveling along them at all hours, though traffic is heavier during the day.": "别墅周围的街道上随时都有行人和教练车在行驶，不过白天的交通比较繁忙。",

	"Neighbors and bystanders alert the City Watch if they hear loud, disturbing noises (such as a {@spell thunderwave} spell) coming from the estate or if they see anything suspicious. The Watch sends a {@creature mage} and six {@creature veteran||veterans} (one {@creature sergeant|WDH} and five constables) to investigate, and it takes {@dice 1d6 + 4} minutes for this force to arrive.": "邻居和旁观者如果听到来自庄园的响亮、令人不安的声音（如{@spell thunderwave}的咒语），或看到任何可疑的东西，就会向城市观察站报警。观察站派出一名（%%1%）和六名（%%2%）（一名（%%3%）和五名警员）去调查，这支队伍需要（%%4%）分钟才能到达。",

	"An {@spell arcane lock} spell is cast on the gates. Forcing them open requires a successful DC 25 Strength (Athletics) check, while picking the lock requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools. The spell doesn't bar members of the Gralhund family, their staff, their guards, or Lady Gralhund's {@creature nimblewright|wdh} from opening the gates.": "一个{@spell arcane lock}的咒语被施加在大门上。强行打开需要成功进行DC25力量（运动）检查，而开锁则需要成功进行DC20灵巧检查，使用盗贼的工具。这个咒语并不禁止格拉洪德家族的成员、他们的工作人员、他们的卫兵或格拉洪德夫人（%1%）打开大门。",
	"The estate is well tended. In spring and summer, large trees provide shade. The trees begin shedding leaves in the fall. By winter, their branches are stripped bare.": "这座庄园被精心打理。在春天和夏天，大树提供了阴凉。这些树在秋天开始落叶。到了冬天，它们的树枝被剥光了。",
	"Through the trees, the characters can see a large balcony ({@area G17|116}) enclosed by an iron railing above the mansion's main entrance.

	"The yard is looked after by a menacing groundskeeper named Hurv Taldred (LE male Illuskan {@creature cult fanatic}) and his two quiet {@creature mastiff||mastiffs}. The Gralhunds paid a necromancer to perform a ritual on Hurv and his mastiffs.

Although she wasn't involved in the matters concerning Gralhund Villa, she is worried that the Watch will uncover her illegal currency-lending operation in the course of its investigations. She offers the characters 10 pp just for meeting with her and promises another 40 pp if the characters agree to help her lie low for a tenday-half to be paid once a deal is struck and half at the end of her stay. If they decline her offer and the party includes one or more Zhentarim members, she threatens that if she's arrested and charged with a crime, she will reveal their affiliation and bring them down with her.": "伊斯特丽德担心被城市监察局逮捕。虽然她并没有参与有关格拉洪德别墅的事情，但她担心守望先锋会在调查过程中发现她的非法货币借贷业务。她给人物提供了10个pp，只是为了和她见面，并承诺如果人物同意帮助她潜伏一天，则再提供40个pp--交易达成后支付一半，在她逗留结束后支付一半。如果他们拒绝了她的提议，并且队伍中包括一个或多个Zhentarim成员，她威胁说如果她被逮捕并被指控犯罪，她将揭露他们的隶属关系并把他们也拉下水。",
	"If the characters decide to let Istrid hide out at their tavern, she uses a disguise kit to make herself up to be a male dwarf named Jorn.

Ultimately, no one comes looking for her, but the longer she stays hidden, the more testy and demanding she becomes.": "如果角色们决定让伊斯特丽德躲在他们的酒馆里，她会用一个伪装工具把自己装扮成一个名叫乔恩的男性矮人。如果被要求这样做，一旦她安顿下来，她愿意在这里做一些杂务。最终，没有人来找她，但她藏得越久，她就变得越暴躁，要求越高。",
	"If the characters tolerate her bad behavior, Istrid leaves at the end of the tenday as promised and pays characters the remainder of what she owes.
