	"This Dungeons & Dragons adventure begins in a world of your choosing—perhaps a world of your own creation—then ventures into the Feywild. Also known as the Plane of Faerie, the Feywild is a place of wonder and whimsy ruled by unfettered emotion. Before running this adventure, please read the \"{@book Feywild|DMG|2|Feywild}\" section in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, as it contains useful information about this dusky, fantastic plane of existence.": "这个龙与地下城的冒险从你选择的世界开始--也许是你自己创造的世界--然后冒险进入精灵世界。也被称为精灵界，精灵界是一个由无拘无束的情感所统治的奇迹和奇思妙想的地方。在进行这个冒险之前，请阅读{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中的\"{@book Feywild|DMG|2|Feywild} \"部分，因为它包含了关于这个昏暗的、奇妙的存在空间的有用信息。",
	"The information in this book is intended for the DM's eyes only. If you're planning to play through the adventure with someone else as your DM, stop reading now!": "本书中的信息仅用于DM的眼睛。如果你打算和别人一起玩这个冒险，那么现在就不要再看了。",
	"The main antagonists of this story are three hags who collectively form the Hourglass Coven, which is described in {@area appendix B|44e|x}. These hags are the adoptive sisters of Iggwilv, a powerful figure from D&D's past and a key player in the adventure's unfolding drama. Using an artifact called {@item Iggwilv's Cauldron|WBtW}, the hags have trapped an archfey named Zybilna in temporal stasis and carved up her fey domain among them. This domain is called Prismeer. To enter it, the characters must first visit the Witchlight Carnival, which travels across the Material Plane and appears on the characters' world once every eight years. The carnival owners are a pair of shadar-kai (elves native to the Shadowfell) named {@creature Mister Witch|WBtW} and {@creature Mister Light|WBtW}, who can help or hinder the characters' efforts to reach Prismeer.": "这个故事的主要对立面是三个女巫，她们共同组成了沙漏女巫团，在{@area appendix B|44e|x}中有所描述。这些女巫是Iggwilv的养姐妹，Iggwilv是D&D过去的一个强大人物，也是冒险故事中的一个关键人物。这些女巫使用一种叫做{@item Iggwilv's Cauldron|WBtW}的神器，将一个名叫Zybilna的大帝困在了时间静止中，并在她们中间划分出了她的精灵领域。这个领域被称为Prismeer。要进入这个领域，人物必须首先访问巫师之光狂欢节，它穿越物质世界，每八年在人物的世界出现一次。狂欢节的主人是一对名叫{@creature Mister Witch|WBtW}和{@creature Mister Light|WBtW}的Shadar-kai（原产于Shadowfell的精灵），他们可以帮助或阻碍角色到达Prismeer的努力。",
	"One of the many novelties of this adventure is that the characters can accomplish their goals without resorting to violence—but only if they're clever. They can fight their way through the adventure as well, but the odds won't always be in their favor.": "这场冒险的许多新奇之处在于，人物可以在不诉诸暴力的情况下实现他们的目标--但前提是他们要聪明。他们也可以通过冒险的方式战斗，但胜算并不总是对他们有利。",
	"The characters are drawn into the adventure by one of two adventure hooks. You choose which hook to use. Both hooks are described in \"{@area Beginning the Adventure|045|x},\" later in this introduction.": "角色被两个冒险钩中的一个吸引到冒险中。你可以选择使用哪个钩子。这两个钩子都在本介绍后面的\"{@area Beginning the Adventure|045|x} \"中描述。",
	"{@adventure Chapter 1|WBtW|1} describes the Witchlight Carnival. Hidden somewhere in the carnival is a fey crossing to the domain of Prismeer, but the trick to opening this portal is known only to the carnival's shadar-kai owners, {@creature Mister Witch|WBtW} and {@creature Mister Light|WBtW}.": "{@adventure Chapter 1|WBtW|1}描述了巫师之光狂欢节。在狂欢节的某个地方隐藏着一个通往普利斯梅尔领域的精灵通道，但打开这个通道的诀窍只有狂欢节的主人沙达凯（%%1%）和（%%2%）知道。",
	"{@adventure Chapters 2|WBtW|2}, {@adventure 3|WBtW|3}, and {@adventure 4|WBtW|4} describe the carved-up domain of Prismeer, which the hags of the Hourglass Coven have usurped and split into thirds. The characters can move between these splinter-realms only if they have the right fey guides to help them.": "{@adventure Chapters 2|WBtW|2}、{@adventure 3|WBtW|3}和{@adventure 4|WBtW|4}描述的是普利斯梅尔的刻板领域，沙漏巫师团的巫师们篡夺了这个领域，并将其分成了三部分。只有在有合适的精灵向导帮助他们的情况下，人物才能在这些分裂的领域之间移动。",
	"{@adventure Chapter 5|WBtW|5} describes the Palace of Heart's Desire, where the archfey Zybilna and her court are frozen in time by the magic of {@item Iggwilv's Cauldron|WBtW}. The palace is where the characters need to go if they hope to thwart the Hourglass Coven by freeing Zybilna or destroying the cauldron.": "{@adventure Chapter 5|WBtW|5}描述了心愿之宫，大王Zybilna和她的宫廷被{@item Iggwilv's Cauldron|WBtW}的魔法冻结在那里。如果他们希望通过解救Zybilna或摧毁大锅来挫败沙漏女巫团，那么这座宫殿就是他们需要去的地方。",
	"The book concludes with several appendices wherein you'll find rules for new magic items, stat blocks for new creatures, and other goodies. At the end of the book is a {@adventure Story Tracker|WBtW|11} you can use to keep track of story developments as they occur. Advice on how to use the Story Tracker appears later in this introduction.": "本书最后有几个附录，其中你会发现新的魔法物品的规则，新生物的状态块，以及其他一些好东西。在书的末尾有一个{@adventure Story Tracker|WBtW|11}，你可以用它来跟踪故事的发展，因为它们发生了。关于如何使用故事追踪器的建议将在本介绍的后面出现。",
	"The adventure assumes that the characters start at 1st level. If your players are more interested in exploration and social interaction than combat, or if you want to make the characters' Feywild excursion less dangerous, have them start at 3rd level instead. Advancement is handled the same way regardless.": "这个冒险假定角色从1级开始。如果你的玩家对探索和社会交往比战斗更感兴趣，或者如果你想让角色的Feywild之旅不那么危险，可以让他们从3级开始。无论如何，进阶的方式都是一样的。",
	"In this adventure, the characters receive experience points for achieving milestones rather than defeating monsters:": "在这次冒险中，人物因实现里程碑而获得经验值，而不是打败怪物。",
	"Whenever the characters enter a hag's realm (Hither, Thither, or Yon) for the first time, everyone in the party receives enough XP to advance 1 level. For example, when the characters leave the Witchlight Carnival and arrive in Hither for the first time, they gain a level.": "每当人物第一次进入巫师的领域（Hither, Thither, or Yon），队伍中的每个人都会得到足够的XP来提升1级。例如，当人物离开巫师之光狂欢节并首次到达Hither时，他们会获得一个等级。",
	"After the characters encounter a hag of the Hourglass Coven for the first time, everyone in the party who survives the encounter receives enough XP to advance 1 level.": "在人物第一次遇到沙漏女巫后，党内每个人只要在这次遭遇中幸存下来，就能得到足够的XP值来提升1级。",
	"If the characters free Zybilna from temporal stasis or destroy {@item Iggwilv's Cauldron|WBtW}, everyone in the party receives enough XP to advance 1 level.": "如果人物将Zybilna从时空停滞中解救出来或摧毁{@item Iggwilv's Cauldron|WBtW}，党内的每个人都会得到足够的XP来提升1级。",
	"If you follow this method of character advancement, characters who start the adventure at 1st level might reach 8th level by the adventure's conclusion.": "如果你按照这种方法进行角色升级，从1级开始冒险的角色在冒险结束时可能达到8级。",
	"To run the adventure, you need the fifth edition core rulebooks ({@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, and {@book Monster Manual|MM}).": "要运行这个冒险，你需要第五版核心规则书（（%0%）、（%1%）和（%2%））。",
	"Text that appears in a box like this is meant to be read aloud or paraphrased for the players when their characters first arrive at a location or under a specific circumstance, as described in the text.": "出现在这样的方框中的文字是为了让玩家在他们的角色第一次到达某个地点或在某个特定情况下大声朗读或转述，如文中所述。",
	"The {@book Monster Manual|MM} contains stat blocks for most of the creatures encountered in this adventure. When a creature's name appears in {@b bold} type, that's a visual cue pointing you to its stat block as a way of saying, \"Hey, DM, you'd better get this creature's stat block ready. You're going to need it.\" If the stat block is not from the {@book Monster Manual|MM}, the adventure's text tells you where to find it.": "{@book Monster Manual|MM}包含了这次冒险中遇到的大多数生物的状态块。当一个生物的名字以{@b bold}类型出现时，那是一个视觉提示，指向你的状态块，是在说：\"嘿，管理员，你最好把这个生物的状态块准备好。你将会需要它。\" 如果状态块不是来自（%2%），冒险的文字会告诉你在哪里找到它。",
	"Spells and equipment mentioned in the adventure are described in the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}. Magic items are described in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} unless the adventure's text directs you to {@adventure appendix A|WBtW|6}.": "冒险中提到的法术和装备在（%0%）中描述。魔法物品在{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中描述，除非冒险中的文字指示你去{@adventure appendix A|WBtW|6}。",
	"This book contains a fold-out, double-sided poster map and several interior maps. These elements are further described in the sections that follow.": "本书包含一张折叠式双面海报地图和几张内部地图。这些内容将在后面的章节中进一步描述。",
	"The adventure lets you know when it's safe to show your players either side of the double-sided poster map.": "冒险让你知道什么时候可以向你的玩家展示双面海报地图的任何一面，这是很安全的。",
	"One side of the poster map shows the Witchlight Carnival and a Time Tracker, to help you track the passage of time as the characters explore the carnival. Certain carnival events occur only when the Time Tracker reaches a certain point. Though it's not necessary, your group can place tokens or miniatures on the map to keep track of where the characters are in the carnival at any given time.": "海报地图的一面显示了巫师之光狂欢节和一个时间追踪器，以帮助你在人物探索狂欢节的过程中追踪时间的推移。只有当时间追踪器达到某个点时，某些狂欢节事件才会发生。虽然没有必要，但你的小组可以在地图上放置令牌或小模型，以追踪角色在任何特定时间内在嘉年华会的位置。",
	"The reverse side of the poster map shows the Feywild domain of Prismeer, now divided into three splinter-realms called Hither, Thither, and Yon. Lodged between them is the Palace of Heart's Desire—the home of Prismeer's archfey ruler, Zybilna. This side of the map is meant to be shared with the players once the characters reach the palace, from where they can look out over the whole domain. DM-friendly versions of this map appear in {@adventure chapters 2|WBtW|2|Hither}, {@adventure 3|WBtW|3|Thither}, and {@adventure 4|WBtW|4|Yon}, to help you track the party's progress through Prismeer's splinter-realms.": "海报地图的反面显示了Prismeer的Feywild领域，现在分为三个分裂的王国，分别称为Hither、Thither和Yon。位于它们之间的是 \"心愿之宫\"--Prismeer的大帝统治者Zybilna的家。地图的这一面是为了在角色到达宫殿后与玩家分享的，在那里他们可以俯瞰整个领域。该地图的DM友好版本出现在{@adventure chapters 2|WBtW|2|Hither}、{@adventure 3|WBtW|3|Thither}和{@adventure 4|WBtW|4|Yon}中，以帮助你追踪党派在普利斯米尔分裂领域的进展。",
	"As you run {@i The Wild Beyond the Witchlight}, look for ways to bring the numbers eight and three to the fore. For example, characters who take a long rest in the fey domain of Prismeer might, without fail, be awakened by three songbirds at the end of the eighth hour.": "当你运行时（%0%），寻找方法将数字8和3带到前面。例如，在Prismeer的魔域中休息了很长时间的人物，在第八个小时结束时，可能会被三只鸣鸟唤醒。",
	"The number eight is symbolically important, as this adventure plays with the themes of time and nostalgia. The numeral 8 resembles an hourglass, which measures the passage of time, and looks like the symbol for infinity (∞) turned on its side. Hidden within the numeral 8 itself is the numeral 3. In the D&D multiverse, there exists the Rule of Three, which states that events of cosmic consequence often manifest in threes. Time, for instance, has a past, present, and future. The Hourglass Coven has three members. The fey domain of Prismeer is divided into three splinter-realms, which adventurers explore with the help of three guides.": "数字8具有重要的象征意义，因为这次冒险玩的是时间和怀旧的主题。数字8类似于一个沙漏，用来测量时间的流逝，看起来就像无限的符号（∞）被翻转过来。数字8本身隐藏着数字3。在D&D多元宇宙中，存在着 \"三法则\"，即具有宇宙性影响的事件往往以三的形式出现。例如，时间有过去、现在和未来。沙漏女巫团有三个成员。普利斯梅尔（Prismeer）的精灵领域被划分为三个不同的领域，冒险者在三个向导的帮助下探索这些领域。",
	"Hidden within the adventure are numerous other mentions of the numbers eight and three. Can you find them all?": "在这个冒险中还隐藏着许多其他提到的数字8和3。你能把它们都找出来吗？",
	"Maps that appear in this book are for your eyes only. As the characters explore locations on a given map, you can redraw portions of the map on graph paper, a wet-erase mat, or another surface to help your players visualize locations that might have unusual shapes or features. Your hand-drawn maps need not be faithful to the originals, and you can alter a map's features as you see fit. Nor do your maps need to be painstakingly rendered. You can omit details that are not readily visible (such as secret doors and other hidden features) until the characters are able to detect and interact with them.": "本书中出现的地图仅供您参考。当人物探索某张地图上的地点时，你可以在图画纸、湿擦笔垫或其他表面上重新绘制地图的部分内容，以帮助玩家直观地看到可能有不寻常形状或特征的地点。你的手绘地图不需要忠实于原作，你可以根据你的需要改变地图的特征。你的地图也不需要刻意渲染。你可以省略那些不容易看到的细节（如暗门和其他隐藏的特征），直到人物能够发现并与之互动。",
	"An arrow on a slope or staircase always points in the ascending direction.": "斜坡或楼梯上的箭头总是指向上升的方向。",
	"The poster map of Prismeer and the interior maps of Hither, Thither, and Yon show important landmarks that are described in the text. These landmarks are not drawn to scale.": "Prismeer的海报地图和Hither, Thither, and Yon的内部地图显示了文本中描述的重要地标。这些地标没有按比例绘制。",
	"This adventure uses a {@adventure Story Tracker|WBtW|11}, a copy of which is included at the back of this book. The Story Tracker is a note-keeping tool to help you remember important information about the characters and their accomplishments.": "这个冒险故事使用了一个（%0%），本书后面有一个副本。故事追踪器是一种记事工具，可以帮助你记住有关人物和他们成就的重要信息。",
	"At various times in the adventure, you will be advised to jot down information on the Story Tracker, as events that happen in earlier chapters can give characters an advantage in later chapters. The Story Tracker also allows you to record important details. For example, if a character falls under a curse, noting the specifics of the curse on the Story Tracker might remind you of the effect.": "在冒险的不同时期，你会被建议在故事追踪器上记下信息，因为在早期章节发生的事件可以使角色在后面的章节中获得优势。故事追踪器还允许你记录重要的细节。例如，如果一个角色受到了诅咒，在故事追踪器上记下诅咒的具体内容可能会提醒你注意其效果。",
	"A lost unicorn horn plays an important part in the adventure. Its location is determined randomly by rolling on the Unicorn Horn's Location table. Once you determine where the horn is, record its location on the {@adventure Story Tracker|WBtW|11}.": "一个丢失的独角兽角在冒险中起着重要作用。它的位置是通过在独角兽角的位置表上滚动随机确定的。一旦你确定了角的位置，就在{@adventure Story Tracker|WBtW|11}上记录它的位置。",
	"The horn belongs to a unicorn named Elidon, who was captured and transformed into a rocking horse by the Hourglass Coven. For more information about Elidon, see {@area area L6|24f|x} in {@adventure chapter 3|WBtW|3}.": "这只角属于一只名叫埃利顿的独角兽，它被沙漏女巫会抓住并变成了一匹摇摆马。关于埃利顿的更多信息，请参见{@adventure chapter 3|WBtW|3}中的{@area area L6|24f|x}。",

	"Most of this book is for the DM's eyes only, since it's full of secrets that your players won't discover until you run the adventure for them. That said, the adventure contains a lot of information that can be shared with the players at specific times, as discussed below.": "这本书的大部分内容都是给管理员看的，因为它充满了秘密，你的玩家在你为他们进行冒险之前不会发现这些秘密。也就是说，这个冒险包含了很多可以在特定时间与玩家分享的信息，如下文所述。",
	"During character creation, you can allow your players to read the new backgrounds and race options that appear in this introduction, if you're comfortable with allowing these options in your game.": "在创建角色的过程中，你可以让你的玩家阅读本介绍中出现的新背景和种族选项，如果你愿意在游戏中允许这些选项的话。",
	"When the characters acquire a new magic item and figure out what it does (see \"{@book Identifying a Magic Item|DMG|7|Identifying a Magic Item}\" in the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}), give that item's description to the players.": "当人物获得一个新的魔法物品并弄清楚它的作用时（见{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中的\"{@book Identifying a Magic Item|DMG|7|Identifying a Magic Item}\"），将该物品的描述给玩家。",
	"Creature stat blocks should be kept hidden from the players until circumstances warrant otherwise, as discussed below.": "生物状态块应该对玩家隐藏起来，除非情况需要，如下文所述。",
	"When characters make attacks against a creature, you compare those attacks to the creature's Armor Class to determine whether the attacks hit. After a certain number of hits and misses, players can usually pinpoint a creature's AC on their own. However, in the interest of speeding up combat, you can divulge a creature's AC once the characters have hit the creature at least once, allowing players to know without asking if attacks made against the creature hit or miss.": "当角色对生物进行攻击时，你将这些攻击与生物的护甲等级进行比较，以确定攻击是否击中。在经过一定数量的命中和未命中之后，玩家通常可以自己确定一个生物的护甲等级。然而，为了加快战斗速度，一旦角色至少击中生物一次，你就可以透露该生物的AC，让玩家不用问就能知道对该生物的攻击是否击中。",
	"It's better not to tell players how many hit points a creature has. However, you can give the players a sense of how well they're doing against the creature by describing, in narrative terms, how hurt the creature is. For example, if the creature has fewer than half its hit points remaining, you can describe it as being badly wounded or on the ropes. Such information gives the players a sense of accomplishment and might spur them to press the attack. On the other hand, if the characters aren't putting much of a dent in the creature's hit points, either because it has a lot of them or it has a trait such as Regeneration, it's a good idea to let the players know that the creature looks like it can take a lot more punishment. That information alone might encourage the players to consider a change of plan, such as a tactical retreat.": "最好不要告诉玩家一个生物有多少击打点。然而，你可以用叙述的方式让玩家感觉到他们对这个生物的表现如何。例如，如果该生物剩下的命中率不到一半，你就可以把它描述成受了重伤或濒临死亡。这样的信息给了玩家一种成就感，可能会刺激他们加强攻击。另一方面，如果角色们没有给生物的命中率带来多大的影响，要么是因为它的命中率很高，要么是因为它有再生这样的特性，那么让玩家知道这个生物看起来可以承受更多的惩罚是一个好主意。仅仅是这一信息就可以鼓励玩家考虑改变计划，比如进行战术撤退。",
	"Players need you to tell them how much damage their characters take and what type of damage it is. Whenever the adventure presents damage that is variable, it shows the average damage first, followed by a die expression in parentheses, like this: 10 ({@dice 3d6}). You decide whether to use the average or roll the dice. Using average damage speeds up play, but it might feel less exciting, and players can take advantage of its predictability. Rolling the dice takes more time but can yield more volatile results. In the interest of fairness, commit to one approach or the other for the duration of an encounter or game session.": "玩家需要你告诉他们，他们的角色受到多少伤害，是什么类型的伤害。每当冒险中出现的伤害是可变的，它首先显示的是平均伤害，然后是括号中的死亡表达式，像这样。10 ({@dice 3d6}). 你决定是使用平均数还是掷骰子。使用平均伤害可以加快游戏速度，但可能感觉不那么刺激，而且玩家可以利用其可预测性。掷骰子需要更多的时间，但可以产生更不稳定的结果。为了公平起见，在一场遭遇战或游戏环节中，应致力于使用一种方法。",
	"As their characters fight a creature, players expect to learn more about the creature's strengths, weaknesses, and abilities. It's okay to share such information with them as it becomes apparent. For example, you can describe a creature's wounds closing up when it regenerates.": "当他们的角色与生物战斗时，玩家希望了解更多关于该生物的力量、弱点和能力。当这些信息变得明显时，与他们分享这些信息是可以的。例如，你可以描述一个生物在再生时的伤口会闭合。",
	"Characters don't need to fight a creature to know certain facts about it. For example, a character who has the Witchlight hand background and chose a sprite for a carnival companion would know a lot about sprites, including their ability to turn {@condition invisible}. Similarly, if a character intuits that a {@creature treant}, being a creature made of wood, has vulnerability to fire damage, just smile faintly and say, \"That's a reasonable hypothesis.\" If the treant takes double damage from a {@spell fireball} spell, be sure to let players know how badly the fire hurt it.": "角色不需要与一个生物战斗就能知道关于它的某些事实。例如，一个拥有巫师之光手背景的角色，选择了一个精灵作为狂欢节的同伴，就会知道很多关于精灵的事情，包括它们转身的能力（%0%）。同样地，如果一个角色直觉到一个（%1%），作为木头做的生物，对火的伤害有脆弱性，就淡淡地笑着说：\"这是一个合理的假设。\" 如果树人受到（%2%）法术的双重伤害，一定要让玩家知道火对它的伤害有多大。",
	"Don't be afraid to dole out information to characters who have the applicable knowledge. If you're not sure whether the characters possess such knowledge, have them make an Intelligence check (see the {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG} for more guidance about {@book ability checks|DMG|8|Ability Checks}), and share the information if one or more characters succeed on the check.": "不要害怕向拥有相关知识的角色提供信息。如果你不确定这些角色是否拥有这些知识，可以让他们进行智力检查（参见{@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}中关于{@book ability checks|DMG|8|Ability Checks}的更多指导），如果一个或多个角色检查成功，就可以分享这些信息。",
	"Many DMs like to roll their dice in the open, for all the players to see, to maintain transparency. Other DMs prefer to roll dice behind a screen to maintain suspense. Either approach is fine.": "许多管理员喜欢在公开场合掷骰子，让所有的玩家都看到，以保持透明度。其他DM喜欢在屏幕后面掷骰子以保持悬念。两种方法都可以。",
	"Even DMs who conceal their dice rolls might divulge certain results. For example, when a creature scores a critical hit against a character, it's customary to let the player know that their character just took a particularly nasty hit before revealing how much damage was dealt.": "即使是隐瞒骰子结果的管理员也可能泄露某些结果。例如，当一个生物对一个角色造成关键打击时，通常会让玩家知道他们的角色刚刚受到了特别严重的打击，然后再透露造成了多少伤害。",
	"It's okay to ask one of your players to make a die roll for you. For example, if you plan to use one of this adventure's random encounters, you can have a player roll to determine what the characters encounter, rather than making the roll yourself.": "让你的一个玩家为你掷骰子是可以的。例如，如果你打算使用这个冒险中的一个随机遭遇，你可以让一个玩家掷骰子来决定角色遇到什么，而不是自己掷骰子。",
	"Important information that doesn't appear in boxed text is usually communicated to players through roleplaying. As the DM, you roleplay all the creatures that the characters encounter in the adventure. Many of the DM-controlled creatures (also called nonplayer characters, or NPCs) in this adventure know information that the characters can learn through inquiry. The adventure outlines the most likely circumstances under which a creature will share what it knows.": "没有出现在方框内的重要信息通常是通过角色扮演传达给玩家的。作为DM，你要对角色在冒险中遇到的所有生物进行角色扮演。在这个冒险中，许多由DM控制的生物（也叫非玩家角色，或NPC）知道的信息，角色可以通过询问了解。冒险中概述了最有可能的情况，在这种情况下，生物会分享它所知道的东西。",
	"The adventure describes important creatures in detail, while creatures of little consequence get no more than a passing reference. As such, you have enough information to bring important creatures to life, but not so much that it becomes a chore to remember all the details. The adventure seldom goes so far as to describe what a creature sounds like, nor does it reveal everything that a creature might say or do. You're expected to improvise and bring creatures to life as best you can. For example, the adventure describes {@creature Mister Light|WBtW} (one of the owners of the Witchlight Carnival) as a flamboyant figure, but you get to decide what his voice sounds like and how he reacts to a given situation, based on what the adventure says about him. You can also ignore what the text says and roleplay {@creature Mister Light|WBtW} or any other creature as you see fit.": "冒险中详细描述了重要的生物，而对一些无关紧要的生物则只是顺便提一下。因此，你有足够的信息让重要的生物活起来，但又不至于让你记住所有的细节成为一件麻烦事。冒险很少描述一个生物的声音，也没有揭示一个生物可能说或做的一切。你应该即兴发挥，尽你所能将生物带入生活。例如，冒险中描述（%0%）（巫师之光狂欢节的主人之一）是一个浮夸的人物，但你可以根据冒险中关于他的描述，决定他的声音是什么样的，以及他对特定情况的反应。你也可以无视文本中的内容，按你认为合适的方式来扮演{@creature Mister Light|WBtW}或任何其他生物。",
	"{@adventure Appendix B|WBtW|7} contains information that will help you roleplay a handful of important DM-controlled characters whose actions propel and shape the narrative of the adventure. The cards in {@adventure appendix D|WBtW|9} serve much the same purpose but are optional; they provide roleplaying notes for several other colorful characters who aren't as pivotal. You can photocopy these cards, cut them out, and keep them in a handy stack behind your DM screen, sorted alphabetically or grouped by chapter. (The latter option works better if you expect the current game session to focus entirely on one chapter of the adventure.)": "{@adventure Appendix B|WBtW|7}包含的信息将帮助你扮演少数几个由DM控制的重要角色，他们的行为推动并塑造了冒险的叙述。(1%)中的卡片也有同样的作用，但却是可有可无的；它们为其他几个不那么关键的彩色角色提供了角色扮演的说明。你可以复印这些卡片，把它们剪下来，放在你的DM屏幕后面，按字母排序或按章节分组，很方便。(如果你希望当前的游戏环节完全集中在冒险的某一章，那么后一种选择会更好）。",

	"Madryck doesn't need to have a past relationship with any of the characters, but if the players want to tie Madryck more closely to their characters' back stories, allow it. Madryck is a {@creature mage} (neutral good) who speaks Common, Sylvan, and two other languages of your choice. Although he has been out of touch with Zybilna for almost a year, he knows that time passes differently in parts of the Feywild, including Zybilna's realm of Prismeer. He can't predict how much time it will take for the characters to complete their quest; they might come back in a matter of days, or years could pass on the Material Plane before they return. Not wanting to alarm the characters, Madryck tries to steer the conversation away from issues involving the passage of time, if one or more characters mention something about it.": "Madryck不需要与任何角色有过去的关系，但如果玩家想把Madryck与他们的角色的背景故事更紧密地联系起来，请允许。马德里克是一个{@creature mage}（中立的好人），会说普通话、希尔文语和另外两种你选择的语言。虽然他已经和Zybilna失去联系将近一年了，但他知道在Feywild的部分地区，包括Zybilna的Prismeer领域，时间的流逝是不同的。他无法预测这些人物需要多少时间来完成他们的任务；他们可能几天就回来了，也可能在物质世界里过了几年才回来。由于不想惊动人物，如果一个或多个人物提到时间流逝的问题，马德莱克会尽量引导谈话远离这个问题。",
	"If the characters request more information about the Witchlight Carnival, Madryck says that he hasn't visited the carnival in sixty-four years and admits that a lot can change in that time. He advises the characters to explore the carnival thoroughly on their own. He doesn't presume to know what form the fey crossing currently takes or how well hidden and protected it is. He does provide the following reliable information:": "如果人物要求得到更多关于巫师之光狂欢节的信息，马德里克说他已经六十四年没有来过狂欢节了，并承认在这段时间内会有很多变化。他建议人物自己去彻底探索狂欢节。他并不自以为是地知道目前飞越的形式是什么，也不知道它有多大的隐蔽性和保护性。他确实提供了以下可靠信息。",

	"Three days ago, you were approached by a friendly faerie dragon in the service of a human warlock named Madryck Roslof. This faerie dragon foretold the arrival of adventurers seeking a path to the Feywild through the carnival. Although you've heard that the carnival contains a fey crossing, you've never gone to the trouble of finding it. The faerie dragon thought you might want to help these adventurers. It even went so far as to imply that the fate of the Witchlight Carnival might hinge on the success of their endeavors.": "三天前，一条友好的精灵龙找到了你，它为一个名叫马德里克-罗斯洛夫的人类术士服务。这条精灵龙预言了冒险者的到来，他们将通过狂欢节寻找通往精灵世界的道路。虽然你听说嘉年华会有一条通往翡冷翠的通道，但你从未费尽心思去寻找它。小精灵龙认为你可能想要帮助这些冒险者。它甚至暗示，巫师之光狂欢节的命运可能取决于他们努力的成功。",

	"How Witch and Light came to possess the carnival is a story worth telling. Under different names, they owned another carnival that prowled the edges of the Shadowfell. The two carnivals crossed paths many years ago, and after much wine was consumed, the owners could not agree on which carnival was the better of the two, so they decided it would be great fun to swap ownership. Isolde, the eladrin who ran the fey-themed carnival, traded places with the two shadar-kai who ran the shadow-themed carnival. This arrangement would last until the two carnivals met again, which has not yet happened.": "巫师和光是如何拥有这个狂欢节的，这是一个值得讲述的故事。在不同的名字下，他们拥有另一个游荡在阴影地带边缘的嘉年华会。这两个嘉年华会在多年前有过交集，在喝了很多酒之后，主人无法就两个嘉年华会中哪个更好达成一致，所以他们决定交换所有权会很有趣。伊索德，那个经营以精灵为主题的狂欢节的精灵，与经营以影子为主题的狂欢节的两个沙达凯人交换了位置。这种安排将持续到两个嘉年华会再次相遇，但这还没有发生。",
	"After trading their sinister carnival for a more lighthearted one, the two shadar-kai took the names Witch and Light.

They have no desire to return to their gloomy old carnival, which is described in more detail in {@book Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft|VRGR}.": "在用阴险的狂欢节换取更轻松的狂欢节后，这两个沙达凯取名为巫婆和光。渐渐地，这些情绪低落、情感迟钝的Shadar-kai变成了爱玩的自由精神，他们暗自害怕有一天两个嘉年华会再次相交。他们不愿意回到他们阴郁的旧狂欢节，这在{@book Van Richten's Guide to Ravenloft|VRGR}中有更详细的描述。",
	"The shadar-kai are aware that the Hourglass Coven has usurped Zybilna's domain in the Feywild. They don't know how the coven accomplished this coup, but Witch and Light would like nothing more than to see the hags defeated and Zybilna returned to power. But they dare not play a part in making that dream a reality. If the coven caught a whiff of dissent from Witch and Light, the hags would punish the shadar-kai for their impudence (see the \"Witch and Light's Hourglass Pact\" sidebar). Witch and Light do what they can to appease the hags while secretly rooting for Zybilna's return. They know Zybilna's true identity but dare not reveal it.": "shadar-kai知道沙漏女巫团已经篡夺了Zybilna在Feywild的领地。他们不知道女巫会是如何完成这次政变的，但女巫和光明最希望看到的是女巫被打败，Zybilna重获权力。但他们不敢在实现这一梦想的过程中扮演任何角色。如果女巫和光的异见被女巫和光发现，女巫们会因为他们的厚颜无耻而惩罚沙达凯（见 \"女巫和光的沙漏契约 \"边栏）。巫婆和光明尽其所能安抚女巫，同时暗中支持Zybilna的回归。他们知道Zybilna的真实身份，但不敢透露。",

	"Witch, who used to go by the name Naeryx Krumple, spent his youth as a homeless orphan, eking out a meager and dreary existence on the fog-shrouded streets of Gloomwrought, a city in the Shadowfell. He earned a few coppers selling broadsheets as a young boy, then later swept floors until an old clock tower keeper took him on as a helper. The tower's clock was in such poor condition that it would break down often. Naeryx helped with the repairs and found that the work gave him a sliver of joy. When the old keeper died years later, Naeryx replaced him.": "巫师，曾用名Naeryx Krumple，年轻时是个无家可归的孤儿，在阴影地带的城市Gloomwrought的雾气笼罩的街道上过着微薄而沉闷的生活。他小时候卖大字报赚了几个铜板，后来又扫地，直到一个老钟楼看守人收留他做帮手。塔里的钟状况很差，经常会坏掉。Naeryx帮助修理，发现这项工作给他带来了一丝快乐。几年后，老看守人去世，Naeryx取代了他。",
	"The wealthy family that owned the clock tower didn't pay Naeryx a lot of money for his work, but they occasionally had him over for dinner. He owned one fine suit that he wore on such occasions, and though he didn't care for the family's matriarch or patriarch, he enjoyed the company of their eldest son, Urmius Umbrage—a brooding shadar-kai ne'er-do-well with a cruel sense of humor. Naeryx and Urmius were close in age and got along well in all respects. Years later, without informing the rest of his family, Urmius bought a run-down carnival and persuaded Naeryx to help him operate it. Naeryx and Urmius—now calling themselves {@creature Mister Witch|WBtW} and {@creature Mister Light|WBtW}—have been partners and collaborators ever since.": "拥有钟楼的富裕家庭并没有因为他的工作而付给Naeryx很多钱，但他们偶尔会请他来吃饭。他拥有一套精美的西装，在这样的场合穿，虽然他不关心这个家庭的族长或家长，但他喜欢他们的长子Urmius Umbrag--一个忧郁的Shadar-kai ne'er-do-well，具有残酷的幽默感。Naeryx和Urmius年龄相仿，在各方面都相处得很好。几年后，在没有通知家人的情况下，Urmius买下了一个破旧的狂欢节，并说服Naeryx帮助他经营。Naeryx和Urmius--现在称自己为{@creature Mister Witch|WBtW}和{@creature Mister Light|WBtW}--从那时起一直是伙伴和合作者。",
	"{@creature Mister Witch|WBtW} looks like a distinguished gentleman, for he is always dressed in fine attire.

	"Light, formerly known as Urmius Umbrage, belonged to a filthy rich shadar-kai family that haunted a crumbling mansion in Gloomwrought. Although he wanted for nothing as a child, Urmius found himself surrounded by family members, caretakers, and teachers who were uniformly cold, callous, and mean-spirited. He grew tired of being seen as nothing more than the inheritor of the Umbrage estate and legacy, and he did everything in his power to make life miserable for everyone around him, especially his parents. He seemed bereft of ambition and spent much of his time playing in his room. He collected costumes and liked nothing more than to parade around Umbrage Mansion in strange garments and outlandish makeup.": "光，原名Urmius Umbrage，属于一个肮脏富有的Shadar-kai家族，在Gloomwrought的一座破败的豪宅里出没。虽然他从小就一无所求，但乌尔米乌斯发现自己身边的家庭成员、看护人和老师都是一致的冷漠、无情和刻薄。他渐渐厌倦了被看作是安布雷格财产和遗产的继承人，他尽其所能地使他周围的人，特别是他的父母生活得很痛苦。他似乎没有野心，大部分时间都在自己的房间里玩。他收集服装，只喜欢穿着奇怪的衣服，化着怪异的妆，在安柏拉格大厦周围游行。",
	"Urmius first met Naeryx Krumple at a family dinner and didn't think much of the clock tower keeper at first. But Urmius found himself taken aback by Naeryx's ability to find even a small amount of joy in his work. He was eager to get to know Naeryx better, though it took a while for Naeryx to trust him. After getting his hands on some money, Urmius bought a sad little carnival that was camped on the outskirts of Gloomwrought and asked Naeryx to help him run it. For Urmius, the carnival was a chance to emerge from under his family's shadow and become the master of his own fate, but it also meant forsaking his inheritance in order to embrace the unconventional lifestyle, fashions, and friendships he desired.": "乌尔米乌斯在一次家庭晚宴上第一次见到奈瑞克斯-克鲁普尔，起初对这个钟楼看守人没有什么想法。但Urmius发现自己被Naeryx在工作中找到哪怕一点点快乐的能力吓了一跳。他渴望更好地了解Naeryx，尽管Naeryx花了一些时间来信任他。在拿到一些钱后，乌尔米乌斯买下了一个在格洛姆沃特郊区扎营的悲惨的小嘉年华，并请纳瑞克斯帮助他经营。对乌尔米乌斯来说，嘉年华会是一个机会，让他从家庭的阴影下走出来，成为自己命运的主人，但这也意味着放弃了他的遗产，以接受他所期望的非传统的生活方式、时尚和友谊。",
	"{@creature Mister Light|WBtW} has a slender frame. He is always dressed in some sort of costume and is rarely seen in public without makeup. He carries around a fancy weather vane given to him by the carnival's previous owner. He twirls it and waves it around like a fool's scepter, but its power is far greater than he lets on. With this magic vane, he can affect the mood of everyone in the Witchlight Carnival.": "{@creature Mister Light|WBtW}有一个纤细的框架。他总是穿着某种服装，很少在公众场合看到他不化妆。他随身带着一个花哨的风向标，是嘉年华会的前主人送给他的。他旋转着它，像傻瓜的权杖一样挥舞着，但它的力量远比他说的要大。有了这个神奇的风向标，他可以影响巫师之光狂欢节中所有人的情绪。",

Kettlesteam, a kenku warlock, used a {@spell speak with animals} spell to panic the dragonfly. Characters can spot Kettlesteam before she slips away with a successful Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check contested by the kenku's Charisma ({@skill Deception}) check. See \"{@area Catching Kettlesteam|0e7|x}\" later in the chapter if the characters try to confront her.": "当人物的第一次骑行开始时，附近的荷花池中爆发出惊呼声。一只巨大的蜻蜓刚刚带着背上的食客提前起飞：一个留着亮蓝色胡须的中年矮人坐在马具上没有系紧。Kettlesteam，一个Kenku术士，使用了一个{@spell speak with animals}的法术来惊吓蜻蜓。角色可以在Kettlesteam溜走之前发现她，并通过智慧（（%%1%））检查和Kenku的魅力（（%%2%））检查成功。如果角色试图与她对抗，请参见本章后面的\"{@area Catching Kettlesteam|0e7|x}\"。",

Stilt-walkers pluck fruit from trees; musicians drum, pipe, and strum; and everywhere there is singing, dancing, and an inordinate amount of custard.": "音乐和欢笑从这个公园里散发出来。空气中飘荡着鲜花、蜂蜜酒和浆果派的迷人香味。漫步者从树上摘下水果；音乐家们打鼓、吹管、弹琴；到处都是歌声、舞蹈和过多的奶油蛋糕。",

	"This gnome bard (\"Tumblestrum\" to her friends) is in the Feasting Orchard when the characters first arrive. She sits on a swing that hangs from the branch of a pear tree, plucking the strings on her lute while eyeing the characters.

When pressed for more information, she cryptically assures the characters that they're exactly where and when they're supposed to be but says no more.": "这个地精吟游诗人（她的朋友们称之为 \"Tumblestrum\"）在人物刚到的时候就在盛宴果园。她坐在挂在梨树枝上的秋千上，一边弹着她的琵琶，一边注视着这些人物。如果人物碰巧提到他们的免费门票，她就会透露是她付的钱。当被问及更多信息时，她隐晦地向人物保证，他们确实在他们应该去的地方和时间，但没有说更多。",
	"As the night progresses, Tumblestrum can reappear to provide hints about what the group needs to do; she can even guide the characters to Prismeer if all of their plans fall through (see \"Tumblestrum's Intervention\" in the \"{@area Timed Events|0eb|x}\" section later in the chapter). If she is threatened, she disappears in a flashy yet harmless pyrotechnic display. No stat block for Tumblestrum is necessary, since she won't harm or hinder the characters and can't be seriously harmed by them. Her thoughts are likewise hidden, since no magic can read them.": "随着夜幕的降临，Tumblestrum可以再次出现，为他们提供有关需要做什么的提示；如果他们的计划都失败了，她甚至可以引导他们去找Prismeer（见本章后面\"{@area Timed Events|0eb|x} \"部分的 \"Tumblestrum的干预\"）。如果她受到威胁，她会在一个华丽但无害的烟火表演中消失。没有必要为Tumblestrum设置状态块，因为她不会伤害或阻碍人物，也不会被他们严重伤害。她的思想也同样被隐藏起来，因为没有魔法可以读取它们。",
	"Tumblestrum is meant to be an enigma to the player characters. In truth, she is a savvy planar traveler who has visited and entertained folks on countless worlds. In some corners of the multiverse, she is what's known as a Planeswalker—a fiercely independent and extremely powerful entity not to be trifled with. Tumblestrum disapproves of the Hourglass Coven's cruelty and aims to deliver some much-needed comeuppance. The gnome sees the characters as agents of change who can undo some of the damage caused by the coven, and she suspects that if they do so, the characters will be on their way to becoming heroes worthy of epic ballads.": "Tumblestrum对于玩家角色来说是个谜。事实上，她是一个精明的星球旅行者，曾经访问过无数个世界，并为人们提供娱乐。在多元宇宙的某些角落，她是所谓的 \"行者\"（Planeswalker）--一个激烈的、独立的、极其强大的实体，不容小觑。Tumblestrum不赞成沙漏女巫团的残忍行为，并旨在提供一些亟需的惩罚。地精认为这些人物是变革的推动者，他们可以消除女巫团造成的一些损害，她怀疑如果他们这样做了，这些人物就会成为配得上史诗民谣的英雄。",

Witch and Light are good guys, but you'll need leverage to make them spill the beans.\"": "伯利摘下了他的千斤顶头盔，露出了担忧的表情。\"嘉年华会发生坏事已经有一段时间了。人和物一直在失踪。我的老板们知道的比他们说的要多，但他们的手不知为何被绑住了。你们是我遇到的第一个可能能够纠正事情的人。巫师和光是好人，但你需要杠杆作用来使他们吐露心声。\"",
	"Burly suggests the characters purloin {@creature Mister Witch|WBtW}'s {@item Witchlight watch|WBtW} (without which the carnival can't stay on schedule) and use it to compel Witch and Light to provide the answers they seek. He proposes that the best time to swipe the watch is during the Big Top Extravaganza, since it's the only time when Witch and Light are separated. Although he doesn't condone theft, Burly has talked himself into believing that it's not really stealing if the characters give back the watch. Burly offers to assist where he can, but he doesn't want Witch and Light to know that he plotted against them, because it would cost him his job and his home. He also warns that he'll see no harm come to his bosses; they might be flawed, but without them, the carnival will fall apart.": "伯利建议这些人物偷取{@creature Mister Witch|WBtW}的{@item Witchlight watch|WBtW}（没有它，狂欢节就不能按计划进行），并利用它来迫使女巫和光明提供他们所寻求的答案。他提议，盗取手表的最佳时间是在大顶棚盛会期间，因为这是唯一一个女巫和光明分开的时间。虽然他并不宽恕偷窃行为，但Burly已经说服自己相信，如果角色们把手表还给他们，那就不是真正的偷窃。伯利表示愿意提供力所能及的帮助，但他不想让女巫和光明知道他谋害了他们，因为这将使他失去工作和家。他还警告说，他不会看到他的老板受到伤害；他们可能有缺陷，但没有他们，狂欢节就会崩溃。",
	"Over the course of the conversation, Burly shares the following additional pieces of information:": "在谈话过程中，伯力分享了以下额外信息。",
	"\"The Witchlight Monarch is chosen by {@creature Mister Light|WBtW}'s {@item Witchlight vane|WBtW}.

	"If the characters suggest stealing the {@item Witchlight vane|WBtW} instead of the {@item Witchlight watch|WBtW}, Burly asserts that the watch is easier to steal because it's smaller and often tucked in {@creature Mister Witch|WBtW}'s pocket, whereas {@creature Mister Light|WBtW} is rarely seen without the vane in hand. Burly concedes, however, that the vane yields almost as much leverage in negotiations with Witch and Light, though he has no plan for stealing the vane.": "如果角色们建议偷{@item Witchlight vane|WBtW}而不是{@item Witchlight watch|WBtW}，Burly断言，手表更容易被偷，因为它更小，而且经常被塞在{@creature Mister Witch|WBtW}的口袋里，而{@creature Mister Light|WBtW}很少看到没有风向标在手。然而，Burly承认，在与女巫和光明的谈判中，风向标几乎可以产生同样多的筹码，尽管他没有计划去偷风向标。",

	"The Palace of Heart's Desire can be glimpsed through veils of mist from certain vantage points in all three of Prismeer's splinter-realms.

	"Although Zybilna is indisposed, three of the rules she put into place when she created her Feywild domain continue to hold weight: the rule of hospitality, the rule of ownership, and the rule of reciprocity. These three rules are common knowledge in Prismeer, and both natives and visitors would do well to abide by them:": "虽然Zybilna身体不适，但她在创建Feywild领域时制定的三条规则仍然很重要：好客的规则、所有权的规则和互惠的规则。这三条规则在普利斯米尔是众所周知的，无论是本地人还是游客，都会很好地遵守它们。",
	"When a friend, an enemy, or a stranger enters your home, you are expected to be gracious and accommodating to them until such time as they prove, by their words or actions, undeserving of such hospitality.": "当一个朋友、一个敌人或一个陌生人进入你的家时，你应该对他们感到亲切和包容，直到他们通过自己的言行证明不值得这样的款待。",
	"You must not steal from a friend, an enemy, or a stranger. To take something that doesn't belong to you without the rightful owner's permission is a crime and an unforgivable breach of etiquette.": "你不能从朋友、敌人或陌生人那里偷东西。在没有合法主人的允许下拿走不属于你的东西是一种犯罪，是对礼仪的一种不可原谅的违反。",
	"When a friend, an enemy, or a stranger offers you a gift, you are obliged to accept it and offer something of comparable value (be it a gift or a service) in return. Such reciprocation need not happen immediately.": "当朋友、敌人或陌生人向你提供礼物时，你有义务接受它，并提供价值相当的东西（无论是礼物还是服务）作为回报。这种回报不需要立即发生。",
	"When Zybilna ruled Prismeer, few of her subjects dared to violate her rules. Those who did often disappeared without a trace. Now, with the Hourglass Coven in charge, the rules remain in force, though the circumstances are different. The hags believe strongly in hospitality and reciprocity, but they have a self-centered view of ownership—each claims ownership of everything in her realm. (For example, {@creature Bavlorna Blightstraw|WBtW} considers herself the owner of Hither and everything in it.)": "当Zybilna统治Prismeer时，她的臣民中很少有人敢于违反她的规则。那些违反规则的人常常消失得无影无踪。现在，随着沙漏女巫团的掌管，这些规则仍然有效，尽管情况有所不同。女巫们坚信好客和互惠，但她们对所有权有一种以自我为中心的看法--每个人都声称拥有她领域里的一切。(例如，{@creature Bavlorna Blightstraw|WBtW}认为自己是Hither的主人，以及其中的一切。）",
	"Also, the hags are far less inclined to punish those who break the rules than Zybilna was, and it's not even clear to other residents of Prismeer when a rule has been broken. For example, brigands are able to take what they want from other folk without paying for it, and nothing bad seems to happen to them as a result, but that fact alone is not enough to encourage most others to likewise break the rules—for all they know, the brigands might be acting in the hags' interests.": "而且，女巫们远不如Zybilna那样倾向于惩罚那些违反规则的人，而且对于Prismeer的其他居民来说，甚至不清楚什么时候规则被打破了。例如，强盗们能够从其他居民那里拿走他们想要的东西而不付钱，而且他们似乎没有因此而发生什么坏事，但仅仅这一事实还不足以鼓励大多数其他人同样违反规则--他们知道，强盗们可能是为了女巫们的利益而行动。",
	"If Zybilna were to return to power, strict enforcement of the rules would resume in a heartbeat, and brigands would be wise to take their propensity for malfeasance elsewhere.": "如果Zybilna重新掌权，严格的规则执行将在瞬间恢复，强盗们会明智地把他们的渎职倾向带到其他地方。",
	"In this chapter and in later chapters, the characters might encounter children who were lured to Prismeer from the Witchlight Carnival or who stumbled into Zybilna's domain by other means. These children have been stuck in Prismeer long enough to forget about the worlds they came from, yet they haven't aged much at all.": "在这一章和以后的章节中，人物可能会遇到从巫师之光狂欢节被引诱到Prismeer的孩子，或者通过其他方式偶然进入Zybilna的领域。这些孩子被困在Prismeer的时间足够长，以至于忘记了他们来自的世界，但他们根本就没怎么老。",
	"Zybilna's magic protects all children in Prismeer (but not creatures disguised as children). The hags of the Hourglass Coven are aware of this magic and unable to dispel it. Any child in Prismeer who would take damage as a consequence of another creature's actions vanishes in a burst of multicolored light and is spirited away to a safe corner of Prismeer, unharmed and unreachable from the domain's splinter-realms or the palace, until Zybilna wills the child to return to her. Children sequestered in this fashion are beyond the reach of everyone else and can't be located or scried upon using magic.": "Zybilna的魔法保护着Prismeer的所有儿童（但不包括伪装成儿童的生物）。沙漏女巫团的女巫们都知道这个魔法，并且无法驱散它。Prismeer中的任何儿童如果因为其他生物的行为而受到伤害，就会在一阵五颜六色的光芒中消失，并被带到Prismeer的一个安全角落，不受伤害，也无法从领域的分裂领域或宫殿中到达，直到Zybilna希望这个孩子回到她身边。以这种方式被封存的孩子是其他人无法触及的，而且无法被找到，也无法使用魔法进行搜救。",
	"Prismeer, like other Feywild domains, is shaped by the emotions of the creatures that inhabit it. Even creatures of little consequence can transform the domain in minor ways as long as no other, more powerful force is exerting its influence. For example, flowers might wilt in the presence of a goblin who is terribly unhappy. Similarly, a satyr's laughter might cause a smile to appear on the trunk of an inanimate tree nearby. A more powerful creature, such as a hag, can reshape a larger portion of the domain to reflect their emotional state. An archfey is so attuned to the Feywild that their emotions can suffuse an entire domain, overriding the emotional influence of all other creatures in it. From that standpoint, Zybilna's dormancy enables other creatures to affect Prismeer more than they could if she were still active.": "Prismeer，像其他Feywild领域一样，被居住在其中的生物的情绪所塑造。只要没有其他更强大的力量在施加影响，即使是没什么影响的生物也能以微小的方式改变这个领域。例如，在一个非常不开心的妖精面前，花朵可能会枯萎。同样，一个萨提尔的笑声可能会使附近无生命的树干上出现一个微笑。一个更强大的生物，如女巫，可以重塑领域的更大部分以反映他们的情绪状态。一个大法师与精灵世界如此契合，他们的情绪可以充斥整个领域，凌驾于所有其他生物的情绪影响之上。从这个角度看，兹比娜的休眠使其他生物能够比她仍然活跃时更多地影响普利斯梅尔。",
	"As the characters make their way across the splintered realms of Prismeer, any emotional outburst or change in mood they exhibit might be accompanied by a minor reaction in the environment, which you can determine by choosing an entry that you like from the Domain Transformation table or by rolling on the table to determine a random result. Not every emotion felt in Prismeer is worthy of a roll on the table; you can save these effects for occasions when emotions are running high, to remind your players that the Feywild is not like the Material Plane. Because these effects have no impact on the story, you can forgo using the table if you want.": "当角色在Prismeer的分裂领域中前进时，他们表现出的任何情绪爆发或情绪变化都可能伴随着环境中的轻微反应，你可以通过从领域转换表中选择一个你喜欢的条目来确定，或者通过在表中滚动来确定一个随机结果。并非每一种在普利斯梅尔感受到的情绪都值得在桌子上滚动；你可以把这些效果留到情绪高涨的场合，以提醒你的玩家，仙界与物质世界不同。因为这些效果对故事没有影响，如果你愿意，你可以放弃使用这个表格。",
	"If Zybilna is released from her temporal stasis, the ability of other creatures to alter her domain is suppressed until she is {@condition incapacitated}, killed, or no longer in Prismeer.": "如果Zybilna从她的时空静止中被释放出来，其他生物改变她的领域的能力会被抑制，直到她被{@condition incapacitated}，被杀死，或者不再在Prismeer。",

	"This encounter can occur when the swamp's water level is low. Five {@creature Mud Mephit||mud mephits} emerge from the muck around the characters and threaten to drag them down into it unless they can guess the mephits' favorite food. The answer, of course, is mud pie. Each character gets one guess. If a character guesses correctly, the mephits cackle maniacally, dive back under the muck, and disappear.

	"This encounter takes place in a mist-veiled field of tall swamp grass dotted with clusters of cattails. It begins when the characters hear rustling in the vegetation ahead of them.

	"As the stilt walkers advance, the characters recognize them as six {@creature Hobgoblin||hobgoblins} (lawful neutral) who are wearing patchwork rags and furs (AC 12). Strapped to the back of each stilt walker is a wire cage padded with straw and filled with {@dice 1d20} eggs of various sizes and colors.

The hobgoblins are not violent toward strangers.": "随着高跷的前进，人物认出他们是六个（%0%）（合法中立），他们穿着拼凑的破布和毛皮（AC12）。每个高跷的背上都绑着一个铁丝笼子，里面垫着稻草，装满了不同大小和颜色的（1%）鸡蛋。这些妖精在沼泽地里搜寻爬行动物和鸟类的蛋，他们或者吃这些蛋，或者把它们交易给（%%2%）的恶棍（本章后面会介绍）。妖精们对陌生人并不暴力。",
	"If they are left alone, the stilt walkers pass by the characters without so much as a greeting. If the characters try to communicate, the stilt walkers stop and regard them silently for a moment before prompting them to continue.

	"When the water level of the swamp is low, the characters chance upon a 10-foot-wide stream.

	"Each suit of animated armor mimics the movements of the character closest to it. For example, if the character closest to a suit of armor swings a sword, the armor makes a similar gesture, though it wields no weapons.

	"The following encounters are tied to locations marked on the map of Hither. Move these locations as needed to put them in the characters' path, and chalk up any discrepancy with the map to the shifty nature of the Feywild. (The Feywild is known to play tricks on travelers, redirecting them without their knowledge to places they are meant to go. Consequently, the characters might think they're heading toward one part of Hither, only to find themselves arriving somewhere else.) Ideally, you should run all three encounters in the following order before the characters arrive at Downfall:": "下面的遭遇与Hither地图上标记的地点相关联。请根据需要移动这些地点，使其位于角色的路径上，并将任何与地图的差异归结为妖精的狡猾本质。(众所周知，Feywild会捉弄旅行者，在他们不知情的情况下将他们转到他们本该去的地方。因此，角色们可能会认为他们正朝着Hither的某个地方前进，但却发现自己来到了其他地方）。理想情况下，你应该在人物到达下城之前按以下顺序进行这三个遭遇战。",

When the characters arrive, Charm is gossiping with Bavlorna about the hag's sisters, Endelyn and Skabatha. The conversation is a distraction, buying time for Charm's shadow to perpetrate a heist in area B19. Characters who have a passive Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) score of 13 or higher notice that the black-clad figure doesn't cast a shadow. This is not a trait that darklings possess, but rather the result of Endelyn's using her {@item scissors of shadow snipping|WBtW} (see {@adventure appendix A|WBtW|6}) to cut loose Charm's shadow and transform it into a separate creature. See {@adventure chapter 4|WBtW|4} for more information on Endelyn and her magic scissors.": "穿着黑衣的高大修长的身影是Charm，一个{@creature darkling elder|VGM}（见附录C），他为{@creature Endelyn Moongrave|WBtW}做贼，但冒充旅行商人。当人物到达时，Charm正在和Bavlorna闲谈，谈论女巫的姐妹Endelyn和Skabatha。他们的谈话是为了转移注意力，为Charm的影子在B19区实施抢劫争取时间。被动智慧（{@skill Perception}）得分在13分以上的角色注意到这个黑衣人并没有投下阴影。这并不是黑衣人拥有的特性，而是恩德林用她的{@item scissors of shadow snipping|WBtW}(见{@adventure appendix A|WBtW|6})切断了Charm的影子并把它变成一个独立的生物的结果。关于恩德林和她的魔法剪刀的更多信息，见{@adventure chapter 4|WBtW|4}。",

	"Bavlorna's Big Book of Bad Blood has gone missing. It contains copious notes on everyone who has wronged her.

	"If you used the \"Lost Things\" adventure hook and the {@adventure Story Tracker|WBtW|11} indicates that Bavlorna has one or more things in her possession that the characters desire, she agrees to give up these items on one condition: she wants the characters to steal a portrait of her older sister, Skabatha, and deliver it to Bavlorna's cottage within eight days. Bavlorna provides three pieces of information before spitting into her hand and requiring the characters to shake it, thus sealing the bargain:": "如果你使用了 \"丢失的东西 \"冒险钩子，并且{@adventure Story Tracker|WBtW|11}表明Bavlorna有一件或多件人物想要的东西，她同意放弃这些东西，但有一个条件：她要人物偷一张她姐姐Skabatha的画像，并在八天内把它送到Bavlorna的小屋里。Bavlorna提供了三条信息，然后向她的手吐口水，要求人物握手，从而完成交易。",

While cursed in this way, the character loses one cherished possession (chosen by you). This possession disappears and is not regained until the curse ends. Bavlorna can end the curse on a character (no action required), as can any spell that ends a curse.": "如果Skabatha的画像被准时送到Bavlorna，巫婆就完成了她的交易。如果角色们未能在约定的时间内将Skabatha的画像送达，每个同意交易的角色必须在DC19魅力救赎中成功，否则将被诅咒。当被诅咒时，该角色将失去一件珍爱的物品（由你选择）。这个财物会消失，直到诅咒结束才会恢复。Bavlorna可以结束对一个角色的诅咒（不需要行动），正如任何可以结束诅咒的法术一样。",
	"If the characters were drawn to Prismeer by the \"Warlock's Quest\" adventure hook, they can strike a different bargain with Bavlorna, but she won't deal with anyone who claims to be searching for a way to help Zybilna and thereby weaken the Hourglass Coven. First and foremost, Bavlorna wants Skabatha's portrait (with the same time restrictions as the \"Lost Things\" bargain above) and is willing to trade for it. Once she has the portrait, her greed might focus on something else in Skabatha's possession, at your discretion.": "如果人物是被 \"术士的任务 \"的冒险钩子吸引到Prismeer的，他们可以与Bavlorna达成不同的交易，但她不会与任何声称在寻找帮助Zybilna从而削弱沙漏女巫的方法的人交易。首先，也是最重要的，巴弗洛娜想要斯卡巴塔的画像（时间限制与上述 \"丢失的东西 \"的交易相同），并愿意用它来交换。一旦她得到了画像，她的贪婪可能会集中在斯卡巴塔拥有的其他东西上，由你决定。",
	"If Bavlorna feels threatened, or if a fight turns against her, she flees to Thither on her {@item bobbing lily pad|WBtW} (in {@area area B1|1a6|x}) and reluctantly takes refuge with her older sister, Skabatha (see {@adventure chapter 3|WBtW|3} for details).": "如果巴弗洛尔娜感到受到威胁，或者一场战斗对她不利，她就会骑着她的{@item bobbing lily pad|WBtW}(在{@area area B1|1a6|x})逃到Thither，并不情愿地与她的姐姐Skabatha一起避难（详见{@adventure chapter 3|WBtW|3}）。",

This glamor is the work of a unicorn named Lamorna, who has claimed Wayward Pool as her domain. To reach the shore, one must be a unicorn or adopt the guise of one. The Getaway Gang has a unicorn costume that can accommodate two characters; other characters can satisfy the pool's protective ward by attaching fake unicorn horns to their heads. False horns can easily be hewn from wood or created using a {@spell silent image} spell or similar magic.": "那些试图接近池岸线1000英尺以内的人发现，他们穿过森林的任何路径都会把他们带回到他们开始的地方，而飞行生物发现自己无意中偏离了方向。这种魅力是一个叫拉莫娜的独角兽所为，她把向往的池子当作自己的领地。要到达岸边，必须是独角兽，或者采用独角兽的伪装。逍遥帮有一套可以容纳两个角色的独角兽服装；其他角色可以通过在头上安装假的独角兽角来满足水池的保护。假角可以很容易地从木头上凿出来，或者用{@spell silent image}的咒语或类似的魔法来制造。",

See \"{@area Zarak Attacks!|21d|x}\" below for more information.": "巫师{@creature Kelek|WBtW}，恶灵联盟的创始人（见{@area appendix B|46b|x}），已经命令刺客{@creature Zarak|WBtW}追捕拉莫娜并砍掉她的角。{@creature Zarak|WBtW}潜伏在水池外围的森林中，试图找到一条通往岸边的路。(他不知道 \"看起来像独角兽 \"的要求。)被动智慧({@skill Perception})得分高于15分的角色会感觉到他们被监视着。更多信息见下面的\"{@area Zarak Attacks!|21d|x}\"。",

	"On Lamorna's first turn after the surprise round, she teleports away, denying {@creature Zarak|WBtW} his prize and leaving him to face the characters alone. At this point, {@creature Zarak|WBtW} is disgusted with himself for not felling the unicorn immediately (\"I didn't know unicorns could do that,\" he mutters as Lamorna teleports away), but he's smart enough not to antagonize the characters any more than he already has. If the characters aren't spoiling for a fight, {@creature Zarak|WBtW} is satisfied to stand down and retreat back into the forest.": "在Lamorna惊喜回合后的第一个回合，她传送走了，拒绝了{@creature Zarak|WBtW}的奖品，让他独自面对那些角色。此时，{@creature Zarak|WBtW}对自己没有立即杀死独角兽感到厌恶（\"我不知道独角兽能做到这一点，\"他在拉莫娜传送走时喃喃自语），但他很聪明，没有再与角色们对立。如果角色们没有破坏战斗，{@creature Zarak|WBtW}就会满意地站下来，退回到森林里。",
	"{@creature Zarak|WBtW} is willing to give up his hunt in exchange for gold or if the characters seem likely to kill him.
