	"North of the Spine of the World and west of the towering Reghed Glacier is a frigid expanse few dare to explore, let alone inhabit. This icy land of windswept tundra recently became locked in a perpetual, dark winter without reprieve. Auril the Frostmaiden, the divine embodiment of winter's fury, has withdrawn to this cold corner of the world to live among mortals. Further, she has cast a terrible spell over Icewind Dale, to the detriment of most of its denizens.": "世界之脊以北，高耸的雷格德冰川以西是一片寒冷的土地，很少有人敢于探索，更不用说居住了。这片被风吹动的苔原的冰雪之地最近被锁在一个永久的、没有缓和的黑暗冬天。寒霜少女奥里尔，冬天愤怒的神圣化身，已经撤回到世界的这个寒冷角落，生活在凡人之中。此外，她还对冰风谷下了一个可怕的咒语，对其大多数居民造成了伤害。",
	"Each night before midnight, Auril takes to the sky on the back of a white roc and weaves her spell, which manifests as a shimmering curtain of light—a beautiful aurora that illuminates the night sky and fades before dawn. This powerful magic prevents the next day's sun from rising above the horizon, turning midday into twilight and trapping Icewind Dale in winter's dark embrace, with no sunlight or warmth to melt the snow and ice. Each casting of the spell leaves the Frostmaiden weakened, with just enough divine power left to barricade the mountain pass with blizzards and churn the Sea of Moving Ice with blistering winds. Such measures discourage travelers from approaching or leaving Icewind Dale, further isolating the region. Icewind Dale has thus been trapped in a different reality from the rest of the world, for though the sun never rises over the dale, it continues to rise everywhere else.": "每晚午夜前，欧瑞尔骑着白鹏鸟飞上天空，编织她的咒语，表现为一道闪亮的光幕--美丽的极光，照亮夜空，在黎明前消逝。这个强大的魔法阻止了第二天的太阳从地平线上升起，将正午变成了黄昏，将冰风谷困在冬天的黑暗怀抱中，没有阳光和温暖来融化冰雪。每一次施法都会使冰封女巫变得虚弱，只剩下足够的神力用暴风雪封锁山口，用刺骨的寒风搅动移动的冰海。这些措施阻止了旅行者接近或离开冰风谷，进一步孤立了这个地区。冰风谷因此被困于与世界其他地方不同的现实中，因为尽管太阳从未在谷地上空升起，但在其他地方却继续升起。",
	"The people of Icewind Dale know Auril's wrath when they feel it, and they have a name for the unending winter she has inflicted on them. They call it the Everlasting Rime. No one understands why the Frostmaiden has imposed her will in this way or why the other gods refuse to challenge her. This prolonged winter, which has gone on for more than two years, threatens to doom not just the flickering lights of civilization known as Ten-Towns but also the indigenous flora and fauna that need sunlight and the change of seasons to survive.": "冰风谷的人们在感受到欧瑞尔的愤怒时就知道了，他们对她施加给他们的无休止的冬天有一个名字。他们称其为 \"永恒的风铃\"。没有人理解为什么冰霜女巫以这种方式强加她的意志，也没有人理解为什么其他神灵拒绝挑战她。这个漫长的冬天已经持续了两年多，它不仅威胁着被称为 \"十镇 \"的闪烁的文明之光，也威胁着需要阳光和季节变化来生存的本地动植物。",
	"Not all creatures are discouraged by what has transpired north of the Spine of the World. The long nights and sunless days are a blessing to {@creature Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF}, a duergar who longs to carve out a domain for himself on the surface and enslave the people of Ten-Towns in the process. Already, he has taken advantage of Auril's magic and raised a fortress amid the dark shadows of the mountains. From here, his underlings strike out across the tundra in search of chardalyn—a crystalline substance known to exist only in Icewind Dale. Once he gathers enough of it, Xardorok plans to construct a chardalyn dragon and unleash it upon Ten-Towns.": "并非所有的生物都对世界之脊以北发生的事情感到气馁。漫长的夜晚和没有阳光的白天对{@creature Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF}来说是一种祝福，他渴望在地面上为自己开辟一块领地，并在此过程中奴役十镇的人民。他已经利用了奥里尔的魔法，在山脉的黑暗阴影中建立了一个堡垒。从这里，他的手下在苔原上寻找Chardalyn--一种只存在于冰风谷的晶体物质。一旦他收集到足够的物质，Xardorok计划建造一条chardalyn龙，并将其释放到十镇。",
	"Despite Auril's blizzards and other deterrents, visitors still come and go. Among the recent arrivals are four wizards of the Arcane Brotherhood, a powerful society of spellcasters based in Luskan. They've come chasing rumors of a lost city buried under the Reghed Glacier—a fragment of the long-gone Empire of Netheril, whose wizards wielded magic that terrified the gods. Netherese magic has a way of attracting power-hungry wizards, as members of the Arcane Brotherhood often are. The cities of Netheril floated among the clouds, making them almost impervious to assault for centuries. Then, nearly two thousand years ago, this floating city crashed during the fall of the empire, and no one has found or explored it since. It is, arguably, Icewind Dale's greatest secret—a necropolis of Netherese wizards and the magic they left behind. What survived the crash is anyone's guess, but we're about to find out!": "尽管有奥里尔的暴风雪和其他阻挠因素，游客仍然来来往往。在最近到来的人中，有四位来自奥术兄弟会的巫师，这是一个位于卢斯坎的强大的施法者协会。他们是来追寻埋藏在雷格德冰川下的失落之城的传闻--一个早已消失的尼瑟尔帝国的碎片，其巫师们挥舞着令诸神恐惧的魔法。尼瑟尔的魔法有一种吸引渴望权力的巫师的方式，就像奥术兄弟会的成员常常是这样。尼瑟尔的城市漂浮在云层之间，使它们在几个世纪里几乎不受攻击。然后，近两千年前，这座漂浮的城市在帝国的衰落中坠落，此后没有人发现或探索过它。可以说，它是冰风谷最大的秘密--尼瑟斯巫师的墓地和他们留下的魔法。谁也不知道坠机后有什么幸存下来，但我们马上就会知道了!",

	"The Reghed nomads who stalk the tundra and the Ten-Towners who keep civilization alive are so concerned with day-to-day survival that they typically pay little heed to the evil forces gathering on the fringes of Icewind Dale. Adventurers are much better equipped to deal with such threats, particularly in the dead of winter.": "在苔原上游荡的雷格德（Reghed）游牧民族和维持文明的天主（Ten-Towners）都非常关心日常的生存问题，他们通常很少注意到聚集在冰风谷边缘的邪恶力量。冒险者们更有能力应对这种威胁，尤其是在严冬。",
	"One recent arrival in the area is {@creature Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF}, a duergar warlock formerly of the Underdark. His patron, Deep Duerra, has urged Xardorok to fulfill his destiny and become the first duergar to rule a kingdom on the surface. Icewind Dale is cold, dark, and heartlessly cruel—the perfect realm for Xardorok to claim as despot. Unbeknownst to Xardorok, however, it is not Deep Duerra guiding his actions but the archdevil Asmodeus in the guise of Deep Duerra. In Xardorok, the Lord of the Nine Hells has found an eager and petty tyrant.": "最近来到这个地区的是{@creature Xardorok Sunblight|IDRotF}，一个以前在暗黑世界的duergar术士。他的赞助人，深渊杜拉（Deep Duerra），敦促Xardorok完成他的命运，成为第一个统治地面王国的duergar。冰风谷冰冷、黑暗、无情、残酷--是Xardorok成为暴君的完美境界。然而，Xardorok不知道的是，指导他行动的不是Deep Duerra，而是化身为Deep Duerra的大恶魔Asmodeus。在Xardorok身上，九层地狱的主宰找到了一个急切而小气的暴君。",
	"To achieve his goal, Xardorok is scouring the land for chardalyn, which he is forging into a dragon that he will send to destroy Ten-Towns. His sons, Durth and Nildar, lead teams of duergar on quests to retrieve more of this dark-colored crystal for their grasping, despotic father.": "为了实现他的目标，Xardorok正在搜罗土地上的chardalyn，他要把它锻造成一条龙，然后派它去摧毁十镇。他的儿子Durth和Nildar带领着duergar团队进行任务，为他们贪婪、专制的父亲夺回更多这种深色的水晶。",
	"The wizards of bygone Netheril wielded magic that could reshape the world. They used such magic to raise their cities into the sky. The city of Ythryn was one such wonder. It crashed long ago but still exists, buried under the Reghed Glacier on the eastern edge of Icewind Dale.": "昔日尼德兰的巫师们掌握着可以重塑世界的魔法。他们用这样的魔法将他们的城市升入天空。Ythryn城就是这样一个奇迹。它在很久以前就崩溃了，但仍然存在，被埋在冰风谷东部边缘的雷格德冰川之下。",
	"This frozen necropolis holds the remnants of some of the most powerful spellcasters in the history of the Realms, including a Netherese demilich. It also contains a {@i mythallar} (described in {@adventure appendix D|IDRotF|22}), a magic item that can raise an entire city into the air and alter the weather in a fifty-mile radius. The characters can use this device to counteract Auril's spell and free Icewind Dale from her Everlasting Rime.": "这个冰冻的尸骨城保存着一些王国历史上最强大的法术师的残骸，包括一个尼瑟尔人的恶魔。它还包含一个{@i mythallar}（在{@adventure appendix D|IDRotF|22}中描述），一个可以将整个城市升到空中并改变50英里范围内天气的魔法物品。角色们可以用这个装置来对抗奥里尔的咒语，并将冰风谷从她的恒定时间中解放出来。",
	"More than a hundred years prior to this adventure, a wizard named Akar Kessel found an artifact suffused with demonic magic called {@i Crenshinibon} (better known as the {@i Crystal Shard}) and used it to erect a great black tower in Icewind Dale. When this tower was destroyed, the magic used to create it fused with the surrounding ice to form what is now known as chardalyn: a nonmagical, crystalline substance as strong as metal, though considerably easier to work with than steel. In the years since, more deposits of chardalyn have been found across Icewind Dale. Like the {@i Crystal Shard}, these deposits tend to be suffused with demonic magic. Prolonged contact with chardalyn that has become suffused with demonic magic can warp a creature's mind, causing madness that usually fades away once the contact is broken.": "在这次冒险的一百多年前，一个名叫阿卡-凯瑟的巫师发现了一件充满恶魔魔法的工艺品，叫做{@i Crenshinibon}(更多的是称为{@i Crystal Shard})，并用它在冰风谷建立了一座巨大的黑塔。当这座塔被摧毁时，用来创造它的魔法与周围的冰融合在一起，形成了现在已知的Chardalyn：一种非魔法的晶体物质，与金属一样坚固，但比钢铁更容易操作。在此后的几年里，冰风谷各地发现了更多的chardalyn矿藏。与(2%)一样，这些矿床往往充满了恶魔的魔力。长时间接触充斥着恶魔魔力的chardalyn，可以扭曲生物的心智，导致疯狂，一旦接触中断，这种疯狂通常就会消失。",
	"Chardalyn is cold to the touch and readily accepts magical enchantment, making it an ideal substance for wands, staffs, and other magic items. A chardalyn object suffused with the magic of the Upper Planes is considered a consecrated object, while a chardalyn object suffused with the magic of the Lower Planes is considered a desecrated object; both can be identified as such using a {@spell detect evil and good} spell or similar magic.": "Chardalyn触摸起来很冷，而且很容易接受魔法，因此它是制作魔杖、法杖和其他魔法物品的理想物质。充斥着上层世界魔法的chardalyn物品被认为是被献祭的物品，而充斥着下层世界魔法的chardalyn物品被认为是被亵渎的物品；两者都可以通过{@spell detect evil and good}的咒语或类似的魔法来识别。",
	"Long before Akar Kessel left his mark on Icewind Dale, Netherese wizards created their own chardalyn. Many items made from this dark-colored crystal can be found in the ruins of ancient Netherese enclaves.": "早在阿卡-凯瑟尔在冰风谷留下他的印记之前，尼德兰的巫师们就创造了他们自己的Chardalyn。在古代尼瑟斯人的废墟中可以找到许多由这种深色水晶制成的物品。",
	"Four members of the Arcane Brotherhood (a cabal of wizards who act like Wild West gunslingers) have come to Icewind Dale in search of the lost Netherese enclave, hoping to unearth its secrets. Whether the characters choose to aid or oppose these wizards is up to them, but one thing is certain: the Arcane Brotherhood won't let a band of adventurers stand between them and the magic that waits to be found in the doomed, sepulchral ruin.": "奥术兄弟会（Arcane Brotherhood）（一个由巫师组成的阴谋集团，他们的行为就像西部的枪手）的四名成员来到冰风谷，寻找失落的尼瑟斯飞地，希望能发掘出它的秘密。角色们是选择帮助还是反对这些巫师，由他们自己决定，但有一点是肯定的：奥术兄弟会不会让一帮冒险者挡在他们和等待在这个注定灭亡的废墟中发现的魔法之间。",
	"Auril's decision to live among mortals is explained in {@book appendix C|idrotf|21}. What the characters discover in the course of the adventure is that she's unhappy and craves isolation. Her nightly quest to hold the sun at bay stems from a need to preserve the beauty of things by freezing them. There is no way to reason with a being so bereft of compassion as Auril, but in her weakened state, she can be defeated or forced to reckon with her cruel indifference toward life.": "Auril决定生活在凡人之中的原因是（%0%）。人物在冒险过程中发现，她不快乐，渴望与世隔绝。她每夜都在追求把太阳挡在门外，这是因为她需要通过冻结事物来保存它们的美丽。没有办法与像奥里尔这样缺乏同情心的生物讲道理，但在她虚弱的状态下，她可以被打败或被迫考虑她对生命的残酷漠视。",
	"Anyone who hopes to reach the Netherese city buried in the ice must first visit Auril's island and obtain {@item The Codicil of White|IDRotF}, a book compiled by the Frostmaiden's most ardent followers.

Anyone who clears out the mine can expect to be well compensated.": "在Termalaine，Masthew议长关闭了该镇一个有利可图的宝石矿。显然，一伙哥布林悄悄地进入了矿场，并威胁到了一些矿工。任何清理出该矿的人都会得到丰厚的补偿。",

	"Once the characters reach 4th level, they no long gain levels by completing the quests in this chapter.

	"As the characters complete the quests in this chapter, their reputation in Ten-Towns begins to spread.

Fame in Icewind Dale is always a double-edged sword.": "随着人物完成本章的任务，他们在十镇的名声开始传播。无论好坏，他们都会被十镇的人们所熟知--有些人把他们当作救世主，有些人则害怕他们的胆量，羡慕他们的力量，或者觊觎他们积累的财富。在冰风谷的名声总是一把双刃剑。",

	"When the characters reach 3rd level, they begin to earn a healthy measure of respect from Ten-Towners who know of their exploits.": "当人物达到3级时，他们开始从知道他们的事迹的天镇人那里赢得健康的尊重。",
	"When the characters reach 4th level, they are given a hero's welcome in the towns they've helped but are given the cold shoulder in towns they've ignored. They also learn about new adventure opportunities outside Ten-Towns, as described in {@adventure chapter 2|IDRotF|12}.": "当角色达到4级时，他们在他们帮助过的城镇中受到英雄的欢迎，但在他们忽视的城镇中却受到冷遇。他们也会了解到十镇以外的新的冒险机会，如{@adventure chapter 2|IDRotF|12}中所述。",
	"Ten-Towns didn't spring up overnight. It started from humble beginnings four centuries ago. Immigrants from all over Faerûn came here in search of escape or adventure and built a modest trade post atop the hill where Bryn Shander now stands. One by one, settlements sprung up on the shores of Maer Dualdon, Lac Dinneshere, and Redwaters. The ever-present threat of orcs and other monsters compelled the poorly defended lakeside towns to turn Bryn Shander from a modest hilltop trading post into a walled town capable of defending all Ten-Towners if and when the worst comes.": "腾博会官网诚信为本并不是一夜之间崛起的。它是在四个世纪前从卑微的起点开始的。来自法鲁恩各地的移民来到这里寻找逃生或冒险，并在现在布林山德所在的山顶上建立了一个简陋的贸易站。一个接一个的定居点在Maer Dualdon、Lac Dinneshere和Redwaters的海岸上兴起。兽人和其他怪物无处不在的威胁迫使这些防卫薄弱的湖边小镇将布林山德从一个简陋的山顶贸易站变成了一个有围墙的小镇，在最坏的情况发生时，能够保卫所有的Ten-Towners。",
	"Most of the towns contain trace evidence of the immigrant cultures that birthed them. This evidence is carved into houses, statues, and other fixtures. For example, the dinosaur carvings on the older buildings of Good Mead remind folk that many of its original settlers were Chultan.": "大多数城镇都有孕育它们的移民文化的痕迹。这些证据被刻在房屋、雕像和其他装置上。例如，古德米德的老建筑上的恐龙雕刻提醒人们，其最初的定居者中有许多是楚丹人。",
	"Residents of Ten-Towns tend to remain indoors when they're not working, since it's so frightfully cold outside, which gives each settlement a deathly quiet aspect. Most people who venture outdoors are bundled up in so much cold weather clothing as to be barely recognizable, and they don't stand around long enough for the cold wind to get the better of them.": "十镇的居民在不工作的时候倾向于留在室内，因为外面冷得吓人，这使每个定居点都有一种死一般的安静。大多数冒险到户外的人都被捆绑在寒冷的天气里，几乎无法辨认，而且他们不会站在那里太久，因为寒风会让他们更难受。",
	"Auril's winter spell has caused the population of Ten-Towns to dwindle and has heightened rivalries that have simmered for years, turning neighboring towns against one another as competition for resources becomes increasingly intense. The alliance of Ten-Towns won't hold if the mounting tribalism continues to threaten the common good.": "奥里尔的冬季魔咒导致十镇的人口减少，并加剧了酝酿多年的竞争，随着对资源的竞争变得越来越激烈，邻近的城镇也开始相互对抗。如果日益严重的部落主义继续威胁到共同利益，十镇联盟将无法维持。",
	"Most of the ten towns except Bryn Shander are built on the shores of three big lakes. The largest population of knucklehead trout is in Maer Dualdon, the deepest of the lakes. Redwaters, the shallowest lake, almost completely freezes in winter, making the fishing there difficult. Lac Dinneshere catches the worst of the winds blowing off the Reghed Glacier to the east and thus has the roughest waters. Small thermal vents at the bottom of these lakes keep them from freezing completely, even in the coldest winters.": "除布林山德外，这十个城镇中的大多数都建在三个大湖的岸边。最深的湖泊Maer Dualdon是最大的节头鳟鱼种群。最浅的湖泊--红水湖（Redwaters）在冬季几乎完全结冰，使得那里的捕鱼变得困难。Dinneshere湖赶上了东面Reghed冰川吹来的最坏的风，因此拥有最汹涌的水域。这些湖泊底部的小型热力喷口使它们即使在最冷的冬天也不会完全冻结。",
	"Ten-Towns fishing boats are simple affairs. The smallest are rowboats and single-masted skiffs that require careful handling to avoid capsizing. Larger, twin-masted cogs and keelboats with single decks handle the wind and waves better. These ships fly the flags of their towns and provide fish for the whole community, not for any individual fisher.": "Ten-Towns渔船是简单的事务。最小的是划艇和单桅小船，需要小心操作以避免翻船。较大的双桅小船和单层甲板的龙骨船能更好地处理风和浪。这些船挂着他们城镇的旗帜，为整个社区提供鱼，而不是为任何个别渔民。",
	"When thick ice covers the lakes, many fishers stay to the shelters of their homes and hearths, but the most dedicated or desperate cut holes in the ice and dangle their lines down in hopes of tempting hungry trout.": "当厚厚的冰层覆盖在湖面上时，许多渔民呆在家里和炉灶的庇护所里，但最热心或最绝望的人在冰上凿洞，把鱼线垂下来，希望能引诱饥饿的鳟鱼。",
	"The folk of Ten-Towns don't have a lot of options when it comes to keeping warm. People from Good Mead, Lonelywood, and Termalaine burn wood salvaged from nearby forests to heat their houses. In the other towns of Icewind Dale, wood is too precious a commodity to burn, so whale oil is used in lamps and small stoves around which townsfolk huddle for warmth.": "在取暖方面，十镇的居民没有太多的选择。来自Good Mead、Lonelywood和Termalaine的人们燃烧着从附近森林打捞上来的木材来取暖。在冰风谷的其他城镇，木材太过珍贵而无法燃烧，所以鲸鱼油被用在灯和小炉子上，镇民们挤在一起取暖。",
	"Ten-Towners buy their whale oil from whalers who live on the shores of the Sea of Moving Ice. Whaling is thus a lucrative (if inherently dangerous) business in Icewind Dale.": "Ten-Towners从居住在移动冰海海岸的捕鲸者那里购买鲸鱼油。因此，在冰风谷，捕鲸是一项有利可图的生意（尽管本身就很危险）。",
	"Any item listed in the equipment chapter of the {@book Player's Handbook|PHB} can be bought in Ten-Towns, including fishing tackle and sleds. The larger the town, the more likely it is to have the item.": "装备篇（%0%）中列出的任何物品都可以在十镇买到，包括钓具和雪橇。城镇越大，越有可能有该物品。",

	"Snowshoes reduce the likelihood of their wearer getting stuck in the deep snow.": "雪鞋减少了穿戴者陷入深雪中的可能性。",
	"Most Ten-Towners travel from town to town on foot. Those who need to transport more goods than they can carry use wooden sleds pulled by dogs or domesticated axe beaks as pack animals. Such things can be bought and sold in every Ten-Towns settlement.": "大多数天镇人从一个镇到另一个镇都是步行。那些需要运输更多货物的人则使用狗拉的木制雪橇或驯化的斧头嘴作为驮运动物。这种东西在每个天镇定居点都可以买到和卖到。",

	"The desperate people of Ten-Towns, hoping to appease Auril so that summer can return to Icewind Dale, make sacrifices to the Frostmaiden on nights of the new moon. This is a new practice that started a little over a year ago, when it became clear that Auril was angry and summer would not be returning anytime soon.

Ferocious blizzards make the mountain pass through the Spine of the World exceedingly treacherous, and this land has not felt the warmth of the sun in over two years. In fact, the sun no longer appears above the mountains, not even in what should be the height of summer. In this frozen tundra, darkness and bitter cold reign as king and queen.

She has a protection racket that earns her a little coin on the side, and she also commits murders for profit on the sly. One of the larger sacks on Torrga's sled contains the frozen corpse of a male half-elf in his thirties with a stab wound in his chest. The half-elf had a bounty on his head and came to Icewind Dale to disappear. Torrga found him and killed him with Sephek's help.

She employs {@creature Sephek Kaltro|IDRotF} as a bodyguard and pays four others (neutral evil human {@creature Bandit||bandits}) to drive and protect the other two sleds.

	"The best way to deal with Sephek is to confront him while he's separated from Torrga and her other cronies. Sephek stays close to Torrga during business hours. Once activity drops off, Torrga shuts down her operation for the rest of the day, puts the dogs in a kennel and the sleds in a secure shed, and pays for the team's lodgings. After Torrga retires for the night, Sephek is free to do as he pleases until the following morning. If he happens to be in Bryn Shander, Easthaven, or Targos, he stalks his next murder victim. If he's elsewhere, he spends the night drinking and carousing, then falls asleep for a few hours, preferably in an unheated place such as a barn or an abandoned cottage.": "对付Sephek的最好办法是在他与Torrga和她的其他亲信分开时与他对峙。塞菲克在营业时间内与托尔加保持密切联系。一旦活动减少，托尔加就会在一天之内关闭她的业务，把狗放在狗窝里，把雪橇放在一个安全的棚子里，并支付团队的住宿费。在托尔加退休过夜后，塞菲克可以自由地做他喜欢的事，直到第二天早上。如果他碰巧在布林山德、伊士文或塔戈斯，他就会跟踪他的下一个谋杀受害者。如果他在其他地方，他就会在晚上喝酒和狂欢，然后睡上几个小时，最好是在一个没有暖气的地方，比如谷仓或废弃的小屋。",
	"When asked about his odd style of dress, {@creature Sephek Kaltro|IDRotF} claims that he was born on the holiday of Midwinter and that the Frostmaiden's blessing protects him from the cold. In truth, Sephek was not born during Midwinter. He was a mariner whose ship sank off the coast of Auril's island a few months ago. He swam to the island but nearly froze to death. As his life was fading, the spirit of a frost druid beholden to Auril possessed him. The winter spirit cannibalized Sephek's spirit and is using him as a living vessel to do the Frostmaiden's work. The spirit can't leave Sephek's body; if Sephek dies, the winter spirit is destroyed along with him.": "当被问及他奇怪的着装风格时，{@creature Sephek Kaltro|IDRotF}声称他是在中秋节出生的，而且冰霜女巫的祝福能保护他免受寒冷。事实上，塞菲克并不是在仲冬节期间出生的。他是一个水手，几个月前他的船在奥里尔岛的海岸边沉没了。他游到岛上，但几乎被冻死了。当他的生命逐渐消逝时，一个听命于欧瑞尔的冰霜德鲁伊的灵魂附身于他。冬日之魂吞噬了塞菲克的灵魂，并将他作为一个活的容器来做冰霜女巫的工作。灵魂不能离开萨菲克的身体；如果萨菲克死了，冬天的灵魂也会随着他一起毁灭。",

As Hlin suspects, he has been killing Ten-Towners who pay off low-ranking town officials to exclude their names from the lotteries in Bryn Shander, Easthaven, and Targos. Because he's doing the Frostmaiden's work, the spirit inside Sephek doesn't care about getting caught, and he isn't shy about admitting his guilt. He considers surrendering only because it buys time for him to escape and commit more murders. In combat, he wields a magical sword and magical daggers made of ice that he can conjure at will.

	"After finding and slaying Sephek, the characters can return to Hlin and collect their 100 gp reward. If they don't have evidence to prove that Sephek is dead, Hlin is willing to take them at their word. If the ice-dagger murders stop, she'll know her trust was not misplaced.

For the characters' services, Dannika is offering the group 25 gp as well as a {@item Lantern of Tracking|IDRotF|lantern of tracking (elementals)} that can help locate chwingas. She says she'll be at the local tavern each evening, so the characters should have no trouble finding her once the job is completed. If the characters accept her quest, Dannika gives them her lantern (see {@adventure appendix D|IDRotF|22}) and explains how it works. She then tells them she's been looking all over town and hasn't found any chwingas. She suggests the characters might have better luck in one of the other settlements. She could continue the search herself, but she's nervous about venturing out into the extreme cold and has other research-related chores to attend to.": "演讲者是丹妮卡-格雷斯泰尔（合法中立的半精灵（%0%）），她是一位学者，认为被称为chwingas的微元素精神可能是改善冰风谷气候的关键。由于温格人居住在十镇，并且有一些改变自然环境的能力，丹妮卡认为通过近距离研究温格人，她可以学到很多。对于这些人物的服务，丹妮卡为他们提供了25戈比，以及一个可以帮助找到温格人的{@item Lantern of Tracking|IDRotF|lantern of tracking (elementals)}。她说她每天晚上都会在当地的小酒馆，所以一旦完成任务，人物应该不难找到她。如果人物接受了她的任务，丹妮卡会把她的灯笼给他们（见{@adventure appendix D|IDRotF|22}），并解释它的工作原理。然后她告诉他们，她已经找遍了整个镇子，但没有发现任何chwingas。她建议角色们在其他定居点可能会有更好的运气。她可以自己继续寻找，但她对冒险进入极度寒冷的环境感到紧张，而且还有其他与研究有关的琐事要做。",
	"There are no chwingas in the adventurers' starting town, but each time they visit another town in Icewind Dale, there's a cumulative {@chance 25|25 percent} chance of chwingas being present.

On a failed check, both bears are hostile toward that character for the rest of the encounter.

	"In generations past, travelers to Caer-Dineval had to follow the rocky shore of Lac Dinneshere until after several hours they spied a small fortress (the \"caer\" for which the town is named) jutting up from the prominence where it overlooks the lake. A ferry out of Easthaven made the arduous trek unnecessary for merchants and other travelers, but the ferry was discontinued two months ago, cutting off Caer-Dineval (and its eastward neighbor, Caer-Konig) from the rest of Ten-Towns except by the overland route.

	"This small castle was built over four hundred years ago by the Dinev family from Cormyr, before Ten-Towns existed as anything more than a few scattered camps of explorers living off the land. The Dinevs hoped to claim sovereignty over the unsettled lands of Icewind Dale. When the castle, dubbed Caer-Dineval, was completed, the workers and their families settled in the outbuildings they had constructed farther down the cliff, along with the families of the retainers the Dinevs had brought with them. Over the next few years, many explorers in the region came to see the Caer for themselves, and some built cottages in the shadow of its walls. No sooner had the small town taken hold than marauding orcs swept down from the tundra to put it to the torch. The town's residents tried to take refuge in the castle, but the Dinevs, alarmed by the size of the orc horde, barred the gates and refused to open them. The orcs fell upon the stranded people and slaughtered them to the last one. The Dinevs survived the initial assault, but not the siege that followed. After three weeks of being confined in the Caer, the Dinevs were so weakened by hunger that they were unable to resist when the orcs scaled the castle walls. Thus, the Dinev family's brief rule in Icewind Dale came to a bloody end.": "这座小城堡是四百多年前由来自科米尔的迪内夫家族建造的，当时十镇还没有任何东西，只是一些分散的探险者营地，靠土地为生。迪内夫家族希望对冰风谷这块未开发的土地拥有主权。当这座被称为Caer-Dineval的城堡完工后，工人们和他们的家人在悬崖下较远的地方建造的附属建筑中定居下来，同时还有Dinevs带来的家臣的家人。在接下来的几年里，该地区的许多探险家来到这里亲眼目睹了Caer，一些人在城墙的阴影下建造了小屋。小镇刚站稳脚跟，掠夺性的兽人就从苔原上冲下来，把它烧成灰烬。镇上的居民试图在城堡里避难，但迪涅夫人被兽人部落的规模所惊吓，封锁了大门并拒绝打开。兽人扑向受困的人们，将他们屠杀殆尽。迪内夫人在最初的攻击中幸存下来，但没有在随后的围攻中幸存。在被关在凯尔的三个星期后，迪内夫家族因饥饿而变得非常虚弱，当兽人翻越城堡的墙壁时，他们无法抵抗。因此，迪内夫家族在冰风谷的短暂统治就这样血腥地结束了。",
	"The Caer remained in the orcs' possession for several years, until they were driven out by a small army of human settlers from other parts of the dale who banded together. The victors claimed the castle and its lands, and those with families brought them here to settle. Their descendants live here to this day and keep alive the memory of their ancestors' deeds.": "卡伊尔在兽人手中停留了数年，直到他们被一支来自山谷其他地方的人类定居者组成的小规模军队赶走。胜利者宣称拥有这座城堡和它的土地，那些有家庭的人把他们带到这里定居。他们的后代至今生活在这里，并保持着对祖先事迹的记忆。",

Although he has spare rooms with empty beds, he claims to have no available guest accommodations. If adventurers are looking for a place to rest, he suggests that they try the Caer.

After they agreed to follow Levistus, a pale glow caught their eye in the snow nearby, leading to the discovery of a sword-shaped amulet of chardalyn. Each of these amulets has an inner radiance that provides warmth and aid, protecting its wearer against the cold while guiding them safely back to civilization. Once its wearer reaches Ten-Towns, the talisman loses its inner radiance, yet the cultists keep their amulets as signs of their devotion to the archduke of Stygia (see the \"Chardalyn Amulets\" sidebar).": "大多数邪教徒都是冰风谷的本地人，如果不是莱维斯托斯为他们出面干预，他们就会在荒野中灭亡。这些邪教徒的故事都是一样的：当他们快要冻死的时候，大恶魔在他们的脑海中向他们伸出了手，提供了第二次生命的机会，以换取他们的绝对奉献。在他们同意追随莱维斯特后，附近的雪地上有一道淡淡的光芒吸引了他们的目光，导致他们发现了一个剑形的查尔达林护身符。这些护身符中的每一个都有内在的光芒，提供温暖和帮助，保护佩戴者抵御寒冷，同时引导他们安全返回文明社会。一旦佩戴者到达十镇，护身符就会失去内在的光芒，但崇拜者会保留他们的护身符，作为他们对斯蒂吉亚大公的奉献的标志（见 \"Chardalyn护身符 \"侧边栏）。",
	"The Knights of the Black Sword have members scattered throughout Ten-Towns.

The cult's oldest living member, Hethyl (a peg-legged shield dwarf who has lost her right foot to frostbite), hates duergar as most dwarves do. She has convinced the other cult members to forge alliances with anyone willing to oppose the duergar, including stray bands of adventurers.": "莱维斯特已经警告黑剑骑士团，虫族正在策划破坏十镇。他相信这些精灵是代表地狱之主阿斯莫德（Asmodeus）和他的地狱狱卒行事的，但他并没有与邪教分享这一信息。该邪教最年长的成员赫特（一个因冻伤而失去右脚的钉腿盾牌矮人）像大多数矮人一样憎恨精灵。她说服其他邪教成员与任何愿意反对精灵族的人结成联盟，包括流浪的冒险者队伍。",
