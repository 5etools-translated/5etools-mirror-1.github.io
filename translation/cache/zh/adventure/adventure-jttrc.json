	"In the heart of the Ethereal Plane lies an ancient and mysterious city called the Radiant Citadel.

	"The adventures in {@i Journeys through the Radiant Citadel} were created by members of the Dungeons & Dragons community with connections to various real-world cultures and mythologies. Embarking on the adventures of the Radiant Citadel will expand your gaming horizons, can give your characters new perspectives, and might change the way you look at fantasy tropes and traditions. As adventures are the lens through which we explore fantastic worlds, they shape who our characters are and what they believe in. The greater the variety adventures offer, the richer our characters and, by extension, our gaming experiences.": "{@i Journeys through the Radiant Citadel}中的冒险是由龙与地下城社区的成员创造的，与各种现实世界的文化和神话有关。踏上《辐射堡垒》的冒险之旅，将拓展你的游戏视野，可以给你的角色带来新的视角，并可能改变你对奇幻故事和传统的看法。由于冒险是我们探索奇幻世界的透镜，它们塑造了我们的角色是谁以及他们相信什么。冒险提供的种类越多，我们的角色就越丰富，进而我们的游戏体验也就越丰富。",

The gates of the Radiant Citadel stand open, and a rich tapestry of stories is yours to explore.": "从闪亮的夜市到海底城市，从受诅咒影响的村庄到天使统治的城邦，这些冒险提供了一条通往从未见过的土地和故事的途径。辐射城堡的大门敞开着，丰富的故事织锦等着你去探索。",
	"The Journeys through the Radiant Citadel table summarizes the adventures in this anthology. Each adventure is designed for four to six characters of a particular level, but you can adjust it for larger or smaller groups as well as for characters of higher or lower level by making a few changes, like swapping one monster or trap for another, changing the number of foes in an encounter, or adjusting DCs to make important tasks easier or harder for the characters to accomplish.": "辐射堡垒之旅表总结了本文集中的冒险。每个冒险都是为四到六个特定级别的角色设计的，但你可以通过一些改变来调整它，以适应更大或更小的群体，以及更高或更低的角色，比如用一个怪物或陷阱换另一个，改变遭遇战中的敌人数量，或调整DC，使角色更容易或更难完成重要任务。",
	"Each adventure in this anthology is versatile, and characters might become involved in any of the following ways:": "本选集中的每一次冒险都是多变的，人物可能以下列任何一种方式参与进来。",
	"The characters have ties to the plot as detailed in the \"Character Hooks\" section in each adventure.": "这些人物与剧情有联系，详见每个冒险中的 \"人物钩子 \"部分。",
	"The characters have journeyed to the Radiant Citadel, and their connections to individuals or organizations there lead them to investigate the plot.": "这些人物已经来到了辐射城堡，他们与那里的个人或组织的联系导致他们调查这个情节。",
	"A character hails from the land where the adventure takes place and has a connection to the plot.": "一个角色来自冒险发生的地方，与剧情有关联。",
	"These short adventures work best with players who like exploring new lands and finding clever solutions to complex challenges. That said, each adventure contains opportunities for exploration, roleplaying, and combat to appeal to players of all persuasions.": "这些短小的冒险最适合那些喜欢探索新土地和寻找复杂挑战的巧妙解决方案的玩家。也就是说，每一次冒险都包含了探索、角色扮演和战斗的机会，可以吸引各种类型的玩家。",
	"To run these adventures, you need the fifth edition core rulebooks: {@book Player's Handbook|PHB}, {@book Dungeon Master's Guide|DMG}, and {@book Monster Manual|MM}.": "要运行这些冒险，你需要第五版的核心规则书：（%0%）、（%1%）和（%2%）。",

	"The {@book Monster Manual|MM} contains stat blocks for most of the creatures encountered in these adventures. When a creature's name appears in {@b bold} type, that's a visual cue pointing you to its stat block as a way of saying, \"Hey, DM, get this creature's stat block ready. You'll need it.\" If a stat block is new, the adventure's text tells you where to find it.": "{@book Monster Manual|MM}包含这些冒险中遇到的大多数生物的状态块。当一个生物的名字以{@b bold}类型出现时，那是一个视觉提示，指向你的状态块，是在说：\"嘿，管理员，把这个生物的状态块准备好。你会需要它的。\" 如果一个状态块是新的，冒险的文本会告诉你在哪里找到它。",

	"Each adventure in this book introduces a new location—be it a city, a nation, a region, or otherwise. Before running an adventure, review the gazetteer presented at the adventure's end. Aside from providing an overview of the people and plots in that land, each gazetteer provides cultural details useful in describing the setting and making it feel vibrant.": "本书中的每一次冒险都介绍了一个新的地点--无论是城市、国家、地区，还是其他。在进行冒险之前，请查看冒险结束时提供的地名索引。除了提供该地人民和地块的概况外，每个地名词典都提供了文化细节，有助于描述环境并使其感到充满活力。",
	"The locations in this book can be incorporated into any D&D setting or a world of your own design. Each adventure includes a \"Setting the Adventure\" section that suggests where you might place the adventure. Weave these locations into your version of your favorite world, adding them where you like—even replacing other lands on your world map. Alternatively, use the {@adventure Radiant Citadel|JttRC|1} or planes-spanning magic to place these locations in entirely new worlds, and use them as the thresholds of realms defined how you please.": "本书中的地点可以纳入任何D&D背景或你自己设计的世界中。每个冒险都包括一个 \"设置冒险 \"部分，建议你将冒险放在哪里。将这些地点编入你喜欢的世界版本中，在你喜欢的地方添加它们--甚至取代你世界地图上的其他土地。或者，使用{@adventure Radiant Citadel|JttRC|1}或跨越星球的魔法将这些地点放置在全新的世界中，并将它们作为境界的门槛，随心所欲地定义。",

	"Describe everyone's features, not just those whose features are different from your own.": "描述每个人的特征，而不是只描述那些与你的特征不同的人。",
	"When describing a character's appearance, strive to detail more than just one thing and avoid descriptions based on stereotypes. The more you can say about body type, hair style and texture, skin tone, clothes, accessories, and the like, the more dimension a character has. As some societies strongly associate ethnicity with skin color, take extra care when describing characters' skin colors. Consider a range of literal descriptions, such as copper, umber, onyx, or ebony, with modifiers such as rich, lustrous, warm, or cool.": "在描述人物的外貌时，要努力详细描述，而不是只描述一件事，避免基于刻板印象的描述。你对体型、发型和质地、肤色、衣服、配饰等的描述越多，人物的形象就越立体。由于一些社会将种族与肤色紧密联系在一起，在描述人物的肤色时要格外小心。可以考虑一系列的字面描述，如铜色、乌木色、玛瑙色或乌木色，以及丰富、有光泽、温暖或凉爽等修饰语。",
	"You don't have to reveal a setting's entire culture at once. Skip details that aren't immediately relevant to characters, and reveal details as they arise. A scene in a tavern presents opportunities to introduce distinct foods, while a market trip is a great time to note varieties of dress.": "你不必一下子揭示一个环境的全部文化。跳过那些与人物没有直接关系的细节，在他们出现时揭示细节。酒馆里的场景为介绍独特的食物提供了机会，而市场旅行则是注意服装品种的好时机。",
	"Highlight what's familiar in a culture and how it's like other locations. This can help characters ground their experiences and better understand where they're visiting.": "突出一个文化中熟悉的东西，以及它与其他地方的区别。这可以帮助人物建立起他们的经验，更好地理解他们所访问的地方。",
	"Just as you don't have to breathe fire in real life to play a dragonborn in D&D, you don't need to be from the cultures that inspired the adventures in this book to play characters from them. However, take care to portray characters as three-dimensional people with relatable desires and fears.": "正如你不需要在现实生活中喷火来扮演D&D中的龙裔一样，你也不需要来自启发本书中冒险的文化来扮演其中的角色。但是，要注意把人物描绘成具有亲和力的欲望和恐惧的三维人。",
	"One person's culture isn't another's costume. If you dress up, simple outfits are best. Avoid leaning into stereotypes or clothing with real-world religious significance. Instead, focus on \"everyday wear\" from the cultures you're exploring. Don't change your skin color, alter your features, or emulate hair styles you wouldn't normally have to appear like a different real-world ethnicity. Similarly, avoid mocking real-world accents in your roleplay.": "一个人的文化并不是另一个人的服装。如果你穿上衣服，最好是简单的服装。避免倾向于刻板印象或具有现实世界宗教意义的服装。相反，专注于你正在探索的文化中的 \"日常服装\"。不要改变你的肤色，改变你的特征，或模仿你通常不会有的发型，以显得像一个不同的现实世界的民族。同样，在你的角色扮演中，避免嘲弄现实世界的口音。",
	"Against the unending mist and unseen terrors of the Ethereal Plane, the Radiant Citadel stands bright as a bastion of hope. It's a living relic of the ingenuity and collaboration of twenty-seven great civilizations. Abandoned and lost for ages, the Citadel was resurrected from its slumber and reclaimed by descendants of those societies, though some peoples remain missing. The city serves as a nexus of diplomacy and trade, a repository of histories and secrets, and a thriving sanctuary for those seeking safety or a better life.": "在虚空界无尽的迷雾和看不见的恐怖中，辐射城堡作为希望的堡垒而屹立不倒。它是27个伟大文明的聪明才智和合作的活的遗迹。被遗弃和迷失了很久的城堡从沉睡中复活，并被这些社会的后裔所夺回，尽管有些人仍然失踪。这座城市是外交和贸易的枢纽，是历史和秘密的宝库，也是那些寻求安全或更好生活的人的繁荣的避难所。",
	"The Radiant Citadel is a miracle of architecture, a floating city carved out of a single, massive fossil that snakes around a colossal gemstone shard known as the Auroral Diamond. The luminescence of the Auroral Diamond is mirrored in the constellation of fifteen structure-sized gemstones, the Concord Jewels, which orbit the city and provide transportation to the far-flung homes of the Citadel's founding civilizations. In the haze of the Ethereal Plane, the Auroral Diamond is a scintillating beacon visible from leagues away. The diamond itself seems to have moods, changing colors unpredictably, but it is always visible for wanderers lost and in need. Just beyond the city whirls a massive, ever-threatening, ethereal cyclone known as the Keening Gloom—a looming threat that's a grim reminder of the Citadel's precarious position.": "辐射堡垒是一个建筑奇迹，是一个由一块巨大的化石雕刻而成的浮动城市，该化石围绕着一个被称为极光之钻的巨大宝石碎片蜿蜒而行。极光之钻的光芒反映在由15个结构大小的宝石组成的星座上，即协和宝石，它们围绕着城市运行，为城堡的创始文明提供通往遥远家园的交通。在空灵界的阴霾中，极光钻石是一座闪烁的灯塔，从数里之外都能看到。这颗钻石本身似乎也有情绪，颜色变化无常，但对于迷路和需要帮助的流浪者来说，它总是可见的。就在城市之外，有一个巨大的、不断威胁的、被称为 \"振奋的阴霾 \"的空灵气旋在旋转，这是一个迫在眉睫的威胁，提醒着学城不稳定的地位。",
	"Heroes and paupers meet on equal footing in the Radiant Citadel. By common agreement, power and resources are equitably shared. Dignity is afforded to all, and great need is met with great aid.": "英雄和贫民在辐射堡垒中平等相遇。通过共同的协议，权力和资源被公平地分享。所有的人都享有尊严，巨大的需求得到了巨大的援助。",
	"Those familiar with the Radiant Citadel know the following details:": "熟悉辐射堡垒的人知道以下细节。",
	"The Radiant Citadel is an extraplanar refuge known for its collaborative society and ecological beauty. Local traditions of oral storytelling preserve ancestral wisdom from many worlds.": "辐射城堡是一个星外避难所，以其合作社会和生态之美而闻名。当地口述故事的传统保存了来自许多世界的祖先智慧。",
	"The majority of the Radiant Citadel's populace comes from the civilizations that govern the city. This makes the population an ethnically diverse mix of humans, dragonborn, dwarves, elves, gnomes, and halflings, along with a variety of other races.": "辐射堡垒的大部分人口来自管辖该城市的文明。这使得人口在种族上具有多样性，包括人类、龙裔、矮人、精灵、地精和半身人，以及其他各种种族。",
	"Common is widely known, along with dozens of other languages.": "普通话是广为人知的，还有其他几十种语言。",
	"The Radiant Citadel is a testament to a lost age of extraordinary magic and mythical beasts. The city rises from a gargantuan fossil, and every road and building has been carved from it. The Citadel is a place of beauty and wonder, with a vast array of vegetation and a multitude of sites and inhabitants.": "辐射堡垒是一个失落的时代的证明，它拥有非凡的魔法和神话般的野兽。这座城市从一块巨大的化石中升起，每条道路和建筑都是由它雕刻而成。城堡是一个美丽而神奇的地方，有大量的植被和众多的遗址和居民。",
	"The Auroral Diamond is the heart of the Radiant Citadel. A massive gemstone of unfathomable power, its life-giving magic runs through the entire city; the city's vegetation, water, light, and unique artifices depend on the Diamond.": "极光钻石是辐射城的心脏。一块巨大的宝石具有深不可测的力量，它赋予生命的魔力贯穿整个城市；城市的植被、水、光和独特的人工制品都依赖于这颗钻石。",
	"The Auroral Diamond changes color for unknown reasons. Sometimes it holds a color for an entire year, while other times it shifts twice in a single week. Rarely does it ever repeat a color. Some scholars believe each color represents the birth of a new civilization somewhere in the multiverse, and repetition of a color means the death of that civilization. Other scholars hypothesize the changing colors are a countdown to some unknown event.": "极光钻石的颜色变化原因不明。有时，它的颜色会保持一整年，而其他时候，它在一个星期内会有两次变化。它很少重复一种颜色。一些学者认为，每种颜色都代表着多元宇宙中某处新文明的诞生，而重复一种颜色则意味着该文明的死亡。其他学者则假设，颜色的变化是对某些未知事件的倒计时。",
	"The Auroral Diamond is indestructible. Whatever magic hollowed out the gemstone's center and created the {@area Preserve of the Ancestors|015|x} (described later) is unknown.": "极光钻石是不可摧毁的。不管是什么魔法掏空了宝石的中心，并创造了{@area Preserve of the Ancestors|015|x}（后面描述），都是未知的。",
	"The denizens of the Court of Whispers barter for current knowledge. Heralds, criers, bards, and griots buy and sell information from the fifteen founding civilizations active in the Citadel, as well as other lands. Skilled scouts and spies can also be hired for short-term reconnaissance or long-term infiltration. The Court is a mixed outdoor-indoor space with quiet alcoves and open plazas, and plentiful work is available here for talented adventurers.": "低语法庭的居民以物易物，换取当前的知识。传令官、传令员、吟游诗人和格里特人从活跃在城堡的15个创始文明以及其他土地上买卖信息。熟练的侦察员和间谍也可以受雇进行短期侦察或长期渗透。宫廷是一个室外和室内混合的空间，有安静的凹槽和开放的广场，有才华的冒险家可以在这里找到大量的工作。",
	"The Speakers for the Ancestors—the leaders of the Radiant Citadel—employ freelancers from the Court of Whispers to keep track of major concerns in their people's homelands, as well as potential threats to the Citadel, while the Shieldbearers of the Citadel (see the \"{@area Palace of Exile|014|x}\" section) seek information so they can identify crisis points where their operatives are needed. Even common citizens might hire folk from the Court to find missing loved ones, locate lost family treasures, or gather information on rivals.": "祖先的代言人--辐射城堡的领导人--从低语法庭雇佣自由职业者来跟踪他们人民的家乡的主要问题，以及对城堡的潜在威胁，而城堡的盾牌手（见\"{@area Palace of Exile|014|x} \"部分）则寻求信息，以便他们能够确定需要他们行动的危机点。即使是普通公民也可能雇用宫廷的人去寻找失踪的亲人，找到丢失的家庭财物，或者收集对手的信息。",
	"Powerful organizations and individuals from across the planes send agents to the Court of Whispers to collect information and do business on their behalf. Noteworthy examples include the Harpers of Abeir-Toril, Sigil's Fraternity of Order, and agents of the planes-traveling gnome fixer Vi.": "各个星球上有实力的组织和个人都会派特工到私语法庭收集信息并代表他们做生意。值得一提的例子包括Abeir-Toril的哈珀斯，Sigil的秩序兄弟会，以及各星球旅行的地精修理工维的代理人。",
	"The House of Convalescence focuses the life-giving energies of the Auroral Diamond, allowing for incredible feats of healing magic. This makes the House of Convalescence an oasis for the sick, the injured, and the desperate. It also draws clerics and healers of many traditions. Most come to serve those in need, but some seek to understand the magical properties of the place itself.": "康复之家集中了极光之钻的生命能量，使其能够发挥不可思议的治疗魔法。这使得疗养院成为病人、伤员和绝望者的绿洲。它也吸引了许多传统的神职人员和治疗师。大多数人是来为有需要的人服务的，但也有一些人寻求了解这个地方本身的魔法特性。",
	"Magic is affected in the following ways in the House of Convalescence:": "魔法在疗养院中会受到以下影响。",
	"When the spells {@spell raise dead}, {@spell resurrection}, {@spell revivify}, or {@spell true resurrection} are cast in the House of Convalescence, a diamond material component is never required.": "当在疗养院中施展{@spell raise dead}、{@spell resurrection}、{@spell revivify}或{@spell true resurrection}的法术时，从不需要钻石材料成分。",
	"When creatures would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell, they instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring {@dice 2d6} hit points to a creature, a spellcaster restores 12.": "当生物通常会掷出一个或多个骰子来用法术恢复命中率时，他们反而会使用每个骰子可能的最高数字。例如，施法者不是给生物恢复{@dice 2d6}的命中率，而是恢复12。",
	"Just beyond the light of the Radiant Citadel rages the Keening Gloom, a massive ethereal cyclone. Nothing that enters the cyclone is seen again.": "就在辐射堡垒的光芒之外，Keening Gloom肆虐，这是一个巨大的空灵旋风。进入旋风的东西都不会再被看到。",
	"When explorers rediscovered the Citadel, the Keening Gloom hungrily circled the city. Its endless howl struck terror in their hearts and engulfed several adventurers. After the heroes entered the Citadel and reawakened its power, the cyclone was driven back. But in times of turmoil within the Citadel, the cyclone ominously draws closer.": "当探险家们重新发现学城的时候，震怒的阴霾贪婪地绕着城市。它无休止的嚎叫在他们心中造成了恐怖，并吞噬了几个冒险者。在英雄们进入城堡并重新唤醒它的力量后，旋风被赶了回来。但在城堡内部发生动荡的时候，旋风不祥地靠近。",
	"Scholars have studied the Keening Gloom for decades but have only theories about its nature, its connection to the Radiant Citadel, and what befalls those caught in its terrible throes. Many fear the cyclone cannot be held at bay forever.": "学者们研究Keening Gloom已经有几十年了，但对它的性质、它与辐射堡垒的联系以及那些陷入其可怕阵痛的人的遭遇只有理论。许多人担心旋风不可能永远被抑制住。",
	"The adventurers who discovered and reoccupied the Radiant Citadel were from the civilizations that founded the city long ago. Among them, several had been set on the path of adventure after conflict or disaster drove them from their homes, and the Citadel provided solace. In turn, they established the Palace of Exile to help others in need.": "发现并重新占领辐射堡垒的冒险家们来自很久以前建立这个城市的文明。在他们当中，有几个人是在冲突或灾难将他们赶出家园后走上冒险之路的，而城堡提供了慰藉。反过来，他们建立了流亡宫来帮助其他有需要的人。",
	"The palace was named in honor of Socorro the Exile, its founding leader. He was a refugee of war in the land of San Citlán, and he selected one of the most beautiful complexes in the Citadel to house the needy as they arrived. He swore that while his homeland was occupied, he would be an exile and would make his home in the Palace, alongside any others with nowhere else to go.": "这座宫殿是为了纪念流亡者索科罗而命名的，他是宫殿的创始者。他是圣西特兰土地上的战争难民，他选择了城堡中最漂亮的建筑群之一，以安置抵达的贫困者。他发誓，当他的祖国被占领时，他将成为一名流亡者，并将在皇宫里安家，与其他无处可去的人一起。",
	"The Palace of Exile has spacious living quarters with adjoining gardens and recovery centers, where refugees are cared for physically, mentally, and emotionally as they make the transition to either living in the Radiant Citadel permanently or relocating to a new land. The Palace's staff coordinate with the House of Convalescence to provide the best possible aid to the sick and wounded.": "流亡宫有宽敞的生活区，并有相邻的花园和康复中心，难民在这里得到身体、精神和情感上的照顾，因为他们要过渡到永久居住在辐射堡垒或搬迁到新的土地。宫殿的工作人员与疗养院协调，为病人和伤员提供尽可能好的援助。",
	"The Shieldbearers, the Radiant Citadel's dedicated search-and-rescue force, are headquartered at the Palace of Exile. Where there is a need, the Shieldbearers help.": "盾牌手是辐射城的专门搜救部队，总部设在流放宫。只要有需要，盾牌手就会帮忙。",
	"The Preserve of the Ancestors is a sprawling, domed wilderness cut into the heart of the Auroral Diamond. Lush vegetation grows directly out of the diamond, and the expanse is dotted with jackalberry trees, whistling thorn, and zebrawood. Insects, small birds, and the occasional hare make their home here. In the center of the Preserve is a circular, in-ground amphitheater that serves as the meeting place of the Citadel's ruling council, the Speakers for the Ancestors.": "祖先保护区是一片广阔的、圆顶的荒野，被切割在极光钻石的中心。郁郁葱葱的植被直接从钻石中生长出来，广袤的土地上点缀着越橘树、哨子刺和斑马木。昆虫、小鸟和偶尔出现的野兔在这里安家。保护区的中心是一个圆形的地下圆形剧场，它是城主统治委员会的会议场所，即祖先的发言人。",
	"While the Preserve has little indigenous wildlife—mostly birds and small mammals—a sect of druids frequently brings injured animals here to be healed and rehabilitated. The Preserve is where the druids keep animals that can no longer survive in their native habitats, creating a menagerie of rare creatures from across many worlds.": "虽然保护区没有什么本土野生动物--主要是鸟类和小型哺乳动物--但一个德鲁伊教派经常把受伤的动物带到这里来治疗和康复。保护区是德鲁伊们饲养那些不能再在其原生地生存的动物的地方，创造了一个由来自许多世界的稀有生物组成的马戏团。",
	"Drawn by the power of the Auroral Diamond, spirits from countless lands make their home in the Preserve. Spirits from the same lands or of similar origins inhabit tiny jewels and assemble into amalgamations known as Incarnates. Some are small collections of spirits, but the greatest—related to the citadel's founding civilizations—are larger-than-life beings that embody the wisdom of ages (see the {@area \"Incarnates\" section|022|x} for details).": "在极光钻石力量的吸引下，来自无数土地的灵魂在保护区安家。来自同一片土地或相似起源的灵魂居住在小小的珠宝中，并聚集成被称为 \"化身 \"的组合。有些是小型的灵体集合，但最伟大的灵体与城堡的创始文明有关，是比生命还大的生命，体现了时代的智慧（详情见（%0%））。",
	"Encircling the Auroral Diamond, the Trade Discal is a massive marketplace designed so that the founding civilizations could trade on equitable terms. It serves the needs of cities and nations or major trading companies, rather than individual sellers or producers, which is enforced by its high taxes and fees. Large quantities of goods, such as entire herds of animals or tons of metal ore, can be transported via the Concord Jewels (described below) to the Trade Discal quickly and safely.": "围绕着极光钻石，贸易盘是一个巨大的市场，旨在使创始文明能够在公平的条件下进行贸易。它为城市和国家或主要贸易公司的需求服务，而不是为个人卖家或生产者服务，这一点通过其高额的税收和费用得以实施。大量的货物，如整群的动物或成吨的金属矿石，可以通过协和宝石（如下所述）快速而安全地运到贸易盘区。",
	"The Trade Discal is a vital outlet; if something were to happen to it, the impact would be severe for both the Radiant Citadel and the civilizations that depend on it. Adventurers are sometimes hired to oversee the transport of commodities to and from the Citadel or to negotiate on behalf of a major trading company or government. Normally this is a smooth process, but when large amounts of gold are involved, trade is never risk free.": "贸易盘是一个重要的出口；如果它出了问题，对辐射城和依赖它的文明都会产生严重影响。冒险家们有时会被雇来监督商品进出城堡的运输，或者代表主要的贸易公司或政府进行谈判。通常这是一个顺利的过程，但是当涉及到大量的黄金时，贸易从来都是没有风险的。",
	"Beyond the Radiant Citadel drift the Concord Jewels, which connect the city to its founding civilizations. Each Jewel is a building-sized vessel capable of holding hundreds of people and tons of goods. Though the Jewels take a variety of shapes, their interiors are similar. A cylindrical core holds containers for goods, including livestock. Surrounding the core is seating for passengers. The Citadel employs official operators called Clavigers to pilot the Jewels.": "在光芒四射的城堡之外，漂浮着协和宝石，它们将城市与它的创始文明联系起来。每个宝石都是一个建筑物大小的船只，能够容纳数百人和数吨货物。虽然宝石有各种不同的形状，但它们的内部结构是相似的。圆柱形的核心部分放置货物的容器，包括牲畜。环绕核心的是乘客的座位。城堡雇佣了名为Clavigers的官方操作员来驾驶宝石号。",
	"Each Concord Jewel is linked to one of the civilizations that founded the Radiant Citadel. A Jewel unerringly travels between the Radiant Citadel and the homeland of the Jewel's linked people. Even if the Jewel's people have migrated to another world on the Material Plane, the Jewel finds its way to their current home. While not in use, the Concord Jewels orbit the Radiant Citadel in an incandescent constellation. Each Jewel corresponds to one of the founding civilizations and resembles a giant gemstone of the type noted for that civilization on the Concord Jewels table. Missing civilizations and their Jewels are not listed and can be detailed as you please.": "每颗协和宝石都与创建辐射城堡的其中一个文明有关。宝石会准确无误地在辐射城堡和宝石所属民族的故乡之间旅行。即使宝石的人民已经迁移到物质世界的另一个世界，宝石也能找到他们现在的家。在不使用时，协和宝石会以白炽灯星座的形式绕着辐射堡垒运行。每颗宝石都对应着一个创始文明，并类似于Concord Jewels表上注明的该文明类型的巨大宝石。缺少的文明和它们的宝石没有被列出，可以按照你的要求进行详细说明。",

	"At a Concord Jewel's center are controls for the structure. A creature adjacent to these controls that spends a minute manipulating them can make a DC 14 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana}) check. On a success, the creature can direct the Concord Jewel to take one of the following actions:": "在Concord Jewel的中心是该结构的控制装置。与这些控制装置相邻的生物如果花一分钟时间来操纵它们，可以进行DC14智力（（%0%））检查。如果成功，该生物可以指挥Concord Jewel采取以下行动之一。",
	"When commanded to land, the Jewel automatically settles into a safe position adjoining the Radiant Citadel or on the surface of a Material Plane world. From this site, creatures can move back and forth between the Jewel and the location. Sections of the exterior walls of the lowest 15 feet of the Jewel then become immaterial and semitransparent, allowing passage into and out of the Jewel.": "当被命令着陆时，宝石会自动降落到毗邻辐射城堡或物质世界表面的一个安全位置。从这个地方，生物可以在宝石和地点之间来回移动。宝石最低15英尺的外墙部分会变成非物质的半透明状态，允许进出宝石的通道。",
	"A Jewel that has landed moves away from a location. If the Jewel is near the Radiant Citadel, it moves into the open Ethereal Plane and orbits the city. Otherwise, it rises 600 feet off the ground and hovers. A Jewel flies at a rate of 50 feet per round.": "着陆后的宝石会远离某个地点。如果宝石在辐射城堡附近，它就会移动到开放的虚无空间，并围绕城市运行。否则，它就会升到离地600英尺的地方盘旋。宝石的飞行速度为每回合50英尺。",
	"The Jewel and everything on it shifts between planes. When it does so, it teleports either to the Deep Ethereal several thousand feet away from the Radiant Citadel or to a specific site on the Material Plane in the land the Jewel is linked to. When a Jewel teleports to its linked land, it appears 600 feet above a site where it can land and hovers there. The location where a Jewel arrives is noted in the \"Setting the Adventure\" section of each of this book's adventures.": "宝石和它上面的所有东西都会在不同的位面之间转移。当它这样做时，它要么传送到离辐射城堡几千英尺远的深空，要么传送到物质世界中宝石所链接的土地上的一个特定地点。当宝石传送到它所链接的土地上时，它会出现在一个它可以降落的地方上方600英尺处，并在那里盘旋。宝石到达的地点在本书每个冒险的 \"设置冒险 \"部分都有说明。",
	"Clavigers oversee the Concord Jewels. Each Speaker for the Ancestors chooses the Clavigers for the Jewel linked to that Speaker's civilization. A dozen Clavigers are assigned to each Concord Jewel, and at least two keep watch from each Jewel as it orbits the Radiant Citadel and guide it during its travels. Clavigers not only maintain transit and trade to and from the Radiant Citadel but also serve as ambassadors from the city to the founding civilizations. Many Clavigers go on to become Speakers for the Ancestors.": "克拉维格人负责监督协和宝石。每位祖先的发言人都会为与该发言人的文明相关的宝石选择Clavigers。每颗协和宝石都有一打Clavigers，至少有两名Clavigers在每颗宝石绕着辐射城堡运行时进行监视，并在其旅行中进行指导。Clavigers不仅维护辐射城的交通和贸易，而且还充当城市与创始文明的大使。许多克拉维格人后来都成为了祖先的发言人。",
	"The Radiant Citadel is a city of immigrants. Several of the explorers who reclaimed the Citadel were refugees who escaped hardships that plagued their lands. They chose the Citadel as their home, despite its strangeness and the surreal surroundings of the Deep Ethereal, as it presented an opportunity to start anew. Most of the city's current inhabitants are descendants of the fifteen founding civilizations active in the Citadel, but all are welcome.": "辐射堡垒是一座移民城市。开垦学城的几位探险家都是难民，他们逃离了困扰他们土地的苦难。他们选择学城作为他们的家园，尽管学城很陌生，而且深空的环境也很不真实，因为它提供了一个重新开始的机会。城市目前的大部分居民是活跃在城堡的15个创始文明的后裔，但我们欢迎所有的人。",
	"Some find living in the Deep Ethereal too disquieting to stay or chafe at the confines of the Citadel. Others depart out of fear that the Keening Gloom will destroy the Citadel. Their numbers are replenished by new arrivals who seek a different life, want to study the city's lore, or find solace in the city's peace and safety. The Citadel's society is shaped by this ebb and flow. Traditions, customs, and values are a mix of old and new; while some adhere to rituals no longer followed in their homeland, others create their own novel practices.": "有些人觉得生活在虚无深渊中太令人不安了，不愿意留下来，或者对城堡的束缚感到厌烦。另一些人则是由于担心 \"振奋的阴霾 \"会摧毁城堡而离开的。他们的人数由新来的人补充，他们寻求不同的生活，想要研究城市的传说，或者在城市的和平和安全中找到慰藉。学城的社会就是在这种起伏中形成的。传统、习俗和价值观是新旧的混合体；有些人坚持他们家乡不再遵循的仪式，有些人则创造了他们自己的新做法。",
	"The Radiant Citadel's diaspora communities constantly learn and borrow from one another, creating a culture unique to the city. This evolution is displayed in the art, the clothing, the music, and—perhaps mostly vividly—the food of the city. While cantinas, tea houses, and eateries serve food and drink from specific communities, the most popular cuisines are fusion dishes like couscous infused with habanero and saffron, panela-coated fried yams, and kimchi tacos.": "辐射城的散居社区不断地相互学习和借鉴，创造了这个城市的独特文化。这种演变表现在艺术、服装、音乐和--也许最生动的是--城市的食物。虽然坎蒂纳斯（cantinas）、茶馆和餐馆提供来自特定社区的食物和饮料，但最受欢迎的美食是融合菜肴，如用哈瓦那和藏红花浸泡的库斯库斯，涂有面板的炸山药和泡菜玉米饼。",
	"Relationships between the Radiant Citadel and the founding civilizations are often shifting. The Citadel sends diplomats abroad and houses embassies from foreign governments, but this goodwill is not always reciprocated. The Citadel's uniqueness makes it a target of foreign actors who seek to exert subtle or overt control over it. At the same time, political activists, dissidents, and revolutionaries seek to exploit the city's neutrality to their advantage, even staging incursions against their home governments from the relative safety of the Citadel.": "辐射堡垒和创始文明之间的关系往往是变化不定的。城堡向国外派遣外交官，并为外国政府的大使馆提供住所，但这种善意并不总是得到回报。城堡的独特性使它成为外国行动者的目标，他们试图对它进行微妙或公开的控制。同时，政治活动家、持不同政见者和革命者试图利用这座城市的中立性为自己谋利，甚至从相对安全的城堡中发动对其本国政府的入侵。",
	"The Radiant Citadel is governed by a council known as the Speakers for the Ancestors. Each Speaker is a descendant of one of the founding civilizations currently known to the Citadel. They are chosen by their community and affirmed into office by the wise and ancient Dawn Incarnates. The Speakers for the Ancestors meet openly in the amphitheater in the center of the Preserve, and Citadel residents often watch their debates. All laws and major decisions of the city are decided by majority vote of the Speakers. Debates can become heated; because each Speaker represents very different constituents, consensus and compromises might take days or even months to reach. Those citizens of mixed ancestry or unconnected to the founding civilizations can choose a Speaker for the Ancestors to represent them. They register with the Speaker's office, and from then on, participate in future elections for that Speaker.": "辐射堡垒由一个被称为 \"祖先发言人 \"的理事会管理。每个议长都是城堡目前已知的创始文明之一的后裔。他们由他们的社区选择，并由智慧而古老的黎明化身确认上任。祖先的发言人在保护区中心的圆形剧场公开开会，城主府居民经常观看他们的辩论。城市的所有法律和重大决定都由议长们的多数票来决定。辩论可能会变得激烈；因为每个议长代表着非常不同的选民，共识和妥协可能需要几天甚至几个月的时间才能达成。那些混合血统或与创始文明无关的公民可以选择一位祖先的议长来代表他们。他们在议长办公室登记，并从那时起，参与该议长的未来选举。",
	"Governance is public, transparent, and participatory. Laws are not static but evolve to meet new challenges and needs. Subcouncils and committees manage the city under the guidance of the Speakers. Complexities persist in governing a highly diverse city with varied customs, beliefs, and social norms, but robust civic engagement helps the city overcome adversity.": "治理是公开、透明和参与性的。法律不是一成不变的，而是不断发展以满足新的挑战和需求。小组委员会和委员会在议长的指导下管理城市。治理一个具有不同习俗、信仰和社会规范的高度多元化的城市仍然存在复杂的问题，但强有力的公民参与有助于城市克服逆境。",
	"Public safety and peacekeeping are administered through a variety of councils and organizations designed to address specific issues. The House of Convalescence helps those living with mental illness, while inspectors investigate nonviolent crimes and use nonlethal methods of detainment. Theft is uncommon in the city, and rehabilitation and restorative justice are preferred methods of addressing wrongs. Highly trained local guards mobilize to handle the rare incidents of violence, and citizens are expected to proactively intervene if needed. The worst offenders are sentenced to a controversial Djaynaian punishment wherein the criminal is subjected to a ritual that prevents them from repeating their crime and then is banished from the city.": "公共安全和维持和平是通过各种旨在解决具体问题的理事会和组织来管理的。疗养院帮助那些患有精神疾病的人，而检查员则调查非暴力犯罪并使用非致命的拘留方法。盗窃行为在该市并不常见，康复和恢复性司法是处理错误的首选方法。训练有素的当地卫兵动员起来处理罕见的暴力事件，而公民则被期望在必要时主动干预。最严重的罪犯会被判处有争议的Djaynaian刑罚，在这种刑罚下，罪犯会接受一种仪式，防止他们再次犯罪，然后被驱逐出城市。",
	"Denizens of the Radiant Citadel strive to sustain an egalitarian society. Every citizen is entitled to a basic income that affords them the necessities of living and dignity in lifestyle. Food, water, and green spaces are equally accessible throughout the city. The House of Convalescence turns no one away; healing is priced according to one's means, and the poorest are served without charge. All housing is public, distributed, and administered through the city's councils.": "辐射堡垒的居民努力维持一个平等的社会。每个公民都有权获得基本的收入，使他们获得生活的必需品和生活方式的尊严。食物、水和绿地在整个城市都可以平等地获得。疗养院不拒人于千里之外；治疗是根据个人的能力来定价的，最贫穷的人可以免费获得服务。所有的住房都是公共的，分配的，并通过城市的理事会进行管理。",
	"Since the city's resources are limited due to the Citadel's relatively small area and its strange nature, foodstuffs and other materials are carefully conserved, and goods are reused or recycled when possible. Similarly, most food is vegetarian and is grown in green spaces throughout the city. Whether served in a home or an eatery, most animal products must be imported and so are subject to high tariffs.": "由于城堡的面积相对较小，加上其奇怪的性质，城市的资源是有限的，因此食品和其他材料都被小心翼翼地保存起来，货物尽可能地被重新使用或回收。同样，大多数食物都是素食，并在整个城市的绿地上种植。无论是在家里还是在餐馆里，大多数动物产品都必须进口，因此要缴纳高额关税。",
	"Taxes are progressive to help reduce the gap between the most affluent and the poorest. High tariffs on imports keep the public coffers full, but the Speakers lower or remove tariffs for civilizations in trouble. Similarly, visitors to the Radiant Citadel pay a toll to enter. Those who come with nothing except good will pay no fee. Those with big pockets and big hearts give more according to their conscience rather than risk the rebuke of the city's guards. Rich and poor alike can instead offer something unique that might be to the liking of the Incarnates, such as a lost song, a secret tale, or a rare piece of art. Those who choose this option may present their gift to the Dawn Incarnate of their choice. If their toll is accepted, the visitor is allowed to stay in the Citadel.": "税收是累进的，以帮助减少最富裕的人和最贫穷的人之间的差距。对进口商品征收的高额关税使国库充盈，但议长们对有困难的文明降低或取消关税。同样地，进入辐射城堡的游客也要支付通行费。那些除了好东西之外什么都没带的人则不需要支付任何费用。那些腰缠万贯、心胸宽广的人根据自己的良心付出更多，而不是冒着被城市守卫斥责的风险。富人和穷人都可以提供一些独特的东西，可能是化身喜欢的，如一首失落的歌曲，一个秘密的故事，或一件罕见的艺术品。选择这种方式的人可以将他们的礼物送给他们选择的黎明化身。如果他们的通行费被接受，访客就被允许留在城堡里。",
	"Several groups hold influence within the Radiant Citadel, guiding and protecting the city's peoples.": "有几个团体在辐射堡垒内拥有影响力，指导和保护该城市的人民。",
	"The keepers of vast wisdom from distant lands, the Incarnates are collections of spirits bound within gemstones. Each of an Incarnate's component gemstones holds a spirit from the same land on the Material Plane. These might be nature spirits from a particular place or the spirits of individuals who once dwelled there. Upon forming, an Incarnate manifests a unique personality and identity, a gestalt of its constituents and their shared background. The greater the number of spirits that make up an Incarnate, the broader and deeper both its personality and its knowledge are.": "化身是来自遥远国度的巨大智慧的守护者，是绑定在宝石中的精神集合。每个化身的组成宝石都有一个来自物质世界同一片土地上的精神。这些可能是某个地方的自然之灵，或者是曾经居住在那里的个人之灵。形成后，一个化身会表现出独特的个性和身份，是其组成成分及其共同背景的集合体。组成化身的灵体数量越多，其个性和知识就越广泛和深入。",
	"Most Incarnates are small, no more than a handful of gems in the shape of a plant or animal. The least of them originate from spirits lost on the Ethereal Plane and are tiny collections of wayward spirits of similar origins with nowhere else to go. The largest and most influential are those of the fifteen founding civilizations collectively known as the Dawn Incarnates. Spanning more than a dozen feet in height, these Incarnates are composed of thousands of smaller gems of the same type. Each holds court in a portion of the Preserve, such as the Amethyst Tiger's knoll or the Obsidian Eagle's aerie.": "大多数化身都很小，不超过一小撮植物或动物形状的宝石。其中最小的化身来自于迷失在虚空界的灵魂，是起源相似、无处可去的落魄灵魂的微小集合。最大和最有影响力的是那些被统称为黎明化身的15个创始文明。这些化身的高度超过十几英尺，由成千上万的同类型的小宝石组成。每个人都在保护地的某一区域开庭，如紫晶虎的小山丘或黑曜石鹰的小房间。",
	"The Dawn Incarnates have existed since the creation of the Radiant Citadel. While the Citadel's creators left behind no texts, it's believed that their collective wisdom is held by the Dawn Incarnates.": "黎明化身自辐射堡垒创建以来就一直存在。虽然学城的创造者没有留下任何文字，但人们相信他们的集体智慧由黎明化身掌握。",
	"The Dawn Incarnates know everything that transpires in the Preserve of the Ancestors, which is why they require the Speakers for the Ancestors to meet there. While they do not interfere in the day-to-day administration of the city, they hold the Speakers responsible to the duties of their office. While a Dawn Incarnate has never removed a Speaker for the Ancestors (see \"{@area Speakers for the Ancestors|026|x}\" below), it is believed they could do so if displeased.": "黎明化身知道祖先保护区内发生的一切，这就是为什么他们要求祖先的发言人在那里开会。虽然他们不干涉城市的日常管理，但他们要求议长们对其办公室的职责负责。虽然黎明化身从未撤换过祖先发言人（见下面的\"{@area Speakers for the Ancestors|026|x}\"），但人们相信，如果他们不高兴，可以这样做。",
	"Each Incarnate has a unique, amalgamated personality. Most who interact with an Incarnate interact with this primary identity. However, an Incarnate's primary personality is not a repository of its constituent spirits' knowledge; these spirits have their own thoughts and personalities. While an Incarnate broadly knows what its spirits know, a wealth of information is locked inside them. A constituent spirit within an Incarnate might be awakened by evoking the spirit's name or presenting something of significance to that spirit. Once a spirit is awakened, it takes over as the dominant personality of the Incarnate for a matter of minutes and might share its specific memories.": "每个化身都有一个独特的、混合的个性。大多数与化身互动的人都与这个主要身份互动。然而，一个化身的主要人格并不是其组成灵体的知识库；这些灵体有自己的思想和个性。虽然一个化身广泛地知道它的精神所知道的东西，但大量的信息被锁在它们里面。一个化身中的组成灵体可能会被唤醒，唤起该灵体的名字，或者向该灵体展示一些重要的东西。一旦一个精神被唤醒，它就会在几分钟内成为化身的主导人格，并可能分享其特定的记忆。",
	"A spirit knows only what it has observed. A nature spirit that inhabited a small pond might know a great deal about the fisher who visited its banks every week for fifty years, but might not know that person's name or where they lived. An ancestor spirit might know the intimate details of their family and town, but nothing about their neighbor's great-grandchildren. Each spirit is a single window into the civilization; together, an Incarnate's spirits have a wide but not infallible perspective on the history of their people.": "一个精神只知道它所观察到的东西。一个居住在小池塘里的自然之灵可能知道很多关于50年来每星期到池塘边的渔夫的事情，但可能不知道那个人的名字或他们住在哪里。一个祖先的灵魂可能知道他们的家庭和城镇的亲密细节，但对他们邻居的曾孙子却一无所知。每个精神都是了解文明的一个窗口；一个化身的精神在一起，对他们民族的历史有一个广泛但并非无懈可击的视角。",
	"An Incarnate and its constituent spirits are not malicious or duplicitous, but they do not necessarily answer questions easily or without a price. Some require the completion of a quest, while others might give a puzzle to solve. Some speak plainly; others respond in poem or parable. And some refuse to speak at all.": "一个化身及其组成的精神不是恶意的或两面派的，但他们不一定轻易回答问题或不付出代价。有的需要完成任务，有的则可能提供一个谜题来解决。有的直言不讳；有的则以诗或寓言的方式回应。而有些则根本拒绝说话。",

	"The Speakers for the Ancestors face incredible challenges in their role. They must maintain the internal stability of a large and diverse city and ensure its people are treated equally and fairly under the law. Simultaneously, they manage a complex relationship with the founding civilizations. The Speakers' first duty is to the Radiant Citadel, which sometimes puts them at odds with the governments of the founding civilizations, particularly in tariff disputes or major crises. Thus far, the Radiant Citadel's policy is to resolutely remain neutral in all conflicts—whether they involve the founding civilizations or otherwise. However, the Citadel seeks to rescue refugees and send humanitarian aid to the limits of its resources.": "祖先的发言人在他们的角色中面临着难以置信的挑战。他们必须维持一个大型多元化城市的内部稳定，并确保其人民在法律下得到平等和公正的对待。同时，他们还要处理与创始文明的复杂关系。议长们的首要职责是对辐射城堡负责，这有时会使他们与创始文明的政府发生冲突，特别是在关税争端或重大危机中。到目前为止，辐射城的政策是在所有的冲突中坚决保持中立--无论它们是否涉及创始文明。然而，城堡在其资源有限的情况下，寻求救援难民和发送人道主义援助。",
	"While decisions by the Speakers are made by simple majority, each Speaker has a very powerful veto that prevents them from being marginalized by political alliances.": "虽然议长的决定是由简单多数做出的，但每个议长都有非常强大的否决权，以防止他们被政治联盟边缘化。",

	"Once a Speaker no longer holds office, they lose the powers related to their position. If a Speaker steps down before the end of their term or dies while in office, all basic necessities in the Radiant Citadel gradually cease to function. Unless a suitable replacement for that Speaker is elected and approved by the Dawn Incarnates within thirty days, plants in the Radiant Citadel stop growing, wells run dry, and lighting ceases to function. Similarly, a Speaker cannot leave the Radiant Citadel for more than thirty days before the city's basic utilities begin to fail.": "一旦议长不再任职，他们就会失去与其职位相关的权力。如果一个议长在任期结束前下台，或者在任期内死亡，辐射城堡的所有基本必需品都会逐渐停止运作。除非在三十天内选出合适的议长替代者并得到黎明化身的批准，否则辐射城堡的植物就会停止生长，水井就会干涸，照明也会停止运作。同样地，在城市的基本设施开始失效之前，议长不能离开辐射城超过三十天。",

	"Sholeh is a legendary figure in the history of the Citadel. Having led the successful effort to rediscover the Radiant Citadel, she was the first Speaker for the Ancestors and is the only originator of that position to still hold the office. This is, at least in part, because she is a famed {@creature ancient brass dragon} of Akharin Sangar. Unlike many of her kind, she is neutral good and a pragmatic, shrewd leader.

	"She has a complex relationship with her homeland. While she loves Akharin Sangar, she refuses to bend to the will of its angelic ruler, Atash. Rather than oppose him directly, she plays a delicate political game even as she worries about the future of her native land.": "她与她的祖国有着复杂的关系。虽然她爱Akharin Sangar，但她拒绝屈服于其天使般的统治者Atash的意志。她没有直接反对他，而是玩了一个微妙的政治游戏，甚至在她担心她的祖国的未来。",

	"Now in his forties, he leads the Shieldbearers. He is a canny tactician and a highly competent leader, but he bristles against the rules of engagement imposed on the Shieldbearers by the Speakers for the Ancestors.

Although it's not evident, the soul shaker's evil and the excavations of the crawling claws have spoiled the land around the house.": "小麦和玉米在房子周围的田里艰难地生长着。任何通过DC14智力（（%0%））检查成功的人物都能看出这个农场周围的植物是病态的，因为土壤出了问题。通过DC16智慧（（%1%））检查成功的人物可以注意到泥土中凸起的路径，就像鼹鼠隧道，虽然没有明显的生物。虽然不明显，但震魂人的邪恶和爬行的爪子的挖掘已经破坏了房子周围的土地。",

	"A large wooden porch wraps around the front and one side of the farmhouse. Its planks creak ominously when stepped on, but there is no danger here. Closed curtains shroud the windows, but the doors to the interior are unlocked and ajar. Both lead to a musty central hallway.": "一个大的木制门廊环绕着农舍的正面和一侧。踩在木板上会发出不祥的响声，但这里没有危险。紧闭的窗帘遮住了窗户，但通往室内的门却没有上锁，而是虚掩着。两扇门都通向一个发霉的中央走廊。",

	"The art style is similar to that of the picture Aunt Dellie found in Promise. Any character who succeeds on a DC 14 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check notices a break in the pattern under a chair.

Scrapes in the muddy image form the name \"Culley.\"": "艺术风格类似于戴丽阿姨在《承诺》中发现的图片。任何通过DC14智慧({@skill Perception})检查成功的人物都会注意到椅子下面的图案有了破损。如果移动椅子，它就会显示出两个孩子的泥泞形象--他们正伸手去抓另一个孩子，而后者正被大手拖入水中。泥泞画面上的刮痕形成了 \"Culley \"这个名字。",

	"In the center of the room, four enchanted farmers stand facing each other, their crimson eyes unblinking. Each holds a sharp knife or farming implement.

	"As the characters move through the tunnel, the song's volume increases. The characters recognize this as part of the Awakening Song they overheard in Promise. This part of the song tells the story of a young man named Culley. Rather than its usual content, where the boy dies by drowning, the song has been sloppily rewritten to feature Culley being saved by his closest friend.": "随着人物在隧道中的移动，歌曲的音量增大。人物认识到这是他们在《承诺》中偷听到的《觉醒之歌》的一部分。这首歌的这一部分讲述了一个名叫Culley的年轻人的故事。与其说这首歌的内容是男孩溺水而死，不如说它被草率地改写为Culley被他最亲密的朋友所救。",
	"The tunnel opens into a lantern-lit, packed-dirt chamber, where the cause of the stench becomes apparent. A dozen bodies lie strewn across the floor, all wearing the clothes of farmers. Many of their limbs have been cleanly removed and set into a sizable pile on the far side of the cavern. In the center of the room, a young woman is singing.": "地道通向一个有灯笼照明的拥挤的土室，那里的恶臭原因变得很明显。十几具尸体散落在地板上，都穿着农民的衣服。他们中的许多人的肢体已被干净地切除，并在洞穴的远处堆成一个相当大的堆。在房间的中央，一个年轻女子正在唱歌。",

	"The young woman is Kianna (chaotic neutral, human {@creature commoner}). She looks like she's in a dream state, and she holds a knife loosely, but her eyes aren't crimson like those of the other farmers. Kianna stops singing as soon as she notices the characters and says, \"Please go. You shouldn't be here.\" If the characters speak with Kianna, she drifts between fearfully urging them to leave and coaxing them to stay and meet her friend, Culley, her mood and manner shifting erratically. Use the following points to guide the conversation:": "这个年轻女人是基安纳（混沌中立，人类（%0%））。她看起来像是在做梦，她松散地拿着一把刀，但她的眼睛不像其他农民那样是深红色的。基安纳一注意到这些人物就停止唱歌，并说：\"请走吧。你不应该在这里。\" 如果人物与基安娜交谈，她会在恐惧地催促他们离开和哄骗他们留下来见她的朋友卡尔利之间徘徊，她的情绪和态度变化无常。用以下几点来引导对话。",

	"If asked where Culley is now, Kianna fearfully says he's sleeping after having fed. She believes her song helps keep him quiet, but she's tired.": "如果被问及库尔利现在在哪里，基安娜害怕地说他吃完饭后在睡觉。她相信她的歌声有助于让他保持安静，但她很累。",

	"When the characters try to leave the area or disturb the pile of limbs, the heap begins to move, revealing itself as an Undead made entirely of arms and hands. This is a {@creature soul shaker|JttRC} (detailed at the {@area end of this adventure|0eb|x}). This creature has a fraction of the memories of Kianna's friend Culley, but the horror has perverted those thoughts, seeking to control Kianna, manipulate her guilt, and use her to lure other victims into its lair. When it reveals itself, the soul shaker targets a character with its telepathy, whispering things like \"Come play with us!\", \"Are you lonely?\", and \"Be with us forever!\" as it attacks. It might also relate snippets from the \"{@area Fractured Soul|091|x}\" section of the adventure's background.": "当人物试图离开这个区域或打扰这堆肢体时，这堆肢体开始移动，显示出它是一个完全由手臂和手组成的亡灵。这是一个（%0%）（详见（%1%））。这个生物拥有Kianna的朋友Culley的一小部分记忆，但这个恐怖的东西已经扭曲了这些思想，试图控制Kianna，操纵她的罪恶感，并利用她来引诱其他受害者进入它的巢穴。当它现身时，灵魂震荡者会用心灵感应瞄准一个角色，在攻击时低声说：\"来和我们一起玩吧！\"、\"你很孤独吗？\"、\"永远和我们在一起！\"等。它还可能讲述冒险背景中的\"{@area Fractured Soul|091|x} \"部分的片段。",

She wakes after an hour, unable to remember anything that's happened in recent days except for glimpses of strange hands and menacing words spoken in her dead friend Culley's voice. Kianna shares that she blames herself for Culley's death at Cradlelace Lake, and when she heard his voice, she thought the gods might be giving her a chance to make amends. Now she just wants to return to Promise.": "灵魂震荡器被摧毁后，基安纳陷入了昏迷。检查她并成功通过DC14智慧（{@skill Medicine}）检查的人物可以看出基安纳睡眠不足，并被那个奇怪的生物折磨。她在一小时后醒来，除了瞥见一双奇怪的手和用她死去的朋友库尔利的声音说出的威胁性话语外，无法记起最近几天发生的任何事情。Kianna说她为Culley在摇篮湖的死亡感到自责，当她听到他的声音时，她认为神明可能会给她一个弥补的机会。现在她只想回到Promise身边。",
	"If asked about or shown her paintings from {@area areas F3|0c8|x} or {@area F4|0ca|x}, she has no memory of creating them, though they're clearly in her art style.

	"If any of the farmers survived, the crimson hue vanishes from their eyes after the soul shaker's destruction, and they thank the characters for saving them. Even if the farmers in the house didn't survive, one or two lost in the fields arrive at the farmhouse—perhaps with Proclaimer Ward.": "如果有农民幸存下来，那么在灵魂震荡器被摧毁后，深红色的色调就会从他们的眼中消失，他们会感谢这些人物救了他们。即使房子里的农民没有活下来，也有一两个在田里迷路的农民来到了农舍--也许是和宣称者沃德一起。",
	"The farmers remember only snippets from the last few days, and the last thing they recall clearly is preparing to return to Promise for the Awakening Festival.

The farmers can also relate details from the adventure's background or about Cradlelace Lake if asked.": "农民们只记得过去几天的一些片段，他们清楚地记得的最后一件事是准备回到普罗米斯参加觉醒节。他们还分享说，基安娜的行为很奇怪，越来越相信她死去的朋友在和她说话。如果被问及，农民们还可以讲述冒险背景中的细节或关于摇篮湖的细节。",
	"Although the farmers can't reward the characters with much in the way of wealth, they gift the group a {@item Heward's handy haversack} they had stashed with tools in a nearby shed.

Although this sometimes encourages exaggeration, Godsbreath's people believe you can hear truth in the telling of any tale, and all enjoy the art of a well-crafted boast.": "故事是将Godsbreath捆绑在一起的胶水，将其人民与帮助塑造这片土地的祖先联系在一起，并将传统和信仰在此后的所有世代中传承。这里的大多数人在交流故事之前，都会以 \"听一听 \"或 \"告诉我真相 \"作为谈话的开始--越吸引人越好。虽然这有时会鼓励夸大其词，但Godsbreath的人们相信你可以从任何故事中听到真相，而且所有人都喜欢精心制作的夸奖艺术。",

She used her magic to create the jeli flower, a crop with fantastic commercial value. In exchange, the six Kings of Coin were to give her their firstborn children to serve as apprentices. At the suggestion of one of their members, Myx Nargis Ruba, the Kings of Coin betrayed Proud Edun and murdered her instead of giving up their heirs.": "三月的副业节原本是为了表彰该市的整个葡萄酒贸易，但最近杰利酒成为了这一具有数百年历史的传统的焦点。然而，津达最近的繁荣隐藏着一个可怕的秘密。五年前，金币国王--津达的统治者--与一个名叫 \"骄傲的埃顿 \"的女巫建立了一个盟约。她用她的魔法创造了杰利花，一种具有神奇商业价值的作物。作为交换，六位金币国王将把他们的长子作为学徒送给她。在他们的成员之一Myx Nargis Ruba的建议下，硬币国王们背叛了骄傲的Edun，谋杀了她，而不是放弃他们的继承人。",

The other two divas use the {@creature scout} stat block and attack only with broken bottles that function the same as their Shortsword attack. As the divas are all under the effects of biza's breath, they each randomly make one melee attack against Zenia or a character on their turns.

	"In the aftermath of the battle, characters who inspect the stage, the divas, or their glitter and succeed on a DC 12 Wisdom ({@skill Perception}) check see the glitter left a film of pink ash on the divas and the floor around them.

	"The great gardens that spread to the west of the city are the source of Zinda's wealth. Many Zindanese laborers tend the jeli flowers that grow there, living in wood-and-stone huts in the heart of the gardens. These velvety flowers were discovered several years ago and can't be successfully cultivated elsewhere. Why Zinda is the only place where jeli flowers can grow is a mystery, but this single crop now supplies the city with raw materials for wine, dye, fabric, and paper. Gardeners occasionally fall prey to wicked spirits, zombies, and green hags that lurk in the jungle beyond the city, as Zinda has no standing army to protect these outlying regions.": "蔓延到城市西部的大花园是津达的财富来源。许多津达的劳动者照料生长在那里的杰利花，住在花园中心的木石小屋中。这些天鹅绒般的花朵是几年前发现的，其他地方无法成功种植。为什么津达是唯一可以种植洁丽花的地方，这是一个谜，但这种单一的作物现在为城市提供了酒、染料、织物和纸张的原材料。园丁们偶尔会成为潜伏在城外丛林中的恶灵、僵尸和绿女巫的猎物，因为津达没有常备军来保护这些外围地区。",

Eventually, political tensions turned the folk hero into a figure of infamy. Meanwhile, Young-Gi publicly gave Queen Young-Soo credit for all of Won-Ha's achievements, ensuring that the queen's legend would never fade, while Won-Ha was forgotten. Unable to bear the lie swallowed by her beloved people, Won-Ha grew ill and died. She passed on with no money, no clan, and no deeds credited to her name.": "随着时间的推移，寻求中饱私囊的商人开始侵吞政府资金。城市规划者加速了对森林的扩张，而没有考虑到可持续性，当地的贵族开始垄断繁荣的经济利益。每当Won-Ha提出抗议时，皇家顾问Young-Gi--Young-Soo王后的兄弟--就会驳回她的关切并破坏她的权威。最终，政治紧张局势使这位民间英雄变成了一个臭名昭著的人物。同时，英吉公开将元哈的所有成就归功于英秀王后，确保王后的传奇永不褪色，而元哈则被遗忘。由于无法忍受被她所爱的人吞下的谎言，元夏病倒了，死了。她去世时，没有钱，没有宗族，也没有事迹记在她的名下。",

Locals have had their memories altered as detailed in the \"{@area Gwishin of Dae Wong-Ha|1b1|x}\" section—but the characters aren't affected. Locals don't fixate on the characters' confusing questions or any strangeness affecting anyone nearby, as is local custom (see the \"{@area Yeonido Customs|1b4|x}\" section).

They are humble and shy but show their inner strength during crises. Thanks to their {@item ring of mind shielding}—a gift from their mother, who was also a magistrate—they have not been affected by Wong-Ha's curse, as the spirit can't telepathically alter Ahn-Jun's memories. Ahn-Jun treasures the ring and usually keeps it invisible—a property of the ring—while wearing it. The magistrate takes little solace in this protection, though, as they don't know what's befallen the city or why, and they fear the strangeness is all in their own mind.": "县长Kun Ahn-Jun（中性良好，人类（%0%））是延安市官僚机构中的一颗新星，尽管他们不苟言笑。他们谦虚而害羞，但在危机中显示出他们内在的力量。多亏了他们的{@item ring of mind shielding}--来自他们母亲的礼物，她也是一名法官--他们没有受到Wong-Ha的诅咒的影响，因为精神无法通过心灵感应改变Ahn-Jun的记忆。安俊很珍惜这枚戒指，在戴着它的时候，通常会让它隐身--这是戒指的特性。不过，地方官对这种保护并不感到欣慰，因为他们不知道这个城市遭遇了什么，也不知道为什么，他们担心这些奇怪的事情都是他们自己的想法。",

	"Talk of sabotage is Jung-Soon and her workers' way of explaining what's happening to them. The strangeness at the work site is a result of the memory-affecting fog and creatures under the control of Wong-Ha's gwishin.

Few others recognize the name, but Ahn-Jun does if asked (see the \"{@area Lingering Memories|1dd|x}\" section).

Alternatively, a character who succeeds on a DC 16 Charisma ({@skill Intimidation} or {@skill Persuasion}) check convinces the guards to let them see Young-Gi.": "前皇家顾问英吉最近很少呆在被称为龙座的大宫殿里，而是在他的小庄园的花园里享受退休生活，那里是凤凰区和海泰区的交界处。人物可能会从茶店的秦海那里了解到英吉的情况，或者通过与坤安君交谈。Young-Gi的庄园门口有四个{@creature Guard||guards}阻止陌生人未经邀请与贵族会面，但Ahn-Jun可以为角色提供信息，以赢得他们的会面。另外，一个角色如果在DC16的魅力（（%1%）或（%2%））检查中获得成功，就可以说服守卫让他们见英吉。",
	"When the guards admit the characters, they escort the characters to the estate's gardens. Read the following when the characters enter:": "当守卫接纳这些人物时，他们护送这些人物到庄园的花园。当人物进入时，请阅读以下内容。",
	"Trees hide the estate's walls from view, creating the illusion of being in a forest clearing. A pond dominates the center of the garden, with a pavilion overlooking the water. The place is a serene sanctuary, hidden from the clamor of the surrounding city.": "树木将庄园的墙壁隐藏起来，创造了一种在森林空地上的幻觉。一个池塘主导着花园的中心，有一个亭子俯瞰着水面。这个地方是一个宁静的避难所，隐藏在周围城市的喧嚣中。",
	"A few moments later, an elderly dragonborn man enters the garden. This is Young-Gi.": "过了一会儿，一个年长的龙裔男子进入花园。这就是英吉利。",
	"As the uncle of the current queen, Jin-Mi, and brother of the previous queen, Young-Soo, Young-Gi (neutral, dragonborn {@creature noble}) is accustomed to wealth and privilege. A life spent enjoying his status has made him charming and personable but also haughty. As he ages, however, he remembers the few true friends he once had and regrets how he treated Dae Won-Ha.": "作为现任王后Jin-Mi的叔叔和前任王后Young-Soo的哥哥，Young-Gi（中立，龙裔（%0%））习惯于财富和特权。一生都在享受他的地位，这使他变得有魅力、有个性，但也很傲慢。然而，随着年龄的增长，他想起了自己曾经有过的几个真正的朋友，并为自己对待大元帅的方式感到后悔。",
	"The elderly dragonborn's red scales aren't as lustrous as they once were, and he wears fine silk robes to compensate.": "老年龙族的红色鳞片不像以前那样有光泽了，他穿上了精致的丝绸长袍以示补偿。",
	"Young-Gi is also a victim of the gwishin's curse, so he doesn't recall the fog or the threats that appear within. But as he knew Dae Won-Ha and personally downplayed her achievements, he knows much about her past. He's not eager to reveal it, though.": "Young-Gi也是gwishin的诅咒的受害者，所以他不记得雾和里面出现的威胁。但由于他认识大元帅，并亲自淡化了她的成就，所以他对她的过去了解很多。不过，他并不急于透露。",
	"\"Thank you for speaking to me. I promise you my full attention.\"": "\"谢谢你对我说话。我向你保证我会全神贯注。\"",

	"\"Some members of my family waste their privilege and influence. I don't.\"": "\"我的一些家庭成员浪费他们的特权和影响。我没有。\"",
	"Young-Gi is calm and charismatic, and he listens intently when the characters speak. Because the elderly dragonborn is secure in his position, he isn't worried about the characters' visit. If they mention Dae Won-Ha, he's surprised and grows reflective. He shares his memories only if the characters present him with the lantern from Dae Won-Ha's forgotten memorial or her teacup, or if a character succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check. If convinced to speak about his old friend, he shares the following information:": "Young-Gi很平静，很有魅力，当人物说话时，他认真地听着。因为这位年长的龙裔在他的位置上是安全的，所以他并不担心这些人物的来访。如果他们提到大元帅，他就会感到惊讶并开始反思。只有当人物将大元帅被遗忘的纪念碑上的灯笼或她的茶杯交给他，或者人物在DC12魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查中成功时，他才会分享他的记忆。如果被说服谈论他的老朋友，他会分享以下信息。",
	"Dae Won-Ha was a brilliant magistrate and hero of the people. Much of the prosperity and equality Yeonido now enjoys is due to her work.": "Dae Won-Ha是一位杰出的地方官和人民的英雄。延安岛现在享有的繁荣和平等，很大程度上是由于她的工作。",

	"If Young-Gi is asked why Won-Ha was forgotten, he's reticent to answer. Through roleplaying or by succeeding on a DC 14 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check, a character can convince the noble to confess the following truths:": "如果英吉被问及元哈被遗忘的原因，他不愿意回答。通过角色扮演或在DC14魅力({@skill Persuasion})检查中获得成功，一个角色可以说服这位贵族承认以下事实。",
	"He was personally responsible for undermining Won-Ha's work and crediting her successes to his sister, Queen Young-Soo. He did this not out of malice, but out of devotion to his family and the crown, believing any individual who the people place above the ruling class must be treated as a threat.": "他亲自负责破坏元华的工作，并将她的成功归功于他的妹妹英秀皇后。他这样做并不是出于恶意，而是出于对家族和王室的忠诚，他认为任何被人民置于统治阶级之上的人都必须被视为一种威胁。",
	"He regrets what he did, but he has never worked up the courage to make amends to Won-Ha's spirit. He fears doing so will tarnish his sister's memory and, by extension, his niece's rule.": "他对自己的所作所为感到后悔，但他从未鼓起勇气向元华的精神作出补偿。他担心这样做会玷污他姐姐的记忆，进而玷污他侄女的统治。",
	"If the characters try to convince Young-Gi that something strange is happening in the city, he's not surprised. He doesn't recall the fog, but he's seen Won-Ha's gwishin several times at the royal park called the Park of the Elders, specifically late at night near the statue to his sister Young-Soo. Since Won-Ha had no surviving family members, he finds it conceivable that her gwishin could have lingered for years since her death, growing powerful enough to affect the city. Young-Gi has called on spirit arbiters to investigate the park in the past, but they found nothing.": "如果这些人物试图说服英吉，在这个城市发生了一些奇怪的事情，他并不感到惊讶。他不记得有雾，但他在名为长老公园的皇家公园里见过元华的观音好几次，特别是在深夜他姐姐英秀的雕像附近。由于元华没有幸存的家人，他认为她的鬼神可能在她死后徘徊了好几年，其力量增长到足以影响整个城市。Young-Gi过去曾召集精神仲裁者调查该公园，但他们什么也没发现。",
	"Young-Gi encourages the characters to seek out the spirit at the Park of the Elders around midnight. If they agree, he produces a tarnished gold amulet with Won-Ha's name etched on it. This was one of her symbols of office, a memento of their former friendship that he's kept for years. If brought near the {@area lantern from the Tiger District|1c8|x} or the {@area teacup from the Phoenix District|1cf|x}, the amulet faintly glows. If the amulet is brought before the gwishin of Dae Won-Ha in the Park of the Elders, the spirit might be convinced the people of Yeonido still remember her.": "英吉鼓励大家在午夜时分到长老公园去找那个灵魂。如果他们同意，他就会拿出一个变色的金符，上面刻着元华的名字。这是她的职务象征之一，是他们以前的友谊的纪念品，他已经保留了多年。如果被带到{@area lantern from the Tiger District|1c8|x}或{@area teacup from the Phoenix District|1cf|x}附近，护身符会发出微弱的光芒。如果把护身符带到长老公园的大元帅面前，鬼魂可能会相信延安岛的人们还记得她。",

	"Despite being driven by sorrow and rage, the gwishin of Dae Won-Ha is willing to speak to the characters. Her initial communication is limited to mournful statements like \"They've all forgotten me\" and \"I was nothing, I am nothing—soon they'll be nothing.\" To engage with Dae Won-Ha meaningfully, the characters must present evidence that people still remember her—particularly by showing her mementos from her life: the lantern from the Tiger District, the teacup from the Phoenix District, and the amulet Young-Gi kept safe.": "尽管被悲伤和愤怒所驱使，大元帅的桂欣还是愿意与人物交谈。她最初的交流仅限于哀伤的陈述，如 \"他们都忘了我 \"和 \"我过去什么都不是，我现在什么都不是--他们很快就会变成什么都不是\"。为了与大元帅进行有意义的交流，人物必须提出证据，证明人们仍然记得她--特别是通过向她展示她生前的纪念品：老虎区的灯笼、凤凰区的茶杯和英姬保管的护身符。",

If the characters succeed on this check, the gwishin makes them promise to spread the truth of her works and Young-Gi's role in hiding her successes across Yeonido. Should the characters do this, the gwishin finds peace, and neither she nor the fog returns. If they refuse or don't uphold their promise within a few weeks, her threat continues.": "角色可以通过出示三个纪念品中的任何一个，并在DC16魅力（（%0%）或（%1%））的检查中获得成功，来证明延安岛的人们仍然记得大元。如果人物出示两个纪念品，他们在这个检定上有优势。如果人物没有通过这个检查（或者还没有得到任何信物），鬼神就会攻击。如果检查成功，鬼神会让他们承诺将她的作品和英姬在整个延安岛隐藏成功的真相传播出去。如果这些人物做到了这一点，鬼神就会得到安宁，她和雾都不会回来。如果他们拒绝或在几周内不履行承诺，她的威胁就会继续。",
	"If the characters present three tokens, the gwishin marvels that she hasn't been forgotten and thanks the characters.

	"Once Dae Won-Ha's gwishin is reassured that she hasn't been forgotten, the memory-affecting fog ceases to appear and the curse afflicting the people of Yeonido ends, restoring their memories. The characters might have more work to do to finally lay the gwishin to rest, such as reminding the city of Dae Won-Ha's historic role in the city's ascent to prosperity. Kun Ahn-Jun can help the characters with this and suggests restoring the magistrate's shrine outside the city and circulating records of Won-Ha's works. Ahn-Jun might also arrange a meeting with Queen Jin-Mi, who supports restoring knowledge of Dae Won-Ha's deeds.": "一旦大元帅确信她没有被遗忘，影响记忆的雾气就会停止出现，折磨延岛人民的诅咒也会结束，恢复他们的记忆。这些人物可能还有更多的工作要做，以最终让鬼神安息，比如提醒城市的大元帅在城市的繁荣中扮演的历史角色。安俊（Kun Ahn-Jun）可以在这方面帮助人物，并建议在城外修复县长的祠堂，传播元哈的作品记录。Ahn-Jun还可以安排与支持恢复大元帅事迹的Jin-Mi女王会面。",

The Queen meets the characters, hailing them and Ahn-Jun as heroes and rewarding each party member with 500 gp rather than the 250 gp Ahn-Jun originally offered.": "一旦鬼神被平息，安俊就会让真美女王知道这些人物在拯救城市中的作用。女王接见了这些人物，称赞他们和安俊是英雄，并奖励每个党员500金币，而不是安俊最初提出的250金币。",
	"The people of Yeonido, the City of Judgment, pride themselves on upholding tradition. Thousands of years ago, the great dragon Mireu entrusted the founders of the city-state with a mandate to forge and lead a great civilization. Yeonido's people took the dragon's words to heart, establishing a reverence for fealty and order that has remained steadfast through the centuries. Two main beliefs form the foundation of Yeonido society: that structure is key to all things, and that adherence to familial duty trumps all but one's devotion to the royal family.": "审判之城Yeonido的人们以维护传统为荣。几千年前，伟大的龙Mireu委托这个城邦的创建者铸造和领导一个伟大的文明。延安岛的人民将龙的话语铭记于心，建立了对忠诚和秩序的敬畏，这种敬畏在几个世纪以来一直坚定不移。两个主要的信念构成了延安岛社会的基础：结构是所有事情的关键，以及对家庭责任的坚持胜过一切，但对王室的奉献除外。",
	"But those noble traditions have a troubling side: the disquieting ancestral spirits called gwishin that refuse to leave the world behind. When a citizen of Yeonido dies feeling wronged or knowing that they've harmed others, they return as one of these spirits. It's up to the spirit's family to resolve the injustice and bring peace to the gwishin, allowing it to move onward. If a gwishin is allowed to endure, it grows ever more dangerous.": "但这些高尚的传统也有令人不安的一面：被称为 \"鬼神 \"的令人不安的祖先灵魂拒绝离开这个世界。当一个延安岛的公民死后，觉得自己受了委屈，或者知道自己伤害了别人，他们就会作为这些灵魂之一回来。灵魂的家人有责任解决不公正的问题，给鬼神带来和平，让它继续前进。如果允许鬼神继续存在，它就会变得越来越危险。",
	"In recent years, some in Yeonido have begun to challenge the cultural reverence for ancient traditions, creating unease and discord. It may be no coincidence that gwishin are appearing more frequently than ever before, but it's unclear if more citizens are dying with unfinished business or if something more sinister is at work. Some even believe that the royal family has lost the trust of the great dragon Mireu. Everyone has an opinion, but no one knows how to restore harmony in Yeonido.": "近年来，延岛的一些人开始挑战对古老传统的文化敬畏，造成不安和不和谐。鬼神出现的频率比以往任何时候都高，这可能不是巧合，但目前还不清楚是否有更多的公民因未完成的事业而死亡，或者是否有更邪恶的东西在发挥作用。有些人甚至认为，皇室已经失去了大龙米雷的信任。每个人都有自己的看法，但没有人知道如何恢复延安岛的和谐。",
	"Those familiar with Yeonido typically know the following details:": "熟悉Yeonido的人通常知道以下细节。",
	"Yeonido is known for its citizens' familial loyalty and reverence for tradition, as well as for ancestral spirits called gwishin.": "延安岛以其公民的家庭忠诚和对传统的崇敬以及被称为 \"鬼神 \"的祖先精神而闻名。",
	"Humans and dragonborn are the most populous folk in Yeonido. Humans from Yeonido are primarily dark-haired and dark-eyed, and dragonborn have colorings based on their bloodlines, most commonly red or blue-green scales.": "人类和龙裔是延安岛人口最多的民族。延安岛的人类主要是黑发黑眼，而龙族则根据他们的血统拥有颜色，最常见的是红色或蓝绿色的鳞片。",

	"The city-state of Yeonido is nestled among fertile hills and deep forests. Though many dangerous beasts dwell in those lands, farming villages surround the walled city of Yeonido itself, supporting the city and benefiting from its protection.": "延安岛城邦坐落在肥沃的山丘和深邃的森林之间。虽然在这些土地上居住着许多危险的野兽，但农业村落围绕着有围墙的延安岛城本身，支持着城市并从其保护中受益。",
	"In the center of Yeonido stands the Seat of Dragons, the palace that houses the royal family and government. The outer palace walls are a brilliant red, and the drawbridge over the moat is always open to allow citizens to enter. Important ceremonies take place in the castle courtyard, where Queen Jin-Mi can often be seen greeting her people.": "在延安岛的中心，矗立着龙之座，那是容纳王室和政府的宫殿。宫殿的外墙是鲜艳的红色，护城河上的吊桥始终开放，允许市民进入。重要的仪式在城堡的院子里举行，在那里经常可以看到Jin-Mi女王向她的人民打招呼。",
	"Though the Seat of Dragons has no magical wards protecting it, gwishin never enter the palace grounds. Some speculate that this is because the Pearl of Mireu—a legendary gift the draconic founder of Yeonido granted to its people—is hidden somewhere in the palace.": "虽然龙之座没有魔法防护装置的保护，但鬼神从不进入宫殿的场地。有些人猜测这是因为米勒之珠--传说中延安岛的龙族创始人授予其人民的礼物--被藏在宫殿的某个地方。",
	"The Yu-Ik River flows just outside Yeonido's walls and is an essential part of the city. The riverbank holds a bright community of market stalls, colorful art, traders, peddlers, tinkers, and vendors of food and drink. On official holidays, people gather along the riverbank to tie ribbons on tree branches, play games along the shore, and celebrate with good food. However, these gatherings sometimes turn ugly, with fights breaking out due to muggings and territorial disputes arising among merchants. Cautious vendors often hire guards to protect them from trouble.": "裕益河就在延岛的城墙外流淌，是这座城市的重要组成部分。河岸上有一个明亮的社区，有市场摊位、多彩的艺术、商人、小贩、工匠以及食品和饮料的小贩。在正式的节日里，人们聚集在河岸边，在树枝上系上丝带，在岸边做游戏，并以美食来庆祝。然而，这些聚会有时会变得很难看，由于抢劫和商人之间产生的领土争端而发生争吵。谨慎的小贩们常常雇用警卫来保护他们免受麻烦。",
	"Not far from the city, this cursed temple sits on a cliff above a majestic waterfall. Foolhardy children dare each other to spend the night within the forbidding temple—a challenge that has sometimes proven fatal. The temple is brilliantly painted with a thousand colors and marked with hundreds of spiritual seals. Although the site is rumored to be filled with treasures, only the most reckless thieves consider breaking in, for countless gwishin rage there each night, their screams echoing for miles.": "在离城市不远的地方，这座被诅咒的寺庙坐落在一个雄伟的瀑布上方的悬崖上。胆大的孩子们敢于在这个禁忌的寺庙里过夜，这个挑战有时被证明是致命的。这座寺庙被涂上了一千种颜色，并有数百个精神印记。虽然传闻这里充满了宝藏，但只有最鲁莽的小偷才会考虑闯入，因为每晚都有无数的鬼神在这里发怒，他们的尖叫声回荡在数英里之外。",
	"The people of Yeonido are proud of their traditions and welcoming to those who respect their ways.": "延安岛人对自己的传统感到自豪，并欢迎那些尊重他们方式的人。",
	"Yeonido's residents believe in sacrifice for the good of the community. One must work selflessly, listen to one's elders, and act according to one's status for Yeonido to prosper. Structure is the central pillar of society. Class structure and family structure are key components of life within the city. Change is possible, but usually only when it's driven by members of the royal family or the noble clans. Queen Jin-Mi sits at the apex of the social order, followed by the noble elite, the various ranks of government magistrates, and the heads of each familial clan.": "延安岛的居民相信要为社区的利益做出牺牲。一个人必须无私地工作，听从长辈的意见，并根据自己的身份行事，才能使延安岛繁荣。结构是社会的核心支柱。阶级结构和家庭结构是城市中生活的关键组成部分。改变是可能的，但通常只有在皇室成员或贵族宗族的推动下才会发生。仁美王后坐在社会秩序的顶点，其次是贵族精英、各级政府官员和各家族宗族的首领。",
	"Clans live in compounds that often hold every member of the family, organized with its own hierarchy and led by a designated elder. But clans extend beyond families, often adopting outsiders who take up permanent residence in the city-state. When people meet, they exchange clan information before personal details, and the few folk in the city who have no clan—whether they were ejected from a clan or never adopted into one—are viewed with sympathy.": "氏族居住在通常容纳家庭每个成员的院落中，有自己的等级制度，并由指定的长老领导。但宗族的范围超出了家庭，经常收养在城邦中长期居住的外来者。当人们相遇时，他们会先交换宗族信息，然后再交换个人细节，而城市中少数没有宗族的人--无论他们是被宗族驱逐还是从未被收养，都会被同情地看待。",
	"When people marry—whether for love or for social or political reasons, both of which are considered equally valid—they must choose which partner's clan they will belong to after the union. In rare cases, a new couple decides to establish their own clan, though they often face judgment from their birth clans.": "当人们结婚时--无论是出于爱情还是社会或政治原因，这两种原因都被认为是同样有效的--他们必须选择在结合后属于哪个伴侣的氏族。在极少数情况下，一对新人决定建立自己的部族，尽管他们经常面临来自其出生部族的审判。",
	"The city-state of Yeonido is ruled by the beloved Queen Jin-Mi, a dragonborn said to be descended from the city's founder and first ruler, the dragon Mireu. The bureaucracy surrounding her consists of officials known as magistrates, who govern the city-state and enforce its laws. Those who aspire to become magistrates must undergo the exams—known collectively as the Test of Ascension—that take place each spring. These tests are notoriously difficult, and typically only those wealthy enough to afford time to study and special tutoring pass. Still, many less affluent but dedicated students have used this path to change their social status. Even non-citizens are allowed to take the test if they show proper respect for the process.": "延安岛城邦由受人爱戴的Jin-Mi女王统治，她是龙裔，据说是城市的创始人和第一任统治者--龙Mireu的后代。她身边的官僚机构由被称为地方官的官员组成，他们管理着这个城市国家并执行其法律。那些有志于成为治安官的人必须接受每年春天举行的统称为升天测试的考试。这些考试是出了名的难，通常只有那些足够富裕的人能够负担得起学习和特别辅导的时间，才能通过。然而，许多不那么富裕但有奉献精神的学生已经利用这一途径改变了他们的社会地位。甚至非公民也被允许参加考试，只要他们对考试过程表现出适当的尊重。",

	"If pressed, Awa can detail the creature that attacked him further (see the \"{@area Aurumvoraxes|245|x}\" section at the end of this adventure).

	"After Awa shares his experience, Uzoma tells the characters how King Diara has been pushing to increase output at the mine to please Empress Inaya, excavating newer tunnels so quickly there's not time to fully reinforce them. The Aurum Guild has been warning of the potential for collapses within the mine, but has been ignored.": "在阿瓦分享了他的经验之后，乌索玛告诉大家，迪亚拉国王为了取悦伊娜雅皇后，一直在推动提高矿场的产量，开凿新的隧道的速度非常快，没有时间去完全加固它们。曙光公会一直在警告矿区内有可能发生坍塌，但却被忽略了。",

	"Finding Kedjou requires the characters to spend an hour asking around Anisa Academy or to succeed on a DC 14 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check while engaging with academy faculty. They eventually learn that Kedjou has taken up offices on the top floor of the academy's library.": "找到Kedjou需要人物花一个小时在Anisa学院周围打听，或者在与学院教师接触时，通过DC14魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查成功。他们最终得知Kedjou在学院图书馆的顶层有办公室。",
	"When Simbon and the characters arrive at the library, a librarian ushers the group to Kedjou's private room on the library's top floor. Outside, two {@creature Guard||guards} stand alert.

The prince has offered Kedjou the position the priest seeks if he helps Kirina take the throne.": "Kedjou Kamal（中立邪恶，人类{@creature priest}）在无面先知的信徒（详见\"{@area Sensa Empire Gazetteer|235|x} \"部分）开办的孤儿院长大，长期以来一直觊觎着权力。作为大祭司，凯卓在打击圣徒的腐败指控方面做得很少--事实上，他是这些腐败的幕后推手。他一心一意地专注于为伊纳亚皇后的继承人争取一个顾问职位。这项任务使他与尼巴王子的基里纳达成了协议。王子向Kedjou提供了牧师寻求的职位，如果他帮助Kirina夺取王位的话。",
	"Kedjou expresses delight at seeing Prince Simbon and respectfully greets the characters. Characters who succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom ({@skill Insight}) check sense animosity toward Prince Simbon. In the course of the conversation, Kedjou discreetly mocks the prince, going so far as to sympathize with Simbon about how straining it must be to busy himself among the common rabble or visit a library.": "Kedjou在看到Simbon王子时表示很高兴，并恭敬地问候了这些人物。成功通过DC14智慧({@skill Insight})检查的人物会感觉到对辛邦王子的敌意。在谈话过程中，Kedjou谨慎地嘲笑王子，甚至同情Simbon，说他在普通的乌合之众中忙碌或访问图书馆是多么的辛苦。",
	"If told about the creatures in the mine, Kedjou believes the description matches that of monsters called aurumvoraxes, but he declares this is impossible as they're long extinct in the region. He can share the following details about the creatures:": "如果被告知矿井中的生物，凯卓认为其描述与称为aurumvoraxes的怪物相符，但他声明这是不可能的，因为它们在该地区早已灭绝。他可以分享关于这些生物的以下细节。",

	"If pressed to suggest what else might be in the mine, Kedjou flounders, then suggests it could be nothing more than overgrown rats.": "如果被问及矿井里还可能有什么东西，凯卓犹豫不决，然后表示这可能只不过是长满了老鼠。",
	"During the conversation with Kedjou, characters who have proficiency in the {@skill Arcana} or {@skill Religion} skill catch sight of interesting details in the notes spread around the room. The notes suggest Kedjou is researching a unique conjuration spell. A character can steal a page from the notes by succeeding on a DC 12 Dexterity ({@skill Sleight of Hand}) check. If they fail, the character still pockets the page but draws Kedjou's attention. The priest curtly declares he needs to get back to his studies and dismisses the group.": "在与Kedjou的对话中，精通{@skill Arcana}或{@skill Religion}技能的人物看到了房间里散布的笔记中有趣的细节。这些笔记表明Kedjou正在研究一种独特的魔法。一个角色可以通过DC12的灵巧（（%2%））检查成功从笔记中偷出一页。如果他们失败了，这个人物仍然可以把这页纸收入囊中，但会引起凯卓的注意。牧师礼貌地宣布他需要回到他的研究中去，并遣散了这群人。",
	"Any character who later spends at least 15 minutes investigating Kedjou's notes can make a DC 14 Intelligence ({@skill Arcana} or {@skill Religion}) check. If the check succeeds, the character realizes the priest is investigating how to summon powerful creatures and cause them to linger for longer than usual.": "任何角色如果后来花了至少15分钟调查凯卓的笔记，可以进行DC14智力（（%0%）或（%1%））检查。如果检定成功，该角色就会意识到牧师正在调查如何召唤强大的生物，并使它们比平时逗留更长时间。",
	"Characters might challenge Kedjou on his animosity toward Prince Simbon or question whether the priest's research is related to the giant scorpions appearing in the city. Kedjou initially denies any such suggestions, but a successful DC 14 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check or suitable roleplaying convinces Kedjou to admit he dislikes Simbon. He believes that if Simbon wins the empress's favor and is named heir, it will be because of Anisa's wealth, not because Simbon deserves the position.": "角色可能会质疑Kedjou对Simbon王子的敌意，或者质疑牧师的研究是否与城市中出现的巨型蝎子有关。Kedjou最初否认任何这样的建议，但如果成功通过DC14魅力（{@skill Persuasion}）检查或适当的角色扮演，Kedjou就会承认他不喜欢Simbon。他认为，如果辛邦赢得皇后的青睐并被指定为继承人，那是因为阿尼萨的财富，而不是因为辛邦值得这个位置。",
	"Despite this being said to his face, Simbon chuckles awkwardly and doesn't defend himself except to say that everyone's entitled to their opinion. Kedjou requests the characters leave soon after.": "尽管这话是当着他的面说的，辛本尴尬地笑了笑，没有为自己辩护，只是说每个人都有权发表自己的意见。Kedjou要求这些人物很快离开。",

	"After leaving the library, if a character asks Simbon about Kedjou's insults or assessments of his leadership potential, the prince tries to shrug it off. He also doesn't think much of his future as a leader. Through roleplaying or by succeeding on a DC 14 Charisma ({@skill Persuasion}) check, a character can encourage Simbon to take his role as someone the people look up to more seriously. Doing so earns the characters Simbon's respect and influences the prince's willingness to speak out later in the adventure (see the \"{@area Beyond the Gold Warren|230|x}\" section).": "离开图书馆后，如果有人物问辛邦关于凯卓的侮辱或对他的领导潜力的评估，王子就会试图甩开它。他也不怎么看重自己作为领导者的未来。通过角色扮演或在DC14魅力（（%0%））检查中获得成功，一个角色可以鼓励辛邦把他作为人们所仰望的人的角色看得更认真。这样做可以赢得辛邦的尊重，并影响到王子在冒险过程中的发言意愿（见\"{@area Beyond the Gold Warren|230|x} \"部分）。",
	"Whatever the outcome of the encounter with Kedjou, Prince Simbon suggests the group head to the Goldwarren, which lies a few hours north of Anisa.

He also hates the idea of Kirina starting the search effort without him.": "无论与凯卓相遇的结果如何，辛本王子建议大家前往位于阿尼萨以北几小时的金瓦伦。他并不喜欢冒险进入隧道的想法，但他真的想帮助那些被困在里面的人。他也讨厌基里纳在没有他的情况下开始搜寻工作的想法。",
	"Unless the characters have other pressing business in the city, Simbon calls for a coach to convey them there. He opposes any talk of breaking into Kedjou's quarters or harming the high priest, both of which would be scandals for Simbon's family.": "除非这些人物在城里有其他紧迫的事情，否则辛本会叫一辆马车把他们送过去。他反对任何关于闯入凯卓的住所或伤害大祭司的言论，这两件事对辛邦的家庭来说都是丑闻。",
	"The Goldwarren's main entrance is wide enough for two carriages to drive through side by side; the mine then branches into a labyrinth of tunnels.

Its three principal city-states—Anisa, Niba, and Tarikh—were each built around gold mines, and as their wealth has grown, so has their population, influence, and foreign trade.

The people value education highly, and the city is home to Anisa Academy, the only university in the empire. Politically, the city has enjoyed years of peace under King Diara's rule, but many dread his inevitable retirement.

Tarikh also hosts the Seven Stairs, the headquarters of the Acolytes of the Faceless Prophet.": "塔里克城邦位于森萨的西北部，依偎在锯齿状的山峰上。其年轻的统治者，国王Sundasha，平衡了商业需求和当地环境，因为该城市分散的绿洲为其提供了该地区唯一的一些可耕地。虽然这些土地大部分为帝国的人民提供了食物，但也有相当一部分被用来为该城市珍贵的骆驼群种植饲料。塔里克还拥有七级台阶，是无面先知的圣徒们的总部。",

A site of ritual pilgrimage and worship, the tomb is a large golden dome without an entrance that holds the Prophet's bones.
