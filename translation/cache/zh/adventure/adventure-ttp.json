	"The Snout of Omgar is a geographical region {@adventure described briefly|ToA|2|Snout of Omgar} in {@adventure Tomb of Annihilation|ToA}. Not much is revealed about the location or its inhabitants in that adventure, however. The Tortle Package is written for Dungeon Masters who want to know more about the Snout of Omgar.

	"Tortles are intelligent, turtle-like humanoids that have a knack for wilderness survival. The race first appeared in early editions of the D&D game, nowhere more prominently than in module X9, The Savage Coast, which was set in the world of Mystara. Tortles, like most other adventurous races, can appear on any D&D world. In the Forgotten Realms, the {@adventure peninsula of Chult|ToA|2} and the Snout of Omgar make good homes for them.": "龟甲人是一种聪明的、类似乌龟的人形生物，有在野外生存的本领。该种族首次出现在D&D游戏的早期版本中，其中最突出的是X9模块 \"野蛮海岸\"，该模块设定在Mystara世界。托尔人，像其他大多数冒险种族一样，可以出现在任何D&D世界。在被遗忘的世界里，{@adventure peninsula of Chult|ToA|2}和奥格尔的鼻孔是它们的好家。",

	"The Snout of Omgar was once a peninsula, but upheaval wrought by the Spellplague broke off the tip of the peninsula, creating an island separated from mainland Chult by a narrow strait. When the separation occurred, tortles living in the vicinity claimed the island as their domain. The strait provided a natural defense against aggressive mainland predators.": "奥格尔之鼻曾经是一个半岛，但咒语瘟疫造成的动荡使半岛的顶端断裂，形成了一个与丘特大陆隔着一条狭窄海峡的岛屿。当分离发生时，生活在附近的托尔人声称该岛是他们的领地。海峡提供了一个天然的防御手段，以抵御大陆上的侵略性掠食者。",
	"The tortles of the Snout are hospitable folk who like to hunt, catch fish, build things, and trade with visitors. Not long after the island was formed, a pirate ship captained by a cleric of the sea goddess {@deity Umberlee|Faerûnian|SCAG} was caught in a typhoon and swept ashore. Tortles rescued the shipwrecked survivors and looked after them. The captain impressed the tortles with her magic and told stories that painted {@deity Umberlee|Faerûnian|SCAG} in a flattering light. In time, she persuaded them to raise a palace in her deity's honor. The cleric chose a mountainside overlooking the sea, and there the tortles spent a decade building {@adventure Dangwaru, the Typhoon Palace|ttp|3|Dangwaru (The Typhoon Palace)}, which secretly served as a temple of {@deity Umberlee|Faerûnian|SCAG}. In return, the cleric and her followers left the tortles alone and were quiet neighbors.": "斯诺特岛的托尔人是好客的人，他们喜欢打猎、捕鱼、建造东西，并与游客交易。在该岛形成后不久，一艘由海神（%0%）的教士领导的海盗船被台风卷入，并被冲上岸。Tortles救起了遇难的幸存者并照顾他们。船长用她的魔法给托尔人留下了深刻的印象，她讲的故事让{@deity Umberlee|Faerûnian|SCAG}的人觉得很有面子。后来，她说服他们为她的神灵建造一座宫殿。教士选择了一个可以俯瞰大海的山坡，在那里，托尔人花了十年时间建造了{@adventure Dangwaru, the Typhoon Palace|ttp|3|Dangwaru (The Typhoon Palace)}，秘密地作为{@deity Umberlee|Faerûnian|SCAG}的神庙。作为回报，教士和她的追随者们对托特尔人不闻不问，做个安静的邻居。",
	"Over time, the island's {@deity Umberlee|Faerûnian|SCAG} worshipers died off, and the palace fell into ruin. Descendants of the tortles who built the {@adventure Typhoon Palace|ttp|3|Dangwaru (The Typhoon Palace)} soon discovered evil creatures lurking within. Older tortles wisely shun the ruined palace, but younger tortles occasionally try to explore it as a rite of passage. Few of them get far before strange monsters frighten them away.": "随着时间的推移，岛上的{@deity Umberlee|Faerûnian|SCAG}崇拜者逐渐死去，宫殿也陷入废墟。建造{@adventure Typhoon Palace|ttp|3|Dangwaru (The Typhoon Palace)}的托尔人的后代很快发现里面潜伏着邪恶的生物。年长的托特人明智地避开了废墟宫殿，但年轻的托特人偶尔会尝试探索它，作为一种成年仪式。他们中很少有人走远了，就被奇怪的怪物吓跑了。",
