						"När du läser det här har du säkert hört talas om den kommande publiceringen av Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica, som jag privat kallar \"Plane Shift\": Ravnica\". Den boken är den främsta anledningen till att denna del av Plane Shift-serien är relativt sen, eftersom D&D-delen av min hjärna var upptagen med att arbeta med den. Men den boken är också kulmen på allt arbete som jag har gjort med den här serien under de senaste åren. Plane Shift - och er överväldigande positiva respons på den - banade väg för Ravnica-boken i hårdvara, genom att bevisa att en crossover mellan D&D och magi var något som folk ville se. Så er glädje och entusiasm för detta husdjursprojekt är direkt ansvarig för att Guildmaster's Guide to Ravnica kommer senare i år. Tack! När jag började arbeta i D&D-teamet på Wizards of the Coast år 2000 fanns det redan ett visst tal om att göra en crossover-produkt mellan D&D och Magic: The Gathering. På den tiden var Magic mer eller mindre synonymt med Dominaria-världen. Så på sätt och vis är den här delen av serien Plane Shift över arton år gammal. Det här arbetet är naturligtvis inte heltäckande. Som alltid är The Art of Magic: The Gathering-Dominaria den definitiva resursen, men även den boken kunde bara skrapa på ytan av Dominaria. Konstboken byggde på världsguiden, och världsguiden valde specifikt tio regioner i världen - två per manafärg - som fokus för kortuppsättningen. Av dessa tio regioner ligger sju antingen på eller runt kontinenten Aerona eller har en betydande inverkan på den. Av den anledningen tog jag beslutet att i den här artikeln fokusera på domänerna och utelämna regionerna Urborg, Shiv och Yavimaya. Jag tänkte att om jag utelämnade dessa skulle det minska frestelsen för karaktärerna att åka runt en jordklot som innehåller så många regioner som redan utelämnats från konstboken. Med detta sagt innehåller konstboken en komplett karta och på Internet finns det rikligt med information om Dominaria (särskilt på {@link the Magic Website|https://magic.wizards.com/en}). Så om du vill utvidga din kampanj bortom Aerona bör du inte ha några problem att göra det. Det finns inte mycket regelinnehåll i den här artikeln, till stor del på grund av att Dominaria är så nära som Magic kommer den klassiska fantasy som D&D hämtar sin inspiration från. Använd gärna klassalternativ, monster och andra delar av den femte upplagans D&D-regler (vilket du kan {@link find here|https://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules}). Ännu en gång, tack för att ni visat så mycket stöd för serien Plane Shift, och för att ni möjliggör de ännu mer spännande projekten som kommer att komma!"

Den sprider sig längs den västra kusten och ut till de närliggande öarna, inklusive Isle of Avenant i norr och stora delar av Spice Isles i väster. Även om Benalias land är mest känt för sina bördiga fält, omfattar Benalias land även gamla skogar, böljande berg och en lång kustlinje.",

Genom en informell men ofta upprepad överenskommelse håller sig benaliska fartyg borta från Vodahavet, och sjöfolket i {@b Vodalia} låter sjöfarten passera längs Aeronas kustlinjer i stort sett obehindrat. Denna kontroll över Aeronas södra kuster gör det möjligt för Benalish att upprätthålla en permanent närvaro i Sursi på kontinentens östkust.",

Den norra grenen blir de formidabla topparna i Hurloonbergen, hemvist för en fredlig men tillbakadragen nation av minotaurer.
