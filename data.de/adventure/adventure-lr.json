Sie können dieses Abenteuer mit bis zu drei oder sechs Spielern spielen.

Der mürrische und griesgrämige Gar wurde zum Propheten von Olhydra, der Elementarprinzessin des bösen Wassers, und zum Anführer des Kults der Zermalmenden Welle. Er war verbittert durch ein Leben voller Leid durch die Hand anderer: Piraten töteten seine Familie, als er noch jung war, er wurde zur Knechtschaft an Bord eines Handelsschiffes gezwungen, und dann ließ ihn eine andere Piratenbande zum Sterben auf offener See zurück, wo er seinen Arm durch einen Hai verlor. Gar sah die elementare Kraft des Wassers als das einzig Wertvolle in seinem Leben an und versammelte andere, denen es ähnlich ging.",

Als Anführer von Olhydras Kult konnte er ihre angeborene Magie kanalisieren, was bei den anderen Kultisten der Zerschmetternden Welle Ehrfurcht und Furcht auslöste.",

								"Auf der Elementarebene des Wassers wütete Gar aus Protest. Drown war gebrochen worden, und der Kult der Zerschmetternden Welle war zerbrochen. Er stellte sich Olhydras Unmut und erwartete, von ihrem Zorn vernichtet zu werden, und war erstaunt, als er einige Jahre später vor der Küste von Turmish im Meer der Gefallenen Sterne treibend erwachte. In einer Hand hielt er einen Dreizack, obwohl es nicht Drown war.",
								"Gar fand heraus, dass die uralte Waffe ihm von der Meeresgöttin Umberlee geschenkt worden war, der es in Verbindung mit Olhydra gelang, den Propheten mit einer noch gewaltigeren Macht auszustatten, als er sie zuvor besaß. Die Meere und die Stürme, die über ihm tobten, gehorchten nun seinen Befehlen, und frei von der ursprünglichen Abmachung mit den anderen Propheten konnte Gar unbelastet von allen vergangenen Verpflichtungen nach Erfolg streben.",

Dort öffnete er einen Spalt, nutzte dessen Kraft und schuf einen Ort, an dem Schiffe zerstört und unter die Wellen gezogen wurden.",
