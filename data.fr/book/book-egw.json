								"L'imagination est le moteur de l'innovation et inspire la création commune. Pour cet enfant de théâtre un peu geek, l'imagination était ma consolation.",
								"Depuis que ma grand-mère a commencé à me lire des livres pour m'endormir avec {@i The Lord of the Rings} et Piers Anthony à l'âge de sept ans, je me suis retrouvé à la fois perdu dans l'imagination et renforcé par elle. Depuis que je jouais à faire semblant avec mon frère dans notre jardin pluvieux de Floride, jusqu'à ce que je passe en revue tous les RPG de jeux vidéo, je me suis sentie attirée par les histoires, surtout celles que je pouvais façonner avec mes amis. Ce n'est que lorsque l'on m'a présenté {@i Dungeons & Dragons} pendant ma première année de lycée que j'ai trouvé une expérience qui réunissait tout ce que j'aimais dans la narration, la collaboration, le théâtre et la créativité. J'ai commencé à construire des mondes dans lesquels mes amis pouvaient jouer et à remplir des cahiers d'idées étranges, de PNJ excentriques et de fils d'histoires médiocres (hé, tout le monde doit bien commencer quelque part). J'avais trouvé mon passe-temps favori, celui qui continue à m'élever et à façonner qui je suis aujourd'hui.",
								"Toutes ces années plus tard, par un concours de circonstances magique, un groupe d'amis joueurs et moi-même avons commencé à diffuser notre jeu de D&D sur Internet sous le nom de {@i Critical Role}, nous attendant à peu ou pas d'intérêt après avoir passé près d'une décennie dans les médias Internet à nous entendre dire que tout ce qui dépasse cinq minutes n'a que peu de valeur pour la \"génération ADHD\". Ces mythes se sont rapidement révélés faux, et notre jeu personnel s'est transformé en une communauté, puis en un phénomène inattendu qui est devenu quelque chose de profondément merveilleux et important pour moi et, semble-t-il, pour beaucoup d'autres personnes dans le monde.",
								"C'est à travers la campagne originale qui suivait les exploits du groupe d'aventuriers Vox Machina, dont je dirigeais la narration en tant que maître de donjon, que j'ai commencé à créer le continent de Tal'Dorei et le monde d'Exandria pour que mes amis puissent l'explorer. En élargissant ce monde avec chaque aventure héroïque de mes amis, chaque facette unique de l'histoire de leurs personnages enrichissant ce royaume qui, autrement, n'existait que dans ma tête, Exandria a commencé à grandir et à mûrir, donnant parfois l'impression de prendre une vie propre. À la fin de ce voyage, alors que les héros de Vox Machina achevaient leur histoire majestueuse, nous savions tous que nous avions créé quelque chose de spécial. Cependant, ce n'était que la première des nombreuses histoires que nous voulions tisser.",
								"Une deuxième campagne a commencé peu de temps après, cette fois sur le continent voisin de Wildemount, une terre marquée par une histoire sombre, des luttes politiques et de dangereux secrets qui couvent sous la surface de la vie quotidienne. Connaissant maintenant la complexité avec laquelle mes joueurs étaient prêts à s'engager, j'ai développé Wildemount à une échelle et à un niveau de complexité que je n'avais jamais tentés auparavant. C'est avec enthousiasme que j'ai vu cette région d'Exandria prendre forme, et c'est là que les Mighty Nein (comme on les a appelés) ont commencé leurs aventures, qui se poursuivent encore aujourd'hui, au moment où j'écris cet avant-propos. Wildemount s'est développé pour devenir un cadre vaste, complexe et charmant dont je suis de plus en plus fier. Puis l'incroyable opportunité s'est présentée de collaborer avec Wizards of the Coast pour vous apporter ce cadre sous forme imprimée.",
								"Je n'ai été rien de moins qu'humble et extatique devant cette chance de faire partie de quelque chose de si important pour moi. Ce fut un grand honneur d'amener notre monde dans le multivers de D&D et de vous inviter à venir y jouer et y créer. Exandria continue d'être l'une de mes réalisations les plus fières, Wildemount étant l'aspect le plus abouti de ce monde à ce jour. Ce continent est riche en aventures et en mystères. Travailler avec des personnes aussi talentueuses pour faire de cette campagne une réalité est une joie que je n'aurais jamais cru pouvoir éprouver un jour. Wildemount a commencé avec {@i Critical Role}, mais ce livre est une invitation pour vous et vos amis à faire de ce monde le vôtre.",
								"Je vous invite tous à venir à Wildemount. Parcourez les dangereuses vallées de l'ouest de Wynandir, naviguez le long de la côte de la Ménagerie, bravez les terres meurtries de Xhorhas et explorez les anciens secrets des régions situées au-delà de ces royaumes ravagés par la guerre. Suivez les chemins des puissants Nein ou tracez votre propre voie. C'est votre Wildemount maintenant.",

Vous trouverez également de tout nouveaux monstres et des aventures d'introduction qui pourront vous aider à démarrer une campagne dans l'une des quatre régions de Wildemount.",

Vous pouvez utiliser le système de chroniques héroïques pour créer une histoire de fond qui enracine fermement votre personnage dans les terres de Wildemount.

								"Il y a longtemps, ce monde n'était que forces tumultueuses et chaotiques, feux incontrôlés et roches déchiquetées. A travers les cieux cendrés de la Création Primordiale, les dieux sont venus d'au-delà de l'éther, nouveaux et sans forme. En regardant ce royaume agité, ils ont vu le potentiel d'une grande beauté, d'une grande force, et la chance d'apprendre leur propre place dans la création.",
								"Ainsi, les mains divines donnèrent naissance aux Premiers Enfants, les elfes, qui incarnaient la beauté et la grâce, pour marcher sur le Vert verdoyant et connaître la musique du Bleu. Une deuxième création a vu le jour : les nains, un peuple courageux décidé à apprivoiser la terre, rempli de l'art et de l'invention de la divinité au-delà du vide cendré. La vie fut donnée à un troisième peuple : les humains, dotés de cœurs passionnés qui brûlaient aussi bien que leur vie était courte, et imprégnés du besoin de célébrer et de rire.",
								"D'autres créations suivirent, tandis que les nombreuses races d'Exandria prenaient forme grâce à l'inspiration illimitée des dieux protéiformes. Ces enfants de la création marchaient sur la terre et, au fur et à mesure que leurs connaissances augmentaient, ils tentaient de la construire. Mais la terre était féroce et perfide, et les enfants furent écrasés sur les rochers et consumés par les éléments. Le chagrin remplit le cœur des dieux tandis que ces premières races luttaient contre une terre qui ne voulait pas d'elles, et les enfants se tournèrent vers leurs créateurs pour être guidés et protégés. Ainsi, les dieux leur firent des cadeaux, prêtant leur propre pouvoir à leurs enfants pour qu'ils créent et façonnent le monde qui les entoure ; ce furent les premières magies divines.",
								"Grâce à ces magies, les différents peuples ont appris à plier la terre en colère à leur volonté : tempérer les flammes qui jaillissent du sol, dompter les inondations qui menaçaient leur abondance, et transformer les semis en fruits et les bêtes en repas. Le langage s'est banalisé, la culture est née et la gouvernance a remplacé l'anarchie. Les créateurs protéiformes, la divinité au-delà des cieux cendrés, virent le progrès et virent qu'il était bon, mais fragile et qu'il avait besoin de gardiens.",
								"Ainsi naquirent les Premiers Protecteurs : les Dragons Métalliques d'Exandria, qui protégèrent les races les plus douces. Le royaume devint plus calme, les gens se multiplièrent, et de nouveaux êtres prirent forme et vie. Au fur et à mesure que la culture se développait et que les gens comprenaient mieux le monde qui les entourait, ils se tournaient également vers leurs créateurs et leur rendaient hommage, leur donnaient une forme, un titre et un but.",
								"Mais ce royaume ne voulait pas être apprivoisé. Les falaises tremblantes ont rugi en signe de défi. Les mers se sont gonflées et englouties. Des flammes ont jailli de la terre. Sous les éléments, inconnus des Créateurs au-delà des cieux cendrés, vivaient des êtres anciens qui avaient déjà fait de ce monde leur maison : les Primordiaux. Ces grands titans élémentaires, qui vivaient autrefois au plus profond du monde, s'élevèrent de leur domaine invisible pour détruire la terre une fois de plus. Les dieux ont vu leurs enfants, leur joie, être projetés contre les rochers brisés ou donnés en pâture à des terreurs sans forme déchaînées par la destruction. Des entités démoniaques jaillirent de l'ombre des abysses pour se régaler du carnage, appelées par la violence et libérées pour nettoyer la charogne.",
								"Certains dieux étaient tellement remplis de chagrin et de colère qu'ils souhaitaient quitter ce monde et repartir à zéro. Ils tentèrent de convaincre leurs semblables divins de se joindre aux Primordiaux, permettant ainsi au chaos de reprendre possession du royaume. D'autres dieux souhaitaient rester et soumettre les Primordiaux, afin de dompter la terre pour le bien de leurs créations. Ainsi fut créée une division entre les dieux. Les sentinelles célestes, autrefois dédiées à la lutte contre les forces chaotiques de l'Abîme, se laissèrent aller à la haine et à la tyrannie, forgeant de nouveaux enfers sous la direction d'un ange déchu qui revendiquait la seigneurie de tous les royaumes de soufre et de soufre.",
								"Les Créateurs restants, qui souhaitaient sauver leur foyer, leurs créations et leur identité, ont été contraints de prendre les armes et d'apprendre à protéger ce qu'ils appréciaient le plus. Ils organisèrent leurs adeptes et leur apprirent à puiser eux-mêmes dans les pouvoirs de la création : construire, modifier et détruire, le tout sans l'aide de la puissance divine. Les mortels ont appris à se défendre grâce à des pratiques telles que l'alchimie ou en tordant les tissus mêmes de l'existence, mais à une échelle moindre que celle de leurs créateurs.",
								"Ce don était la connaissance de la magie des arcanes, que les bons enfants utilisèrent pour chasser les traîtres de leur famille, bannir les Créateurs transformés dans leurs propres plans carcéraux et finalement détruire les Primordiaux, dispersant les éléments chaotiques dans leurs propres plans d'existence. Le monde était en paix pour la première fois depuis sa création, et la première véritable civilisation a pris racine et s'est développée en une grande ville appelée Vasselheim. Le berceau de la création. La cité de l'aube.",

								"Avec le temps, certains habitants d'Exandria sont devenus arrogants. Voyant dans leurs dons arcaniques la preuve que les dieux n'avaient pas d'emprise sur leur destin, ils ont commencé à croire qu'avec suffisamment de connaissances, ils pouvaient eux aussi devenir aussi puissants que les dieux. Beaucoup ont commencé à fuir la foi en faveur de leurs propres objectifs. Bien que cela ait blessé et surpris les Créateurs, ils ont compris la volonté de leurs enfants et ont enduré par amour et espoir de rédemption.",
								"De grands royaumes ont vu le jour en Exandrie. Des châteaux furent construits en un jour, accélérés par le nouveau pouvoir des arcanistes. Des cités érudites planaient et dérivaient dans les cieux, se déplaçant sous la direction de mages érudits là où leurs intérêts les menaient. Même si la magie pouvait être utilisée pour accomplir les tâches les plus difficiles avec une rapidité inconnue jusqu'alors, les utilisateurs de la magie s'efforçaient toujours d'innover. En pratiquant et en perfectionnant leurs pouvoirs de création, les mages ont bientôt percé les secrets de la vie elle-même, donnant naissance à de nouvelles créatures et de nouveaux pouvoirs merveilleux et dangereux. De puissants archimages tels que Vecna le Chuchoteur et Halas Lutagran ont commencé à tracer leur chemin dans l'histoire au cours de cette ère d'expérimentation magique débridée.",
								"L'avènement de l'arcane semblait être la clé d'une ère d'abondance, mais s'avéra également la menacer, car la prospérité fit bientôt place à la cupidité. Des querelles mesquines ont éclaté pour les ressources et les richesses parmi l'élite, tandis que la rumeur de l'immortalité grâce à un arcane perfectionné a commencé à rendre les plus grands mages fous d'une soif de pouvoir sans fin. Un mage mortel, dont le nom a été perdu ou rayé de l'histoire, a élaboré des rites désormais interdits pour défier le dieu de la mort, le terrassant et prenant sa place au panthéon, faisant d'elle la première et la seule mortelle à accéder à la divinité. L'archimage Vespin Chloras a été inspiré par cette démonstration. Poussé par sa faim, il a cherché à obtenir les conseils et le pouvoir des dieux bannis, ouvrant les portes de leurs prisons et libérant les traîtres dans le monde des mortels.",
								"Pendant leur emprisonnement, ces dieux de la haine et du désespoir tordirent leur prison à leur propre image, engendrant des horreurs impensables qui ne vivaient que pour transformer la paix en souffrance, et la droiture en arrogance et en avidité. Les neuf enfers et les abysses commencèrent à se frayer un chemin dans la création. Les dieux traîtres et leurs enfants haineux découvrirent un monde vierge, à l'exception de l'avarice des mortels. L'envie de détruire fut remplacée par le désir de dominer, et les Dieux Betrayer commencèrent par se retourner contre le mage qui les avait libérés, faisant de l'Archimage Vespin leur premier esclave. Cette divinité corrompue rechercha les restes de leur progéniture, dispersés à travers le monde, et créa un nouveau royaume puissant et terrible dans les plaines de Xhorhas, à l'extrémité du monde de Vasselheim-Ghor Dranas.",
								"Dans cette terre du mal, où le pouvoir tordu des plans inférieurs s'est infiltré en Exandria, les seigneurs des ténèbres ont souillé l'esprit des mortels, accueillant avec avidité ceux qui avaient perdu leur chemin et offrant de grandes promesses et des bienfaits aux cœurs facilement influençables. Ces graines empoisonnées ont trouvé un terrain fertile dans le cœur des mortels obsédés par le pouvoir illimité de l'arcane. Avec une légion de damnés derrière eux, les Dieux Betrayer firent bientôt connaître leur présence au monde par un assaut sur Vasselheim même.",
								"Bien qu'une grande partie de la ville ait été réduite en ruines, Vasselheim a résisté à l'assaut initial, sauvée par l'intervention des divinités premières elles-mêmes, qui sont descendues pour échanger des coups avec leurs anciens frères. La bataille entre divinités et mortels, entre héros et démons, fit rage sans relâche pendant vingt jours et vingt nuits, jusqu'à ce que les forces obscures, dont l'attaque surprise avait été déjouée, soient finalement contraintes de battre en retraite.",
								"Le mal fut repoussé momentanément, mais avec la révélation d'un ennemi aussi terrible, une dangereuse course aux armements arcaniques commença. La confiance fut indéfiniment brisée : si les mortels pouvaient tomber sous l'emprise des Dieux Traîtres, qui était un allié ? Si une telle ruine pouvait être déclenchée sous l'œil vigilant des dieux, en quoi étaient-ils utiles ? Ne faisant confiance à personne d'autre qu'à eux-mêmes, les humains égoïstes et singuliers ont reforgé leurs instruments de célébration pour en faire des instruments d'une puissance incroyable - des artefacts qui pourraient être maniés par des héros dignes de ce nom. La fascination des nains pour la roche et la terre s'est transformée en isolement lorsqu'ils se sont enfoncés dans les montagnes, utilisant leurs dons divins pour animer des légions de golems autonomes afin de protéger leurs salles ancestrales. Les elfes ont utilisé leur compréhension de la beauté et des complexités de la création pour tisser des sorts d'une force destructrice inimaginable, comme Exandria n'en avait jamais vu auparavant.",
								"Pour la première fois depuis la destruction des Primordiaux, la magie s'est concentrée sur la guerre.

Divisés par les pics Ashkeeper, les champs de Wynandir abritaient autrefois plusieurs puissantes maisons régnantes, qui se disputaient leurs propres objectifs avant d'être entraînées dans l'un ou l'autre camp du conflit des dieux, ou de s'abstenir pour leurs propres raisons. L'immensité du pouvoir exercé par les divinités premières et les dieux traîtres a suffi à blesser le paysage pendant des éons, et l'utilisation irresponsable des connaissances arcaniques développées par les mortels a assuré la ruine de leur propre héritage.",
								"Il reste peu de traces de cette terrible guerre, mais ses effets se font encore sentir aujourd'hui. L'ampleur des énergies libérées par les dieux et les mortels dans les batailles qui ont suivi a suffi à effacer les frontières qui retenaient le chaos élémentaire, répandant une destruction effrénée dans le monde. Cela a complètement réarrangé le flux connu de l'énergie magique ley à travers Exandria. Le sombre royaume de Ghor Dranas fut réduit en cendres, mais le conflit dévasta les peuples d'Exandria, rasant des villes entières et inspirant à beaucoup le désir de fuir entièrement ce plan d'existence. Les pertes en vies humaines ont été si importantes que les historiens pensent que pas plus d'un tiers de la population d'Exandria a survécu, ne laissant qu'un seul bastion de civilisation : la Cité de l'Aube, Vasselheim.",
								"Le monde est entré dans une longue et sombre période de repousse. Les Dieux Betrayer furent bannis une fois de plus dans leurs royaumes de tromperie et de haine, mais la menace de leur retour pesait lourdement sur le monde. Les Déités Principales pensaient que leur implication dans les conflits mortels était à blâmer pour les dommages cataclysmiques infligés à Exandria. Elles savaient que tant que les portes divines resteraient ouvertes, les plans de prison qui retenaient les Traîtres bannis resteraient imparfaits et temporaires.",
								"Ainsi, espérant s'assurer qu'une telle ruine ne s'abattrait plus sur Exandria, ils laissèrent leurs enfants se débrouiller seuls. Les Créateurs retournèrent dans leurs propres royaumes, entraînant avec eux le Betrayer et l'abomination et scellant derrière eux les voies d'accès au royaume des mortels avec la Porte Divine. Ce n'est qu'ainsi qu'ils purent empêcher leurs frères corrompus de revenir physiquement sur le plan matériel. Malheureusement, pour les divinités premières, cette action s'accompagnait également d'une condamnation à l'exil. Les Créateurs ne seraient dorénavant jamais autorisés à visiter leur création.",
								"La disparition des dieux est connue sous de nombreux noms : la Seconde Étincelle pour ceux qui étudient les arcanes, et la Pénitence pour ceux qui cherchent à se rapprocher de leurs dieux. Le nom le plus courant pour cette période de guerre et de séparation divine est la Divergence, et elle a marqué la fin de l'Âge de l'Arcane.",
								"Beaucoup de temps s'est écoulé depuis, et le monde a pu renaître une fois de plus. Les dieux continuent d'influencer et de guider de l'autre côté de la Porte Divine, conférant savoir et pouvoir à leurs adorateurs, mais le chemin des mortels est désormais le leur. De nouvelles villes, de nouveaux royaumes et de nouvelles cultures ont repris le monde, se construisant sur les cendres des anciens. De nouvelles chansons emplissent l'air et l'espoir d'un avenir meilleur anime les gens jour après jour, tandis que des ruines enfouies et d'anciennes reliques rappellent à tous les peuples une époque plus sombre, marquée par des erreurs qui ne devraient jamais être répétées."

Ils finirent par asservir les coranites pour exploiter l'or et les pierres précieuses du ravin et pour assurer la domination des draconiques dans la région, laissant leur esprit libre de se concentrer sur la politique interne et le développement des arcanes."

										"En l'an 815 de l'ère chrétienne, un groupe d'anciens dragons chromatiques, le Conclave Chroma, a lancé un assaut inattendu sur Draconia. La puissante cité de Draconia fut immédiatement détruite et laissée à l'abandon dans le Ravin de Dreemoth. Un puissant dragon blanc appelé Vorugal, le Frigid Doom, revendiqua le ravin comme son nouveau domaine, tandis que le reste des dragons cherchait à conquérir d'autres régions d'Exandria. Ces événements secouèrent les nations de Wildemount, mettant la Concorde de Clovis et l'Empire Dwendalien en état d'alerte, tandis que la Dynastie Kryn se retira temporairement à Rosohna, craignant une autre attaque.",
										"Au fil du temps, Vorugal et l'ensemble du Conclave Chroma furent tués et le danger sembla s'être dissipé. Avec le démantèlement de Draconia, les coranites qui n'étaient plus esclaves étaient beaucoup plus nombreux que leurs anciens maîtres ; ils revendiquèrent leur liberté et punirent les draconiens survivants. Une poignée de nobles draconiens s'enfuirent vers la Côte de la Ménagerie ou l'Empire Dwendalien pour demander l'asile, laissant les corbeaux reconstruire la société draconique de Wildemount sur les ruines de leurs oppresseurs."

										"Récemment, l'intérêt de l'empire pour l'influence croissante des Kryns a conduit à une curiosité croissante sur la source des mystérieuses capacités arcaniques des Kryns. Les espions dwendaliens ont réussi à voler deux des quatre artefacts connus sous le nom de \"{@item luxon beacon|egw|beacons}\", qui semblaient être de puissantes sources d'énergie magique unique appelée dunamis. La reine lumineuse Leylas Kryn a lancé une initiative visant à voler les balises et à attaquer les forteresses dwendaliennes jusqu'à ce que ces reliques sacrées soient rendues. Aujourd'hui, en 835 PD, les escarmouches qui en résultent ont dégénéré en guerre totale. Une cinquième balise a récemment été découverte par l'Assemblée Cerberus, et la violence menace de s'étendre au-delà des Pics Ashkeeper et d'impliquer d'autres habitants de Wildemount dans le conflit."

Deux fois par an, les collecteurs de la dîme (surnommés les \"faucheurs\") visitent chaque ville impériale pour inspecter les ménages afin de trouver des registres et des preuves de revenus, et collecter un pourcentage de leurs gains en pièces de monnaie déterminé par le collecteur de la dîme.",

						"La dynastie Kryn règne sur les étendues du nord de Xhorhas et ne s'est révélée au monde qu'au cours du siècle dernier. Centrée autour - et sous - les ruines de Ghor Dranas dans l'est de Wynandir, la dynastie gouverne de nombreux cantons et petits villages où les Kryn ont aidé à établir un minimum de vie civilisée parmi les nomades du désert. Ils croient que les êtres qui ne sont pas encore irrécupérables peuvent être convertis à la lumière du Luxon, et luttent souvent avec les habitants indisciplinés des régions désolées, dans l'espoir de gagner des convertis à leur cause et à leur foi. Ceux qui acceptent la dynastie le font souvent parce qu'ils cherchent à se protéger des déchets de la Calamité qui errent dans les terres, ainsi que des éclaireurs de l'Empire Dwendalien.",
						"Les elfes noirs sont la race la plus peuplée de la dynastie Kryn. Les drows ont été les premiers à découvrir la première balise Luxon enterrée, il y a bien longtemps, avant qu'ils ne se détournent de Lolth et n'échappent à l'asservissement des Dieux Betrayer. Les elfes noirs ont revendiqué la redoutable citadelle de Ghor Dranas, ainsi que l'énorme réseau de cavernes souterraines qui constituent le Underdark de Wildemount. Les Kryn deviennent furtivement une force avec laquelle il faut compter.",
						"Les drows du Kryn, qui ont émergé des profondeurs obscures des cavernes de Xhorhas, pratiquent maintenant des périodes d'ensoleillement dans le cadre de leur culte, bien que leurs villes soient ombragées par la magie ombrale pendant les heures de clarté. Lorsqu'ils chassent, ou en temps de conflit, les guerriers du Kryn revêtent leur armure chitineuse caractéristique. Une série de petits conduits d'aération tissés à travers cette armure peuvent être ouverts pour émettre un fort bourdonnement afin d'intimider leurs ennemis lorsqu'ils chargent. Ce bruit a incité les étrangers à appeler les Kryn \"cricks\", en référence à ce vacarme semblable à celui des grillons.",
						"Les artefacts laissés par le Luxon et contenant son essence sont connus sous le nom de balises Luxon et sont convoités par la dynastie Kryn, qui y voit un élément central de sa civilisation. Si une âme éprouvée est rituellement liée à une balise Luxon, elle peut entrer dans un processus appelé la consécution : lorsqu'un mortel lié au Luxon meurt dans un rayon de 160 km d'une balise, celle-ci arrache son âme à l'au-delà auquel elle était destinée et la prépare à renaître dans un nouvel enfant dans ce même rayon. Lorsque cet enfant atteint l'adolescence, il commence à se souvenir des connaissances subtiles de ses expériences de vie passées, un processus appelé anamnèse. Grâce à la méditation avec un guide, il peut débloquer les souvenirs de ses vies antérieures et devenir un être plus complet. Lorsqu'une âme a suffisamment évolué pour croire qu'elle est prête à accueillir le Luxon, elle est appelée Umavi, ou \"âme parfaite\", et est révérée au sein de la société Kryn. Certains êtres qui se réincarnent naturellement, comme le phénix, sont considérés comme des créatures saintes qui portent en elles un éclat du Luxon.",
						"Si une vie se poursuit suffisamment longtemps pour atteindre un état de clarté appelé achess, où elle pense avoir appris tout ce qu'elle pouvait apprendre de sa vie actuelle, elle peut choisir de prendre part à un rituel de fin de vie, assistée par un Umavi à proximité d'une balise, la mettant ainsi sur la voie d'une nouvelle naissance. Bien que considérée comme un honneur au sein de la dynastie Kryn, cette pratique est incomprise et considérée comme barbare en dehors de leur culture.",
						"La dynastie des Kryn est une société restructurée à partir de l'histoire des Lolthites qu'ils ont rejetée. Le peuple de la dynastie est dirigé par le premier Umavi, connu sous le nom de la Reine Lumineuse Leylas Kryn. Sous le premier Umavi, il y a douze Dens nobles qui marquent les familles d'âmes qui ont vécu ensemble pendant des générations : Dens Kryn, Mirimm, Thelyss, Hythenos, Icozrin, Biylan, Tasithar, Duendalos, Daev'yana, Omrifar, Beltune et Zolaed. Lorsqu'on pense qu'une personne fait l'expérience de l'anamnèse, elle se soumet à une profonde méditation avec un guide formé aux voies de la consécution. Ce processus permet de restaurer les souvenirs de la vie passée, qui se mêlent ensuite aux souvenirs actuels.",
						"L'âme éveillée est alors réunie avec sa tanière. Les tanières grandissent au fur et à mesure que de nouvelles âmes entrent dans la consécration et rejoignent leurs rangs, et de nouvelles tanières sont créées à chaque génération. Les repaires les plus anciens, en particulier ceux dirigés par un Umavi, sont tenus en très haute estime et répondent généralement directement à la reine lumineuse. Plus l'âme est ancienne, plus elle a de prestige dans la dynastie. Sous les Dens de Rosohna, les guildes et les représentants des Dens gouvernent les autres cités de la dynastie qui s'étendent à travers Xhorhas, propageant la foi du Luxon et veillant sur tous les Xhorhasiens qui recherchent la sécurité de la civilisation.",
						"Cette structure sociétale apparemment bienveillante a un côté sombre. Un secret étroitement gardé par les plus hauts Umavi est un défi à la consécration appelé typhros : certaines âmes qui ont subi plusieurs cycles de la consécration sont rendues folles lorsque leur esprit ne peut concilier les souvenirs de plusieurs vies. Ceux qui succombent au typhros sont discrètement retirés de la dynastie et abandonnés dans les déserts ou tués par miséricorde loin des balises. Des signes de folie commencent à apparaître chez la Reine Brillante elle-même, mais ses proches font tout ce qu'ils peuvent pour protéger les autres de tels présages.",

Laissant de côté les enseignements du sort et de la destinée dispensés par certains membres du panthéon actuel, les adeptes du Luxon apprennent que le véritable pouvoir de l'univers provient du pouvoir du choix. De nombreux avenirs possibles attendent votre chemin, et l'univers tremble avec un pouvoir d'anticipation à l'approche de chaque décision. Ce pouvoir est appelé dunamis, l'énergie de la potentialité, et l'architecture coalescente des multiples futurs menant à chaque moment est libérée lorsqu'un résultat est amené à la réalité. C'est l'énergie qui imprègne chaque phare Luxon pour préparer les vies à venir, et c'est la base de l'artisanat divin et des capacités arcaniques uniques du Kryn.",

Environ 5 100 soldats sont disséminés dans l'Underdark sous Wildemount à différents endroits intéressants, beaucoup d'entre eux utilisant des vers violets contrôlés par la magie pour permettre aux unités d'élite de naviguer rapidement dans les cavernes.

						"L'Assemblée Cerberus a été créée il y a près de trois cents ans, lorsque les conflits et la compétition entre les seigneurs mages menaçaient de détruire l'ordre social de l'Empire Dwendalien. Les chefs de maison de ce conflit ont failli se détruire mutuellement lors de ce qu'on a appelé la Veille de Minuit Pourpre, une bataille arcanique dans la capitale de Rexxentrum qui a rasé deux quartiers de la ville, tuant des centaines de civils. Au plus fort de la violence, un parlement a été organisé et les seigneurs mages ont décidé de mettre de côté leurs différences et d'éviter une destruction mutuelle assurée, en s'unissant en un conclave unifié. Lorsqu'ils ont été traduits devant le roi pour qu'il juge leurs crimes, ils ont proposé un accord pour mettre officiellement en place le conclave et se soumettre entièrement à l'autorité du roi. Prenant le nom de Cerberus Assembly, une référence à une puissante union historique de mages durant l'Age d'Arcanum, les mages ont porté l'empire à de nouveaux sommets de puissance et d'expansion.",
						"Au cours des siècles qui ont suivi, l'Assemblée de Cerberus s'est subtilement implantée dans la plupart des facettes du gouvernement de l'empire, devenant une force politique et militaire dont beaucoup disent qu'elle pourrait rivaliser avec le roi lui-même. Cette réalité n'est pas perdue pour le conseil royal, et les tensions couvent souvent entre l'assemblée et la Couronne. Les mages de l'assemblée sont connus pour leur style de vie extravagant et leur histoire intimidante de contrôle politique et économique, et une grande partie de la population se méfie d'eux, bien que personne n'ose les contrarier, eux ou le roi. Il y a huit postes de direction au sein de l'assemblée, et les familles de chaque membre sont nommées comme membres inférieurs sans responsabilité, appelés \"annexes\". Les mages de l'assemblée se promènent dans tout l'empire sans crainte de discussion ou de résistance.",
						"Les membres sont élevés à l'un des huit postes principaux lors du décès d'un membre qui laisse un poste vacant, ou lorsqu'un membre permanent abdique son poste. Les membres restants recommandent alors des remplaçants et votent pour le mage qui occupera le poste nouvellement ouvert.",

Dans la poursuite de cet objectif, des agents de l'assemblée ont volé deux balises Luxon à la dynastie Kryn, bien qu'ils en aient ensuite perdu une au profit d'une bande d'aventuriers appelée les Puissants Nein. L'assemblée a consacré d'immenses efforts à l'étude et à l'exploitation de cette nouvelle forme de magie, sachant pertinemment que le vol des balises est à l'origine de la guerre actuelle."

Les chaînes qu'elle tenait sur ses drows étaient affaiblies, et ceux qui avaient trouvé une foi et un but renouvelés dans la découverte du Luxon abandonnèrent leur terrible maîtresse et se frayèrent lentement un chemin vers la surface pour reconquérir Ghor Dranas et se débarrasser de leur dieu malveillant pour l'éternité.",

Sa fureur brûlait d'une haine empoisonnée, et elle fulminait dans ses toiles en préparant sa vengeance contre sa progéniture ingrate et traîtresse. Le temps passa et sa sombre divinité se rétablit peu à peu, la Reine Araignée mit de côté sa fierté au profit de son désir de punir ; elle commença à séduire les esprits des gobelinoïdes, des beastfolks et des gens égarés des régions désolées, se glissant dans leurs rêves et les convainquant de l'aimer, les amenant à se joindre à sa violente haine pour la dynastie montante des Kryn. Elle a trouvé des drows qui se sentaient rejetés par les Dens de la dynastie et a exploité leurs peurs et leurs insécurités, amplifiant leur xénophobie à mesure que la dynastie recrutait de plus en plus d'étrangers à sa cause. Petit à petit, Lolth a développé un nouveau réseau d'adorateurs, d'espions et d'assassins dispersés.

Des mois de délibérations ont suivi pendant lesquels les monarques ont discuté de la meilleure façon d'établir l'harmonie sociale, de l'endroit où les nouvelles maisons seraient construites et de la façon d'étendre les disques de la ville pour accueillir une population plus permanente. Finalement, les deux monarques parvinrent à un accord que la majorité des nains et des elfes trouvèrent juste et tolérable.",

Composées de la famille Mardoon, de la famille Uttolot, de la famille Trebain et de la famille Jagentoth, les Tribus contrôlent toujours la plupart des affaires qui se déroulent dans la ville, tout en travaillant secrètement les unes contre les autres. Si chaque centre familial est généralement composé de parents par le sang ou par alliance, leurs employés sont également considérés comme faisant partie de la famille, tant qu'ils restent loyaux. Les Tribus opèrent sans symbole ou bannière unifiée, et leurs intérêts résident dans le recel de biens volés, l'importation et la fourniture de vice, et le contrôle de la population par la confusion, l'intimidation et la peur.",
						"La famille Mardoon est une centrale du crime dans les Terres sauvages grisonnantes, grâce à son vaste réseau de contacts étrangers ainsi qu'à son alliance prospère avec la Myriade. Connus pour leur sens aigu des affaires et leur amour des contrats exécutoires, les Mardoon préfèrent serrer des mains plutôt que de brandir des lames. Néanmoins, lorsque les contrats sont rompus, il faut faire des exemples, et de telles circonstances exigent un spectacle sanglant. La fortune de la famille provient des bordels, des bijoux et du commerce d'esclaves, souvent spécialisé dans les trouvailles exotiques de Xhorhas et d'ailleurs. Le leadership est partagé entre Lord Anselm Mardoon, Kriemhilde Mardoon, Ophelia Mardoon, Demis Mardoon et Rufus Mardoon.",
						"La famille Uttolot a acquis sa notoriété grâce à un réseau d'alliances commerciales familiales, ce qui en fait le principal importateur de marchandises difficiles à trouver aussi loin au nord de l'empire. Elle contrôle les portes de la brèche de Quannah, et tous ceux qui entrent ou sortent de la région doivent payer des péages aux Uttolot, ce qui fait d'eux un partenaire nécessaire aux autres familles, qu'elles le veuillent ou non. Ils s'adonnent au braconnage de bêtes et de monstres dangereux, et se heurtent souvent aux chasseurs de la Greytrader Union, un collectif de citoyens qui veulent améliorer la vie des habitants de Shadycreek Run. Contrairement aux autres familles, les Uttolot dépendent du Grudge Gang de Shadycreek pour la plupart de leurs muscles. Le leadership est partagé entre Lord Milos Uttolot, Mira Uttolot et Jagoda Uttolot.",
						"La famille Trebain est la plus discrète des maisons, préférant faire ses affaires par le biais d'intermédiaires et d'hommes de main. Elle vit au-delà des limites de la ville, au cœur de la forêt de Savalir, dans un réseau de fermes entourant une forteresse. La famille Trebain se concentre sur le contrôle des terrains de chasse et la récolte de reliques dans les ruines de Molaesmyr. Les intérêts de la famille la mettent en conflit permanent avec la famille Uttolot et l'Union des commerçants gris. Le triangle d'animosité entre les Uttolot, les Trebain et les Greytrader donne parfois lieu à des alliances étranges - après tout, l'ennemi de mon ennemi est mon ami, même si ce lien est temporaire. La direction de la famille est partagée entre Lord Darko Trebain, Juraj Trebain, Tatia Trebain et Zorka Trebain.",

Les entreprises commerciales les plus prospères de la famille comprennent l'assassinat, la culture et la distribution de substances illicites, et l'esclavage (ce qui les place en concurrence directe avec la famille Mardoon).

The cliffs enclose the dense and perilous Lushgut Forest, and this combination of deadly terrain has rendered most of the cliffs unfit for the construction of towns or cities. As such, the region has remained a monster-infested wilderness since time immemorial.",

The empire reached out to the more approachable members of the orc settlement of Bladegarden, offering them wages, resources, and access to imperial goods and services. A number of them became the cornerstone of the eastern branch of the Righteous Brand and emboldened the empire's military techniques with the prowess of the border-hardened orcs. Other orc clans who rejected these ideals were forced eastward into the Brokenveil Marsh and forgotten.",
														"From this accord, the new Righteous Brand training facility in the central Marrow Valley was established. Bladegarden was the site of one of the bloodiest battles of the Calamity; its name referred to the volume of weaponry scavenged by orcs from the war-ravaged earth, and has since been adapted to the idea that warriors are grown within its walls. Bladegarden is both a training complex and the core of orcish society in Western Wynandir. Contests of skill and might are commonplace among the recruits and their trainers. Even the merchants come from sturdier stock and often partake. A sense of honor and pride fills the ranks here, stoked by the rivalry between Bladegarden and Grimgolir.",
														"As scuffles with the Kryn escalated and a growing number of dragonborn refugees left Talonstadt to join the military, a certain belligerent mirth filled the warriors of Bladegarden. This oddly jovial wartime atmosphere was shaken when the Xhorhasian assault on the Ashguard Garrison proved far more swift and brutal than anyone predicted. However, now that the surviving Ashguard forces have retreated to Bladegarden and the scattered armies of the empire have moved east to join them, the city is as crowded and lively as ever—but morale is tenuous. One more defeat like the one at Ashguard could crack Bladegarden like a nut."

The predominantly dwarven society of Grimgolir prizes fine metals, finer craftsmanship, and proven skill on the battlefield, and their culture drills these virtues into every young dwarf, human, and halfling born in their city. Since days long past, the people of Grimgolir have waged eternal war on the monstrous denizens of the lightless caverns, in order to mine the precious mineral veins that suffuse the Dunrock Mountains.",

Every new recruit's first station is atop the dizzying cliffs, as an introduction to the hostile terrain of Xhorhas and to the monstrosities that wander out of the marsh below. The Grimgolir reputation for martial excellence soon reached the ears of the Dwendalian military, and the Crown made overtures to the ruling elders of the Grimgol dwarves, inviting them to peacefully become citizens of the empire. The negotiations were nearly spoiled by the Crown's simultaneous courtship of the orcs of Bladegarden, but a concordance was eventually reached. The empire granted Grimgolir an extremely generous trade agreement and all the benefits of imperial citizenship, along with unprecedented autonomy for an imperial vassal state, in exchange for the ability to marshal the Grimgol warriors to fight for the empire. As part of the empire's unified eastern front against Xhorhas, Grimgolir has aided in the training of the soldiers of Bladegarden, as well as the Rockguard and Ashguard Garrisons."

This has built a philosophy that breeds generation after generation of dwarves seeking ways to challenge themselves and prove their capability. Everyone born within the city learns the basics of armed and unarmed combat as a child—often making outsiders, merchants, and travelers somewhat uneasy with the knowledge that any native Grimgoliran could take them in a fight.",

This is especially true for the Grimgol dwarves, for most can trace their family lineage back to a famous warrior or two. However, other Grimgolirans find their calling as storytellers and artisans. Those unable to make a living as a warrior or as an artisan often find themselves as laborers in the service of the Bleeding Stone Syndicate, a massive business enterprise that controls the entire pipeline of ore excavation to weapon manufacture. The Bleeding Stone maintains mining facilities beneath the Dunrock Mountains, a network of railcart lines between the mines and Grimgolir, a cutting-edge blast furnace for ore smelting, and an army of smiths hammering ingots into blades, shields, and mail."

These arcane practitioners and scholars aid the king in engaging foreign interests, in developing magical technology to better oversee the land and enforce his will, and making use of the rare relics that the Crown confiscates from unearthed sites of pre-Calamity might. This arrangement affords the assembly homes in the Candles and across the major cities of the empire, as well as access to every Dwendalian political figure. Thus, members of the assembly are extremely influential and, by the nature of their arrangement, very carefully watched by the king. Most civilians swap rumors of demonic pacts and demigod-level magics at the assembly's disposal, adding to their aura of mystique among the common folk. When an assembly mage walks the streets of Rexxentrum or attends the halls of an establishment within the city, it is an event that everyone will be talking about for days to come."

However, the previous king, Everard Dwendal, loosened the laws applying to public discourse. This gave rise to a number of political figures who gathered the unhappy populace behind their philosophies. In response, King Everard established the Augen Trust, a network of spies working for the king to blackmail or corrupt these politicians. With these high-profile dissenters under the thumb of the Crown, controlling political discourse became easier, and politics within the empire became a tense game of cat and mouse. Forthright nobles and frustrated guild heads unswayed by propaganda, gold, or threats still dissent publicly, testing the boundaries of their influence.

The resulting collaborations have created incredible new crafts and means of circumventing the challenges of the region. Dwarven carving techniques blend with elven arcane knowledge to elevate architecture and excavation capabilities. Historical knowledge of the local vegetation meets refined herbalism to cultivate and grow cold-resistant crops. The crafting and smithing techniques of each lineage entwine and complement one another, making Uthodurnian goods that pass beyond the Greying Wildlands valuable indeed."

Over those years, they have forged ties of mutual respect, and romances and unions between elves and dwarves have also become increasingly common as the years progress. Though such partnerships were initially considered scandalous, they came to be met with tolerance, and eventually celebration. While an elf and dwarf may indeed produce offspring, the curiously stubborn nature of both ancestries produces a child that is either an elf or a dwarf, though a child of either race often inherits minor physical attributes from the other parent. Such children are affectionately referred to as attalwen, or \"two-hearted.\""

Many Uthodurnians come here to shop, enjoy the bustling atmosphere, or unwind with a hearty ale or piquant wine. Foreign travelers may be tickled to come across dwarves dancing to uncharacteristically whimsical elven music or elves enjoying dirty barroom games.",

But these beliefs have been strengthened in modern times by the clear-eyed marquis of Port Zoon, Alamads Haddou, who lays down laws in plain language and enacts swift justice by the letter of those laws."

Eons ago, when the flames of the Calamity burned across Exandria, the Betrayer Gods gathered in the realm that would eventually become Xhorhas. There, they found a people known as the dranassar. An ancestor race to the goblinoids, the dranassar were tall and beautiful, strong of body and mind, and fleet of foot. Their hair was thick and black, and their skin gleamed like gold. Most of the dranassar willingly served the divine beings that descended upon their land, but a few fought back against the Betrayer Gods' rule.",

When the armies of the Betrayer Gods wanted for skirmishers, Bane twisted the dranassar into goblins. When he was in need of loyal soldiers, he made them into hobgoblins. And when brute force was required, he sculpted them into bugbears. As the war of gods and mortals raged on, Bane corrupted even those dranassar who remained loyal to him.",

								"Dunamis is the primal magical energy of potentiality and actuality, an anticipatory arcane force that helps shape the multiverse and might very well be what holds its elements together, like an infinite web of unseen tethers. Manifesting as a translucent gray energy that shimmers and drifts like an ethereal cloud of mist when gathered, dunamis darkens as it vibrates and condenses to the moment of action or invocation, manipulating fundamental aspects of reality. Those who study to control and tap into this near-invisible power can subtly bend the flow of time and space by controlling the forces of localized gravity, peering into possible timelines to shift fate in their favor, and scattering the potential energy of their enemies to rob them of their potency.",
								"Dunamancy is an ancient, esoteric study of magic almost unknown across Exandria. Facets of dunamancy have quietly bled into the more common applications of spellcraft like an unrealized glimpse behind the curtain of creation. Mages who pursue the study of this strange and complex force call themselves dunamancers, and their interest in learning to alter the fabric of gravity, potential, and time often coincides with a hunger to understand the oldest mysteries of the cosmos.",

The hidden secrets of harnessing dunamis eventually found their way into the hands of the Cerberus Assembly and have continued to slowly disseminate across all Wildemount as a result.",
										"If you are considering a character pursuing a path involving the manipulation of dunamis, you can easily tie your story into the Kryn Dynasty and the ready access to dunamancy it provides. But you can also consider where else in the world dunamancy might have spread, and how its secrets have influenced your character's path. You might have stumbled into a cabal of defecting Kryn expatriates who teach you their ways, or you might have been entrusted with learning such secrets as a means of fighting the Kryn with their own power. Work with your Dungeon Master and figure out a fun and logical way that your character and the mysterious power of dunamancy might have crossed paths.",
										"In campaigns outside Wildemount, there is no factional control of dunamancy, so the implementation of this arcane discipline is entirely open. Talk to your Dungeon Master about how dunamancy might fit into their campaign, and how your character's story could be woven into that lore."

The events that occur as a result of these random rolls inform what kind of character the player has. A player who already has a character concept in mind can choose options from the tables instead of rolling randomly, ignoring anything that doesn't fit their character concept.

Let this tool inspire your imagination rather than limit it.",

It helps establish major events that happened to the character before the campaign began. Options for determining a character's favorite food and mysterious secrets can help further define a character's relationship to their homeland and the other party members.",

Completing a prophecy goal grants the character a mechanical benefit as a reward.",
