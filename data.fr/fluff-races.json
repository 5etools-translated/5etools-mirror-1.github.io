								"Nichés dans les hautes montagnes, au sommet de grands arbres, les aarakocra, parfois appelés oiseaux, suscitent crainte et émerveillement. De nombreux aarakocra ne sont même pas originaires du Plan Matériel. Ils viennent d'un monde plus lointain, des horizons infinis du plan élémentaire de l'air. Ce sont des immigrants, des réfugiés, des éclaireurs et des explorateurs, dont les avant-postes servent de points d'ancrage dans un monde à la fois étrange et étranger.",

Debout, l'aarakocra peut atteindre 1,5 m de haut, et il a des pattes longues et étroites qui se terminent par des serres acérées.",
										"Des plumes recouvrent leur corps. Leur plumage indique généralement l'appartenance à une tribu. Les mâles ont des couleurs vives, avec des plumes rouges, orange ou jaunes. Les femelles ont des couleurs plus discrètes, généralement brunes ou grises.

Ils peuvent passer des heures en l'air, voire des jours, en bloquant leurs ailes et en se laissant porter par les courants thermiques. Au combat, ils se montrent dynamiques et acrobatiques, se déplaçant avec une vitesse et une grâce remarquables, plongeant pour frapper leurs adversaires avec leurs armes ou leurs serres avant de se retourner et de s'envoler.",
										"Une fois en l'air, un aarakocra quitte le ciel avec réticence. Sur leur plan natal, ils peuvent voler pendant des jours ou des mois, n'atterrissant que pour pondre leurs œufs et nourrir leurs petits avant de se relancer dans les airs. Ceux qui parviennent à se rendre dans un monde du plan matériel trouvent l'endroit étrange. Ils oublient ou ignorent parfois les distances verticales et n'ont que de la pitié pour les terriens contraints de vivre et de travailler sur le sol."

										"La ressemblance des aarakocra avec les oiseaux ne se limite pas aux caractéristiques physiques. Les aarakocrates présentent de nombreux comportements similaires à ceux des oiseaux ordinaires. Ils sont pointilleux sur leur plumage, soignent fréquemment leurs plumes, nettoient et grattent les petits passagers qu'ils ont pu attraper. Lorsqu'ils daignent descendre du ciel, ils le font souvent près de bassins où ils peuvent attraper des poissons et se baigner.",
										"Beaucoup d'aarakocra ponctuent leur discours de gazouillis, des sons qu'ils utilisent pour mettre l'accent et nuancer le sens, tout comme un humain le ferait avec des expressions faciales et des gestes. Un aarakocra peut être frustré par les personnes qui ne saisissent pas ces nuances ; la menace d'un aarakocra peut être prise pour une plaisanterie et vice versa.",
										"L'idée de propriété déconcerte la plupart des aarakocrates. Après tout, à qui appartient le ciel ? Même lorsqu'on leur explique, ils trouvent d'abord la notion de propriété mystifiante.",
										"Par conséquent, les aarakocra qui ont peu d'interaction avec d'autres personnes peuvent être une nuisance lorsqu'ils tombent du ciel pour arracher le bétail ou piller les récoltes de fruits et de céréales. Les objets brillants et scintillants attirent leur attention. Ils ont du mal à ne pas cueillir le trésor et à le ramener dans leur village pour l'embellir. Un aarakocra qui passe des années parmi d'autres races peut apprendre à inhiber ces impulsions.",
										"L'enfermement terrifie l'aarakocra. Être cloué au sol, piégé sous terre ou emprisonné par la terre froide et inflexible est un tourment que peu d'aarakocra peuvent supporter. Même lorsqu'ils sont perchés sur une haute branche ou au repos dans leur maison au sommet d'une montagne, ils semblent alertes, les yeux en mouvement et le corps prêt à s'envoler."

Pour cette raison, il faut une circonstance exceptionnelle pour qu'un aarakocra quitte sa tribu et entreprenne la vie d'aventurier. Ni le trésor ni la gloire ne suffisent à les attirer hors de leur tribu ; une menace sérieuse pour leur peuple, une mission de vengeance ou une catastrophe sont généralement au cœur de la voie choisie par l'aventurier aarakocra.",
										"Deux autres circonstances peuvent appeler un aarakocra à l'aventure. Premièrement, les aarakocrates ont des liens historiques avec les Ducs du Vent d'Aqaa. Les individus exceptionnels honorent ce lien et peuvent rechercher les pièces manquantes du Bâton des Sept Parties, les restes d'un artefact façonné par les Ducs du Vent il y a longtemps pour vaincre le monstrueux champion de la Reine du Chaos, Miska l'Araignée-Loup.",

Récupérer les morceaux signifie gagner l'honneur et l'estime aux yeux du vaati qui l'a forgé et pourrait éventuellement restaurer une arme puissante pour se défendre contre les agents du mal élémentaire.",
										"Deuxièmement, les aarakocra sont les ennemis jurés des élémentaires de la Terre, en particulier les gargouilles qui servent Ogrémoch, le Prince de la Terre. Le mot aarakocra pour gargouille se traduit librement par \"pierre volante\", et les batailles entre aarakocra et gargouilles ont fait rage à travers les plans élémentaires de la Terre et de l'Air, débordant parfois sur un monde du plan matériel. Les aarakocrates de ce plan peuvent quitter leurs colonies pour venir en aide à d'autres humanoïdes engagés dans la lutte contre les cultes terriens et contrecarrer leurs efforts."

								"Les aven à tête d'épervier sont souvent attirés par la maîtrise des techniques de combat à distance, qu'il s'agisse du javelot qui est l'arme préférée de beaucoup, de l'arc ou d'autres armes lancées. Quelle que soit l'arme qu'ils utilisent, les aven planent et plongent dans l'air au-dessus de la mêlée, cherchant le moment opportun pour frapper exactement au bon endroit. En accord avec les enseignements du dieu de la solidarité, ils volent souvent en formations serrées avec d'autres aven dans leurs cultures, se soutenant et se protégeant mutuellement. Les avens sont très fiers de la précision de leurs attaques, grâce à leur vue perçante et à leurs points d'observation supérieurs. Ils considèrent la pointe acérée d'une {@item javelin|phb} ou d'une {@item arrow|phb} comme un symbole de leur amour de la précision, et certains initiés entretiennent des collections soigneusement entretenues de pointes de lances ou de flèches.",
								"Un nombre relativement faible d'aven des deux variétés finit par se concentrer sur le combat au corps à corps. Même là, ils utilisent leur capacité à voler à leur avantage, plongeant souvent sur leurs ennemis depuis une grande hauteur. La vitesse et la puissance d'un coup porté par un aven plongeant peuvent être tout à fait dévastatrices, mais une telle frappe présente un risque énorme pour l'aven comme pour sa cible. Un aven qui ne parvient pas à se relever du plongeon à temps peut subir des blessures encore plus graves que la cible de l'attaque. L'aven minimise souvent ce risque en lançant {@item javelin|phb|javelins} pendant qu'il plonge, puis en se relevant tôt après un lancer réussi."

Goblins brought this fey boon with them to worlds across the Material Plane, even if they don't remember the fey realm they inhabited before Maglubiyet's rise.

At the beginning of such a fight, this uncertainty can give an edge to the human combatant.",

A mage {@background initiate|psa} who identifies with Hazoret might cultivate zeal above all other virtues, master spells of fiery magic to channel that powerful emotion, and rely on raw energy and enthusiasm to get through the four trials leading up to Hazoret's final test. An {@background initiate|psa} dedicated to Oketra, on the other hand, relies on cooperation, solidarity, and teamwork to get through the trials—even Bontu's Trial of Ambition, which attempts to break down such bonds. To Oketra's disciple, ambition means a drive to help an entire crop of initiates achieve glory together, rather than exalting oneself over others. Humans with this viewpoint see their chosen virtue coloring all others, and believe that the five gods offer their people a choice of which virtue to emulate and emphasize."

Legends tell of the first kobolds emerging from the Underdark near the lairs of the earliest dragons. In some lands, kobolds serve chromatic or metallic dragons—even worshiping them as divine beings. In other places, kobolds know too well how dangerous those dragons can be and help others defend against draconic destruction.",

The roar of a kobold can express a range of emotion: anger, resolve, elation, fear, and more. Regardless of the emotion the kobold expresses, the roar resonates with draconic power."
